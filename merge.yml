Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Indrajit was excited with rage, spoke harsh words
and rushed forward in fury.
Indrajit was looking like Yama the lord of Death at the time of dissolution of the
world, sitting in a well-decorated and distinguished chariot yoked with black horses, having
upraised sword and weapons, raising a big terrific enormous strong and swift bow and laying hold of
arrows which can torment the enemies.
The mighty the destroyer of adversaries, wielding a large bow, fully adorned, and
seated in a chariot saw that Lakshmana who was embellished with his own splendor.
Indrajit hurriedly spoke to those foremost of monkeys and to this Lakshmana, who
ascended Hanuma's back with a splendor of the sun shining on Mount Udaya and also with Vibhishana
as follows: "You behold my prowess now."
"Now, you can face an unconquerable stream of arrows, like rain, released in the
sky, as discharged from my bow in the battle-field."
"Today my arrows released from my large bow will destroy your bodies, as fire
consumes a pile of cotton."
"Today, I will send all of you to the world of Yama the lord of Death, by piercing
you with my sharp arrows and hurling the pikes, javelins and lances on you."
"Who can stand before me, while I release streams of arrows with my swift-hand in
battle, thundering like a cloud?"
"Earlier on that day, in a nocturnal battle, both of you along with Sugreeva and
other followers, were made unconscious by my arrows which were like thunderbolts and tips of
missiles as also you were made to fall down on the floor."
"Do you not have that remembrance? I presume clearly that you are on the road to
Yama the lord of Death, since you have come to give battle to me, enraged as I am, like a venomous
serpent."
Enraged in hearing that roaring of Indrajit, Lakshmana then spoke the following
words, with a courageous countenance.
"O demon! It has been proclaimed by you about the successful conclusion of your
tasks, eventhough it is difficult to achieve them. He alone is clever, whoever carries through his
undertakings in practice."
"O evil-minded one! You are thinking that you have accomplished your end, by
proclaiming through word alone, the achievement of your end, which is difficult to attain for
anyone, though you, as such, lack in capacity to achieve your purpose."
"The path, which was followed on that day by you, becoming invisible in the
battle-field, is the one trodden by thieves and is not the path followed by valiant ones."
"O demon! Having reached the range of your arrows, I am standing before you.
Therefore show your prowess today. Why should you brag with your words?
Hearing those words, the mighty Indrajit, victorious in battle, reaching his
terrific bow, released sharp arrows from it.
Duly reaching Lakshmana, the arrows released by Indrajit, which rushed with great
speed and were as deadly as the venom of serpents, fell like the hissing of snakes.
The swift Indrajit, the son of Ravana, with his arrows of very great velocity, in
that battle, struck Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious body-marks.
That glorious Lakshmana, drenched in blood, with his body very much wounded by
arrows, shone like a smokeless flame.
Mulling over his own feat, Indrajit for his part, approaching Lakshmana and emitting
an exceedingly loud roar, spoke the following words:
"The sharp-edged and deadly arrows, with their wings, released from my bow, will now
take your life, O Lakshmana!"
"O Lakshmana! Let a number of Jackals, multitude of hawks and vultures descend upon
you, when struck down by me, you are dead."
"The exceedingly evil-minded Rama now itself can see you, a mere kshatriya (military
class only for a name sake), ever ignoble and his devoted brother, killed by me."
"O Lakshmana! Rama will see you, struck down by me today, with your armour dropped
down, bow thrown about and head dismantled."
Lakshmana, understanding the sense of the word, replied in the following logical
words to the enraged Indrajit thus speaking harshly.
"O evil-minded one! Give up strength of speech in your empty words. O demons! You
are doing cruel acts. Why do you indulge in such idle talk? Make it active with your good
work."
"O demon! Without performing that act, why do you boast yourself here? Perform that
act by which I can believe your brag."
"O the worst of persons! Without speaking even a few harsh words, without abusing
you and without bragging myself, Lo! I will kill you."
Thus speaking, Lakshmana stretching five steel arrows upto the ear, dug them into
the demon's chest with a great speed.
The arrows, blazing like serpents and feathered with fine plumes, shone like
sun-rays in that demon's chest.
Struck with arrows by Lakshmana, that enraged Indrajit pierced in return three
arrows well-directed towards Lakshmana.
That fight between Lakshmana, the foremost among men and Indrajit, the formost among
demons, who wished to conquer one over the other in battle, was most terrific and tumultuous.
Both were endowed with strength. Both were distinguished for their prowess. Both
were exceedingly difficult to conquer and peerless in strength and courage.
Those two heroes, who were difficult to overcome in battle, fought at that moment
like two plants figuring in the sky and like Indra and Vritra, the demon.
Then, the two warriors, who were engaged in releasing several streams of arrows,
fought like two lions. Lakshmana the foremost among humans and Indrajit the foremost among demons
fought with rejoice.
Thereupon, Lakshmana the tormentator of enemies, fitting his arrows to his bow,
released arrows on Indrajit, hissing like an enraged serpent.
Hearing the twang of the bow-string of Lakshmana, Indrajit the Chief of demons
became pale-faced and fixed his gaze on Lakshmana.
Seeing Indrajit (the son of Ravana) pale-faced, Vibhishana spoke as follows to
Lakshmana, who was fully absorbed in the fight.
"O the long-armed Lakshmana! I infer on the strength of the indications which I see
in Indrajit, that he is disappointed. There is no doubt about it. Make haste."
Thereupon, fitting to his bow sharp arrows, resembling poisonous snakes, Lakshmana
discharged those arrows which looked like serpents full of venom to him.
Hit by Lakshmana with arrows, which invaded all his senses, like the hit of Indra's
thunderbolt, Indrajit became stupefied for a moment.
Regaining his consciousness within a moment, with his senses restored, that Indrajit
saw the valiant Lakshmana engaged in the battle.
With blood-red eyes in anger, Indrajit walked towards Lakshmana. Approaching
Lakshmana, he again spoke the following harsh words to him:
"Don't you remember my prowess in the first encounter, when you along with your
brother, was bound by me and you wriggled on the floor?"
"At first, both of you along with your foremost warriors in a major encounter, were
indeed laid down unconscious on the ground, by my arrows which were equal to Indra's
thunderbolt."
"The fact that you desire to attack me means that either the remembrance of it no
longer exists in you or I presume you desire to go clearly to the abode of Yama the lord of
Death."
"If my prowess was not witnessed by you in the first encounter, I will show it
today. Stand ready for it now."
Thus speaking, he struck Lakshmana with seven arrows and Hanuma with ten excellent
sharp-edged arrows.
Then, the valiant Idnrajit with anger and with twice as much vehemence, wounded
Vibhishana with a hundred well-aimed arrows.
Seeing that feat accomplished by Indrajit, yet disregarding it, deriding it by
saying "This is noting" and taking up terrific arrows, the fearless and enraged Lakshmana the
younger brother of Rama and foremost among men, then discharged them against Indrajit in
battle.
"O demon! Heroes who come to battle do not strike like this. These arrows of yours
are light, weak and mild indeed."
"Warriors, who wish to win in battle, do not fight like this." Thus speaking,
Lakshmana the wielder of a bow, streamed forth arrows on him.
A large golden armour, broken to pieces by Lakshmana's arrows, slipped down in the
middle of chariot, like a cob-web of stars falling from the sky.
The valiant Indrajit, with his armour disheveled by the steel arrows, was wounded in
battle and looked like the sun at dawn.
Thereafter, the valiant Indrajit of terrific prowess was enraged and wounded
Lakshmana with a thousand arrows in battle.
The large celestial armour of Lakshmana broke into pieces. The two warriors vied
with each other in offence and retaliation in their attack.
Those two warriors, with their entire bodies lacerated in combat, smeared with blood
all around and breathing heavily, fought the battle tumultuously.
Thos mighty warriors, skilled in warfare, were cutting through each other, for a
long time, with sharp arrows.
Those two heroes f terrific prowess stay on strenuously trying to secure their own
victory, covered as they were, all over with a multitude of arrows as also their armour and
standards torn to pieces. They stood emitting hot blood, as two water-falls gushing hot water.
Much of a time lapsed while the two warriors fought loosing terrific stream of
arrows, then with an awful clamour, like two dark destructive clouds raining from the sky. They
neither trned their back from the battle, nor experienced any fatigue.
Displaying their missiles again and again, the two warriors, who were excellent
among those skilled in the use missiles, fastened a net work of arrows both large and small, in the
sky.
Loosing their arrows faultlessly, gracefully and easily in a wonderful way, both the
man and the demon carried on a tumultuous and terrific war.
Their terrific and tumultuous sound could be heard one by one repeatedly. That sound
created a tremble in people, like a violent thunder-storm.
That clamour of those two warriors, who were engaged thus in that martial act,
resembled the rumbling of two dreadful thundering clouds in the sky.
Those two mighty and glorious warriors, who were determined to gain victory over one
another, wounded with golden-shafted steel arrows, were profusely giving out blood.
Fallen on their limbs, the golden-shafted arrows, dropped on the battle-field,
smeared with blood and pierced into the surface of the earth.
Some more arrows released by those two warriors clashed in thousands with sharp
weapons in the sky and shattered and tore them.
The terrific pile of arrows in battle appeared like a mass of sacred Kusha grass by
the side of two blazing fires at a sacrifice.
The wounded bodies of those two mighty warriors shone like Kimshuka and Shalmali
(silk-cotton) trees in full blossom, deprived of leaves.
Indrajit and Lakshmana who were time and again wishing to attain victory one over
the other, carried out tumultuous and terrific battle.
In the combat, Lakshmana was striking Indrajit and Indrajit too was striking
Lakshmana. Both of them were striking each other and did not experience any weariness.
With a multitude of arrows dug deep into their bodies, those two warriors, of great
prowess and swiftness, shone like two mountains shooting forth plants from them.
At that time, all their limbs, dampened with blood and thickly covered with arrows
shone very much like blazing fires.
A lot of time lapsed in the meanwhile past the two warriors. They neither turned
their back from the battle nor experienced any fatigue.
Then, to relieve martial weariness of Lakshmana, who did not experience defeat in
any facet of war, the great-souled Vibhishana, offering agreeable and salutary words, took up his
position, on reaching the battle-field.The sage Vasishta, the excellent one among the speakers having eloquence, spoke to that Bharata, Kaikeyi's son who was thus tormented with grief.
"O, the greatly illustrious prince! My blessing to you. You have lamented long
enough. Perform in an excellent way, the last rites of the king."
Hearing the words of Vasishta, Bharata conversant with his duty fell prostate and
proceeded with all the arrangements for the obsequies.
Raising the body of king Dasaratha, from the vessel where it had been immersed in
oil, seeming as it were asleep with face in the color of gold, that son Bharata placed it in a magnificent couch, adorned with every kind of precious stone and in a great grief, lamented.(as follows):
"O, king! Having sent into exile the virtuous Rama and Lakshmana who is possessed of great strength, while I was away from home and had not yet returned, what did you intend to do?"
"Where will you go, leaving this person (me) who was distressed and bereft of Rama the unwearied one in action and the excellent one among men?"
"O, king! O, father! Who is supposed to see the welfare and security of your city of Ayodhya, while you have departed for heaven and while Rama has gone, taking refuge in a forest?"
"O, king! Bereft of you and deprived of its lord, this earth does not look charming. To me, this city is looking like a night without a moon."
The great sage Vasishta again spoke the following words to that Bharata who was
distressed in mind and thus lamenting.
"O, mighty armed Bharata! Without hesitation or repining, carry out the funeral
rites of the king that should be done."
"Be it so" answered Bharata and obedient to Vasishta's command, he summoned speedily the appointed priests who were knowing the rules of the funeral rites."
The fires of that king were prepared outside the chamber and kindled in accordance with the rituals by the priests and the sacrificial attendants.
The attendants were choked with tears in their throats and disconsolate in their
mind, made the dead king to mount on a small palanquin and carried it away.
The people went along the path, scattering silver, gold and various kinds of clothes in front of the king.
In the same manner, some others brought sandal wood, sweet aloes, different fragrant essences, with leaps of Sarala Padmaka and Devadaru woods and many other kinds of fragrant substances, went there and threw them into the funeral pile. Thereafter the appointed priests caused the king's body to lie down there in the midst of the funeral pyre.
Then, those priests engaged for the benefit of the king poured oblations into the
fire and recited sacred texts (relevant to the funeral rites). Those among the priests, who could recite the hymns of Samaveda, chanted them according to the rules.
Then, his ladies, encircled by elders mounted palanquins or other vehicles, as
deserving and departed from the city to that place.
Then, the appointed priests as well as Kausalya and other women who were tormented with grief, circumambulated in anti clockwise direction that king who was lying on a funeral pile.
At that time the crying sounds of thousands of women, pitiably weeping with agony, were heard like the sounds of female curlew birds.
Thereafter, the lamenting ladies deprived of their grit wept again and again and
descended from their vehicles at the bank of Sarayu River.
Along with Bharata, the royal women, the ministers and family priests offered their oblations with water and entered the city with their eyes filled in tears and spent ten days with great difficulty by sleeping on bare floor.Seeing that very great exploit executed by the chiefs of monkeys in the battle,
Akampana was seized with a fierce anger.
Witnessing that work of the enemies, his features were distorted by anger and
brandishing his powerful bow, Akampana addressed his charioteer in these words.
"Drive the chariot quickly to that place, for, those monkeys are killing innumerable
demons on the battle field."
"Those arrogant monkeys of terrific ferocity, armed with trees and rocks, dare to
affront me here."
"I wish to kill those andicious monkeys, who are seen herassing all the army of
demons."
Thereafter, in his chariot, drawn by fast-moving horses, Akampana the most skillful
of chariot-warriors, with a hail of darts, assailed the monkeys from a distance.
The monkeys were no longer able to maintain their formation, much less fight in the
battle. all of them were crushed under the shifts of Akampana and took to their heels.
Seeing those companions, getting under the sway of death pursued by Akampana's
darts, the mighty Hanuman went to their rescue.
Seeing Hanuman their great leader, all those valiant and the best of the monkeys
together rallied and grouped themselves boldly round him.
Observing Hanuman's courage, those excellent monkeys took shelter in his
powerfulness and became powerfulness and became powerful indeed.
Akampana, like Mahendra the Lord of celestials, assailed a hail of arrows on
Hanuman, who remained as firm as a rock.
Heedless of the flood of weapons that fell upon his body, the mighty Hanuman
resolved in his mind to slay Akampana.
Laughing heartily , that Hanuman, the son of Maruta the wind-god and possessing a
great splendour, leapt on the demon, causing the earth to shake as it were.
As he roared burning with energy, the form of Hanuman became difficult to overpower,
like a blazing fire.
Knowing himself to be bereft of any weapon, Hanuman the excellent monkey, with a
rage, uplifted a mountain quickly.
That valiant Hanuman, seizing a very great mountain with one hand and letting up a
roar, began to spin it rapidly.
Thereafter, as formerly in an encounter Indra the Lord of celestials hurled his
thunderbolt at Namuchi, Hanuman rushed towards Akampana.
Beholding that crag flying towards him, Akampana shattered it even from a distance
by means of his great crescent-shaped arrows.
Seeing that rocky peak shatterd in the air by the demon's arrows and falling in
pieces, Hanuman became mad with anger.
Approaching an Ashwakarna tree as large as a mountain, in the transport of rage that
possessed him, that Hanuman uprooted it speedily.
Taking hold of that Ashvakarna tree with large branches, in his great strength,
Hanuman with immense delight spinned it, while standing on the ground.
Then, the highly enraged Hanuman began to run with great strides, breaking down the
trees by his strength and tearing up the earth with his feet.
Hanuman struck down elephants as also who rode upon them and charioteers with their
chariots and the terrific infantry of demons.
Seeing that Hanuman, like unto Yama the Destroyer of vital Breaths, full of wrath
armed with a tree and taking off lives, the demons took of flight.
The valiant Akampana, beholding that Hanuman who was enraged and rushing on, sowing
terror among his soldiers, was greatly perturbed and set up a mighty shout.
With fourteen sharp arrows that tore the flesh, that Akampana pierced the highly
valiant Hanuman.
Riddled with sharp-pointed shafts, that warrior Hanuman appeared like a mountain on
which a number of plants shooted up.
That mighty Hanuman of great strength with a large body shone like a fire without
smoke and resembled a blooming Ashoka tree.
Thereafter, showing a great haste in uprooting another tree, Hanuman struck the head
of Akampana the General of demons.
Struck with a tree by that high-souled and enraged Hanuman, that demon fell down and
died.
Seeing their leader Akampana lying lifeless on earth, all the demons trembled as the
trees do during an earthquake.
All those defeated warriors, throwing their arms, escaped in the direction of Lanka,
terrified, pursued by those monkeys.
Their hair loosened, bewildered, their pride broken by defeat, their limbs dripping
with sweat, those demons fled, blowing out their breaths.
Mad with fear, looking back again and again and crushing each other in haste, they
entered the city.
When those demons had entered Lanka, all the mighty monkeys approached Hanuman and
paid homage to him.
That Hanuman, of noble nature honoured all those delighted monkeys, in accord with
their rank and the occasion.
The triumphant monkeys shouted in accord with their nighty and once again dragged
the demons who were still alive there on the battle-field.
That great monkey, born of Maruta having encountered and killed the demons, enjoyed
the same renown as Vishnu when he overcame the mighty and terrific demon of immense power
destroying his enemies in the forefront of the battle.
Then, the troops of deities along with Rama himself, the exceedingly strong
Lakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys and the mighty Vibhishana paid homage to Hanuman.This chapter is removed from the critical edition and retained by traditional versions There 
			are discussions on this chapter whether it is the original work or an interpolated one. 
			Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana's character inevitably has continuity 
			in the war scene at the end.
Then on going hurriedly from Janasthaana and on speedily entering Lanka Akampana spoke these words to 
Ravana. 
"Oh, king, many demons positioned in Janasthaana are killed, Khara is also killed in war, and somehow 
I have come here. 
Thus said, then that ten-faced Ravana is infuriated with bloodshot eyes, and as though to burn down 
whole world with his radiance he spoke this to Akampana. 
"Who is that dead-and-gone that has destroyed my indomitable Janasthaana? Who is it that has indeed 
opted for no recourse in all of the worlds? 
"Evoking indignation in me it is really impossible for Indra to be happy; even for Kubera - no; for 
Yama - no; why them, even Vishnu cannot be happy. 
"I am the End-Time for the Time-god himself, I will burn down the Fire-god, and I am capable of conjoining 
Death with the virtue of deathliness. 
"If I am enraged I will incinerate Sun-god or Fire-god just with my radiance, I will halt even the impetuosity 
of Wind-god with that of mine." Thus Ravana said about himself. 
Akampana with his palms adjoined and voice hesitant with fear sought for the clemency of that decahedral 
demon Ravana who is enraged in that way. 
When the supremo of demons Dasha-griiva pardoned him then that Akampana spoke these words, unfalteringly 
and trustfully. 
"He is a youth whose shoulders are mighty, arms round and lengthy, built like that a lion, who is the 
son of Dasharatha and known as Rama. 
"He is blue-black in complexion, a highly renowned one with matchless might and valour, a magnificent 
one such as he is he slew Duushana along with Khara in Janasthaana." 
On hearing the words of Akampana, the chief of demons Ravana, spoke these words hissing like a kingly 
serpent. 
"The question is whether that Rama arrived at Janasthaana associated with Indra and along with all of 
the immortal gods? Oh, Akampana, speak about it. 
Akampana again detailed about the might and valour of that great souled Rama on hearing that sentence 
of Ravana. 
"Rama means someone who is highly resplendent, an ablest archer among all archers, one who is endowed 
with divine missiles and divine attributes, and he is the one who conducts warfare with a supreme conduct. 

"And a mighty one with redly eyes and drumbeat like voice, and whose face is shiny like the full-moon 
is Rama's selfsame younger brother known as Lakshmana. 
"Alike the wind associating with fire this Lakshmana is associated with that glorious and nonpareil 
prince Rama, and that firestorm, namely Rama, destroyed Janasthaana. 
"They are not any great souled gods or any heavenly beings as such, hence there is no need to doubt 
about it. Rama unloosened his gold-finned and feather-winged arrows, which on becoming five-faced serpents 
started consuming the demons. 
"To whichever nook those demons smitten by fear of those serpent-like are fleeing, they have seeing 
Rama alone standing afore them in that corner, and oh, merited king Ravana, in this way your Janasthaana 
is totally ruined by that Rama.  
On hearing the words of Akampana Ravana said these words, "I will to go to Janasthaana to kill Rama 
along with Lakshmana." 
When Ravana said so then Akampana said these words in reply, " listen, oh, king, what all has happened, 
and of what in actuality is Rama's spirit and grit. 
"Rama, the highly renolwned, is invincible just by braving against him, for that Rama in fury can stall 
the onrush of a plethoric river with his arrows. 
"That magnificent Rama can collapse even the firmament along with its starlets, stars and planets, and 
he even can elevate the earth if it were to collapse. 
"On breaching the shoreline of the ocean with his arrows that lord Rama can deluge worlds, and he can 
stem the tide of turbulent ocean, or can even stall the agent of that turbulence, namely the wind. 
"That great valorous and the ablest among humans is capable to destroy all the worlds with his valour, 
and even capable of creating the people again.
Or, again dissolving all the worlds into himself, that great contemplator who transcends all is even 
capable of creating the creation again from out of him. 
"Oh, Dashagriiva, it is impossible to conquer that Rama in war for your, either singly or along with 
the hosts of the demon-supporters of yours, as one heaven cannot be won by many sinners. 
"I do not think that he is killable even for all god and demons, and this is the idea to kill him, and 
to this you may listen attentively. 
"An excellent woman in the world is there, a youthful one with symmetrical limbs, a jewel-like lady 
adorned with jewellery, that slender-waisted one who is known as Seetha is his wife. 
"No goddess can be likened to that mature lady; a gandharva female - no; a apsara female - no; a pannaga 
female -no, then how can there be a woman of her like? 
"You forcefully abduct his wife when she is in solitude, and indeed Rama will not exist reft of Seetha." 
Akampana advised Ravana in this way. 
The chief of demons Ravana favouring that idea thought of it and that mighty armed Ravana then spoke 
to Akampana. 
"Agreed! I wish to go alone early in the morning with a charioteer and I delightfully wish to lead Vaidehi 
into the elegant city Lanka." Ravana declared that way. 
Saying so Ravana journeyed in a chariot that is yoked with mule-like horses, and that has the dazzling 
of the sun, whereby all the directions are made to glitter. 
That opalescent chariot of the lord of demons while speedily progressing through starry way shone forth 
as if it is the moon in clouds. 
On going to the hermitage of Maareecha which is at a distant place Maareecha the son of Tataka received 
Ravana and venerated that king of demons with sweetmeats and savouries that are unavailable to humans. 

Offering proper seat and water for washing feet and hands Maareecha personally attended Ravana and spoke 
to him this sentence that is worded meaningfully. 
"Oh, king and supremo of demons, I am anxious to know whether everything safe and secure to the inhabitants 
of your kingdom, for I am not in the know of the reason by which now you have come here rushingly. 
When Maareecha said so to him that greatly radiant one who is a sententious speaker that Ravana thereafter 
spoke this sentence. 
"Oh, sire, Rama who is indefatigable in warring has ruined my security stationed at Janasthaana, and 
in war he even brought down all of Janasthaana which is undefeatable so far, such as I am, to me you 
have to render friendly help in kidnapping Rama's wife." 
On hearing the words of that chief of demons, Maareecha spoke these words, "who broached the subject 
of Seetha with you, an enemy in the fakery of a friend? Oh, tigerly demon, who is that censurable one 
that is unhappy with you, since he is giving such a self-ruinous advise? 
" 'Seetha may be brought to Lanka...' who said it, say him to me, who is that one desiring to cut off 
the prominence of all the demons in all worlds in saying so?
"Who is desirous of getting a zenithal demon ruling all the three worlds to be cut-off when he said 
that Seetha shall be brought to Lanka?
"Who is saying that Seetha is to be brought to Lanka with a desire to get your apogeal ten-heads that 
are prominent among all the clansmen of demons to be cut-off? 
"Also, he who has motivated you in this way is an undoubted enemy of yours, for he wanted to extricate 
the fangs of a snake from its mouth, of course, through you. 
"By whom and by which purpose of his you are made to blunder upon this awry path, oh, king, it is as 
good as his hitting hard on your head while you are fast asleep. 
"Oh, Ravana, it will be unbefitting to raise an eye to see Rama in war, who will be then like a majestic 
elephant that has an impeccable dynasty and bloodline as its mammoth trunk, personal radiance as its 
indomitable might, very firm pair of arms as its pernicious tusks, more so, who will be with the redolence 
of the irrepressible lineage of Raghava-s. 
"To be in the midst of war itself is the fury of that lion called Rama, by which that lion raises its 
tail touching the back of its trunk, that lion is all-inclusive with forelegs, paws, and claws that 
are included in arrows, while its fangs are swords, and it is the killer of the deer called the expert 
killer-demons, and mind you, do not dare to rouse that sleeping man-lion. 
"His bow is crocodilian, his shoulder-speed is quagmire, his arrows are tidal, and the great immensity 
of his war itself is a tideland, and oh, king of demons, it is inapt of you to slide down into the much-ghoulish 
mouth of that abyssal ocean, called Rama. 
"Oh, lord of Lanka, be appeased towards Rama, be quietened and gently proceed to Lanka. You take delight 
in your wives, and let Rama be delighting with wife in forests." Thus Mareecha spoke to Ravana. 
When thus said by Maareecha that ten faced Ravana returned to his city Lanka and entered his best house 
and home. A valiant demon by name Prahasta, the commander-in-chief, appearing like a dark
cloud, joined his palms in salutation and spoke these words.
"All gods, demons, gandharvas, devils, birds and serpents can be attacked by you in
battle. Why to talk about two human beings?"
"All of us, in good faith but with negligence, were cheated by Hanuma. That monkey
cannot go alive, while I am alive."
"I shall make the entire earth extending upto the ocean, along with mountains
forests and woods, bereft of monkeys. You command me."
"Oh, Ravana! I shall arrange for your defence from that monkey. Not a little trouble
will come to you on account of your guilt (abduction of Seetha)."
A demon by name Durmukha, being seriously enraged, spoke to him as follows: "This
humiliation meted out to us by that monkey is indeed not to be tolerated."
"This insult to the city of Lanka and the palaces together with attack by Sugreeva
on the glorious Ravana are still outrageous."
"Proceeding at this moment alone, I shall destroy those monkeys, whether they
entered the ocean or the subterranean region or the sky."
Thereafter the very strong Vajradamshtra, beset with great anger, took hold of a
terrific iron club smeared with flesh and blood and spoke (as follows):
"What work for us with that pitiable and miserable Hanuma, when Rama along with
Lakshmana and Sugreeva who are difficult to be conquered exist?"
"Now itself, with this iron club, killing Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva after
perturbing the army of monkeys, I shall come back."
"Oh, king! If you are willing, hear my words further. One who is skilled din a
stratagem alone will be without lassitude and can indeed defeat the enemies."
O, king of demons! Thousands of demons able to change their form at will courageaous
appalling terrifying to look at and firm (in their purpose) can wear human body approach Rama
without embarrassment and all speak to Rama (as follows).
"We have been despatched by Bharata, your younger brother. He is summoning his
forces and will surely come here soon."
"Carrying spikes, javelins and maces together with arrows and swords in hand, we
will quickly go there from here soon."
"Standing as groups in the sky and beating that army of monkeys with a mighty hail
of stones and missiles, we should send them to the world of Death."
"If Rama and Lakshmana thus approach softly into our trap they will surely abandon
their lives as they are taken away by the trap."
Thereafter Kumbhakarna's son, by name Nikumbha, strong and powerful, became very
angry and spoke (as follows) to Ravana, who made people cry.
All of you stay along with the king. I alone will kill there, Rama along with
Lakshman, Sugreeva along with Hanuma and all the monkeys also.
Then, a demon by name Vajrahanu who was resembling a mountain, becoming enraged and
licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue, spoke as follows:
"You do your occupations freely redeemed of mental pain, play comfortably and drink
spirituous liquor without any worry. I alone will devour the entire army of monkeys."
At this time I alone will kill Sugreeva along with Lakshmana Hanuma along with
Angada and all monkeys.Seeing Ravana killed by the great-souled Rama, the female-demons were stricken with
grief and rushed out from their gynaecium.
Even though impeded now and then by their maid servants, they were rolling in the
dust of the streets, with their hair dishevelled, tormented as they were with grief like cows that
had lost their calf.
Issuing out of the northern gate along with demons and penetrating into the terrific
battle-field, searching for their husband, who had been killed and crying out, "Ah my lord! Ah my
husband!" they all ran hither and thither on the ground which was covered with headless trunks and
rendered muddy with blood."
Those women, who were overcome with grief about the death of their husband, having
their eyes filled with tears, loudly lamented like female-elephants who had lost the leader of
their herd.
Those women saw the gigantic Ravana, who was endowed with a great strength and
invested with a great splendour, lying killed on the ground, like a heap of black collyrium.
Suddenly seeing their husband lying in dust of the battle-field, those women fell
down on his limbs, like uprooted wild creepers.
A woman wept, embracing him out of great regard, another woman clinging to his feet
and another, catching hold of his neck.
A woman rolled over the ground, with her arms thrown up. On seeing the face of her
deceased husband, another woman fell into a swoon.
Keeping Ravana's head in her lap, a woman, looking at his face, wept moistening that
face with her tears, as dew drops moisten a lotus-flower.
"That Ravana, by whom Indra was thrown into fear, Yama was struck with terror, by
whom Kubera the king was deprived of Pushpaka the aerial car, and by whom fear was caused on the
battle-field in the Gandharva the celestial musicians, in the sages and the great-souled gods, lies
killed in the battle-field."
"This danger has come from a mortal to him, who did not conceive any fear from the
demons or the gods or even the serpents for that matter!"
"Here lies killed in battle, by a pedestrian man coming from Ayodhya, that Ravana,
who was incapable of being killed by gods and even so by devils and demons too."
"He who could not be killed by gods, Yakshas and demons alike, could be killed by a
mortal like one devoid of strength."
Thus uttering, those women of Ravana, wailing as aforesaid, burst into tears. They
once more and repeatedly lamented, stricken, as they were, with grief (as follows):
"For your own death, Seetha was borne away by you, who did not listen to your near
and dear ones, who always offered friendly counsel to you. The demons were struck down. Here, stand
we (your consorts) as well as your own self, struck down now."
"Though tendering salutary advice to you, Vibhishana your beloved brother, was
harshly scolded through ignorance by you, who sought your own destruction."
"If you had restored Seetha a princess of Mithila to Rama, this appallingly terrific
disaster, which has robbed us of every root, would not have befallen us."
"If you had restored Seetha to Rama, Vibhishana your brother would have had his
desire fulfilled. Rama would have been in the company of our allies. All of us would have been
spared the curse of widowhood and our enemies would not have realized their ambition."
"By you, however, who forcefully captivated Seetha cruelly, the demons, we (your
consorts) and your own self all the three have been destroyed all at once."
"O the excellent demon! Your act of following your own free will, may not be the
reason for your destruction, either for, all is being run by a divine power, struck and ruined by
the divine power."
"This destruction of the monkeys, your demons as also yourself, in the battle, has
happened at the juncture of the Providence (alone), O the great armed!"
"The course of destiny, when ready to bear fruit, cannot be diverted either by
money, or by wish, or by valour or even by command in this world."
Those consorts of Ravana, depressed as they were and afflicted with grief, with
their eyes full of tears, thus lamented like female ospreys.Anasuya having spoken thus, Seetha without any jealousy, full of reverence for her, addressed her gently as follows:
"It is not a surprise that a venerable woman like a you, talk to me like this, for, I know well that a husband is a respectable person for a woman."
"O, venerable woman! Even if my husband be without fortune, he should unhesitatingly be obeyed by me."
"How much more, if he be renowned for his virtues, compassionate, master of my
heart, who is ever affectionate, a religious person, manifests the tenderness of a mother and a father to me."
The exceedingly strong Rama bears himself to all other Queens, as he exercises his behaviour towards his mother, Kausalya."
"The valiant and pious Rama who is devoted to Dasartha and free from all sense of
importance treats all those women as his mothers on whom Dasaratha has even once bestowed a single glance."
"While departing for the lonely and fearful forest, my mother-in-law imparted a
great message to me, which I have inscribed in my heart."
"What my mother taught me when witnessed by the fire, earlier at the time of my
marriage with Rama, I shall always remember them."
"O, virtuous woman! By your words, all that is being renewed. No austerity, other
than obedience to one's husband is decreed for a woman."
Savitri* is now highly honoured in heaven, for having served her lord faithfully
heaven, You too, having followed this, will proceed to heaven, in showing obedience to your husband."
"This goddess Rohini, the excellent among all women, is not seen without the moon
even for a single moment in the sky."
"Such excellent women, devoted to their husbands, and by their meritorious deeds,
are highly honoured in heaven."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Anasuya was very much pleased, kissed on Seetha's
forehead and spoke delightfully (as follows)
"O, Seetha with a bright smile! There is a great merit acquired by me in virtue of my various pious observances. Through that power, I wish to confer a boon on you."
"O, Seetha! Your words are suitable for the occasion and are charming too. I am
satisfied. Tell me what good I may do for you."
Hearing those words of Anasuya, Seetha was surprised and with a gentle smile spoke to her, who was richly endowed with the power of askesis, saying; "Everything stands fulfilled (by your grace).
Thus spoken by Seetha, the pious-minded Anasuya became more delighted and said: "O, Seetha! Alas! I will create a great joy for you, which will be to your advantage."
"O, Seetha, the daughter of Videha kingdom! Here are divine gifts: a garland, an
apparel, jewels, a scented cosmetic and rare body-cream. These are all given by me to adorn your limbs. They will be ever worthy of your and will remain in tact (even after constant use)."
"O, Seetha! Your body, anointed with these heavenly cosmetics, will cause your
husband to look beautiful, as Lakshmi (the goddess of fortune and beauty) does the imperishable Vishnu (the Lord of Preservation)."
Seetha accepted the apparel, the scented cosmetic, the jewels and the garlands as
unsurpassed gifts of love.
Having accepted those gifts of love, the illustrious Seetha with joined palms, sat near that female ascetic.
To inquire about a lovely tale of once upon a time, Anasuya who was firm in
austerity, started asking the following words to Seetha who was sitting near her in that manner.
"O, Seetha! It is so said that you were won by the illustrious Rama through a
process of your self-choosing (svayamvara)*. This report has reached my ear."
"O, Seetha! I wish to hear that narrative in detail. Hence, tell me that tale in
full as you experienced it."
Then, Seetha obediently answered, saying "Hear me" and began to truly narrate that tale of Svayamvara to the virtuous woman, Anasuya."
"A king of Mithila kingdom, named Janaka who was valiant and a knower of
righteousness, was devoted to the duty of his warrior class and was ruling the earth in a fitting manner."
"While he was furrowing a territory of land, holding a plough in his hand, it is so said that I came forth, splitting up the land, as a daughter of that king."
"The king Janaka, who was absorbed in scattering handfuls of seeds was surprised to see me, with all my limbs covered with dust."
"Placing me personally in his lap with affection, that childless king Janaka called one as his daughter, and was very fond of me since then."
"It is said that voice resembling that of a human being in the air above me rang
out, saying": "O, King! Let it be so. This divine child without a match is a daughter to you, rightly."
"Thereafter, my father the pious mind the lord of men and the king of Mithila
kingdom was rejoiced in my possession and acquired extensive property."
"That king performing auspicious acts gave me into the care of the chief Queen. She nourished me fondly and with maternal affection."
"Seeing my age to be such, when union with a husband can be easily had, my father
fell a prey to anxiety like an indigent man, feeling miserable by the loss of all his possessions."
"Eventhough the father of an unmarried girl be like Indra himself on earth, suffers indignity in the world from the suitor's men, no matter whether they are equal or inferior to him."
"Perceiving that ill-treatment threatening him at no distant date, the king Janaka was plunged into an ocean of anxiety and did not reach its end any more than a man without a bark would reach the end of a sea."
"Knowing me to be the one not emerged from a mother's womb, the king after a deep
reflection, was unable to find a suitable and worthy husband for me."
"After reflecting thus deeply, the thought came to him, 'I shall inaugurate a
Svayamvara, a process of self-choosing marriage, for my daughter."
"In ancient days, Janaka received with affection from Varuna the rain-god, an
excellent bow with two quivers that should never lack arrows."
"That bow was so heavy in weight that no man could lift it up nor any of the kings were bale to bend it even in their dreams."
"My truthful father called all the princes first and informed them in a meeting
about the bow to be lifted."
"Whoever is able to lift up and string this bow, I will bestow my daughter in
marriage on him. There is no doubt about it."
"Seeing that excellent bow, resembling a mountain in weight, and being unable to
lift it up, the princes offered salutation to it and went away."
"After a very long time, this Rama born in Raghu dynasty with a great splendour
possessing a true valour, along with his brother Lakshmana together with a sage Visvamitra, came to witness a sacrifice."
"The pious-souled Visvamitra, having been received well by my father said to my
father, (as follows):
"These two boys, the sons of Dasaratha wish to see that bow. Show that bow, coming from gods, to Rama the prince."
"Hearing the words of Vivamitra, Janaka caused the bow to be brought there. The
mighty and the valiant Rama bent that bow merely within an instant and immediately stringed the bow with the bow-cord and drew the bow to the full."
"While Rama was drawing the bow to the full, the bow was broken into two in the
middle due to the resultant jerk. The terrific sound then created was like that of a falling thunderbolt."
"Then and there, my father true to his promise decided to bestow me on Rama,
offering him a jar of pure water."
"But Rama did not consent to accept my hand till the will of his father, the Lord
and the king of Ayodhya had been made known to him."
Thereupon, my father-in-law and the aged Dasaratha was invited to Mithila by my
father and with his approval, I was bestowed on Rama, the knower of the self."
"My younger sister Urmila, the virtuous lady of lovely looks was given as a consort to Lakshmana by my father himself."
"I was given thus to Rama in that Svayamvara, a process of self-choosing marriage. I became devoted, by my good works, to my husband who is excellent among men of strength."Then on comforting all of those vanara-s the highly diligent ones but overly tired
Angada slowly spoke this word to them. 
"We in oneness have searched there and thereabouts in the impassable forests,
mountains, and rivers, and unfathomable cavities and in mountain caves up to their end, but we have
not seen Janaki, so also that ill-natured demon, the abductor of Seetha, is not seen. [--,
]
"We started a long time back and a great deal of time is lapsed, and Sugreeva is a
severe disciplinarian, therefore let the search continue everywhere collectively. 
"Surrender not to sluggishness, submit not to sorrowfulness, slouch not to sleep, as
these lethargies are presently have come up against you. Let all of you search in such a way how
best we can find the daughter of Janaka, Seetha. 
"Insistency, ingenuity, and indomitability of heart are said to be the causes for
achieving results, therefore I am speaking all this. 
"Even now the forest dwellers can search this impenetrable forest, thus getting rid of
your rue and let all of this forest be searched in its entirety. 
"Fruit of pursuit will be evident for those who undertake an endeavor
earnestly, on the other hand, it will be unforgivable to shut our eyes deriving a high dejection.

"King Sugreeva is irascible and he is a ruthful persecutor too, oh, vanara-s, we
shall always be frightened of him, and of self-reliant Rama as well. 
"All this is being said in the interest of your well-being, and if it is obliging to
you it may be done in this way as I have said, if not, any other way out is there which will be
conducive for all of us, oh, vanara-s, it may be said." Thus Angada spoke to the troops of monkeys.

On hearing Angada's words, Gandhamaadana who is enervated with thirst and fatigue
spoke this sentence with inexplicit words. 
"What Angada has said that is indeed appropriate, isn't it? It is advantageous and
pragmatic also. Let us carry out as said by him. 
"Again let us search out mountains, caves, crags, also like that the uninhabited
forests and mountain rapids, too. 
"Let us all collectively search all of the places with forests, mountains, and gorges
as indicated by that self-assertive Sugreeva." Thus Gandhamaadana spoke to all monkeys.

Those great-mighty vanara-s again perking themselves up searched the southern
compass that is overspread with Vindhya forests. 
Those vanara-s who are the best among monkeys who are desirous of getting a glance
of Seetha have clambered up a magnificent Silver Mountain which in statuesque is like an autumnal
silvery cloud, which has many zeniths and caverns, and searched there in the delightful woods
of Lodhra trees, and even in the groves of seven-leaved banana plants. 
Though they searched everywhere on ascending the mountaintop they have not found
Seetha, the dear queen of Rama, and though they are immensely venturesome they are fatigued.

On searching what they could see all over that many caved mountains those
monkeys descended yet keeping an eye on all over that mountain. 
Then on climbing down the mountain they reached the ground and became tired and inane,
and staying there for the moment they took shelter at the base of a tree. 
They took respite for a moment and when their laboriousness intermitted a little,
again they ventured to search the southern direction in its entirety. 
Again making Mt. Vindhya the starting point of the search, those best fly-jumpers,
namely, Hanuma and the other chieftains of vanara-s, have searched all over the southern direction
for Seetha. Though Sampaati's voice is turned husky by his sadness for the demise of his brother
Jataayu, the monkey commander doubtingly disbelieved neither him nor even his words by the fact of
his being an eagle intending to kill and eat up all the monkeys. 
On seeing the eagle those fly-jumpers who sat for fast-unto-death have become
furious at the eagle thinking that, "that eagle wishes to eat up all of us..." Thus, the monkeys
deliberated the eagle's words. 
"We are sitting for fast-unto-death and if that eagle wishes eat us let it be so...
then our deliverance will be achieved in any way and we will go to heaven from here..." Thus, some
other monkeys gave thought to lowering that eagle down. 
When all of the monkey chiefs made up their mind in this way, then some of them wentto the mountaintop brought that eagle down, and then Angada spoke to the eagle. 
"Oh, bird, my noble grandfather is known as Rikshaja who was a valorous and an
outstanding monkey among all monkeys, was the king of monkeys. He has two generous and great mighty
sons namely Vali and Sugreeva. My father Vali was highly renowned in the world for his bold acts,
and he became the king later to my grandfather... 
"Among Ikshvaku-s, there is a great-charioteer, a king for the entire world, a
peerless person and he is the son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, and abiding by his father's
directives and opting for a righteous course of conduct, he moved into Dandaka forests along with his
brother Lakshmana and even with his wife Vaidehi... 
"Ravana forcibly abducted his wife from Janasthaana, namely Seetha, the princess
from Videha kingdom, and a kingly eagle named Jataayu, who is a friend of Rama's father Dasharatha,
has seen her while she was being abducted by Skyway. 
"Jatayu is overly tired when he made Ravana's chariot defective and withheld
Maithili from abduction as he is senescent, then Ravana killed him in that conflict... [--b,
c]
"Thus that eagle was killed by that mighty Ravana, but solemnized by the obsequies
performed by Rama, he departed on a sublime avenue to the heavens... 
"Then Raghava made friends with my paternal uncle Sugreeva, an intellectual
autocrat, and Sugreeva got my father killed. Since Sugreeva antagonized my father, my father
interdicted him along with his ministers, and Rama killed my father Vali and anointed Sugreeva...

"Rama enthroned Sugreeva as the ruler of all vanara-s and that king of all vanara
chiefs expedited all of us... 
"Though we are spearheaded by Rama and though we searched thereabouts for Vaidehi at
the behest of Sugreeva, as with a nightly sunshine Vaidehi is unattainable for us... 
"Such as we were we searched Dandaka forest very meticulously, but we unwittingly
entered into a wide-opened Black Hole of the earth... 
"During our search in that Black Hole, which was crafted by the wizardry of demon
Maya, the month fixed by our king for our return has been elapsed... 
"We who are all supposed to execute the order of our king, we have exceeded the
established norm of timeframe, and for fear of fury from our king Sugreeva we sat down for
fast-unto-death... 
"When Rama along with Lakshmana, and even Sugreeva will be infuriated by our
infringement of time, and even on our going to Kishkindha, as infringers there will be no survival
for all of us..." Thus Angada narrated their plight to Sampaati. Seeing Mahodara killed by Sugreeva, the mighty Mahaparsva for his part with his
red-blood eyes through anger, forthwith stirred up the terrific army of Angada with his arrows.
That demon struck down the heads of monkey-chiefs from their trunks, as wind would
throw down a fruit from its stalk.
Moreover, that demon very quickly chopped off the arms of some monkeys with his
arrows and struck down the region of the ribs of others.
Tormented by the flight of arrows of Mahaparshva, all those monkeys were downcast
with despair and lost heart.
Seeing his army depressed on being tormented by the demon, Angada who was endowed
with a great impetuosity, exhibited his tempo like an ocean on full-moon days.
Taking hold of a steel rod, with its radiance equal to that of the sun, hurled it on
Mahaparshva in that combat.
By that blow, that Mahaparsva dropped senseless and unconscious on the ground from
his chariot along with is charioteer
The energetic Jambavan, looking like a heap of black collyrium, who was exceedingly
powerful, battalion which resembled a black cloud a mountain-peak, killed his horses with his
strength and broke that chariot too.
Regaining his consciousness within a while, the mighty Mahaparshva again struck
Angada with his many arrows.
He struck Jambavan, the king of bears with three arrows in his chest and struck
Gavaksha too with many arrows.
Seeing Gavaksha and Jambavan tormented by the arrows, that Angada was infatuated
with anger and seized hold of a terrific iron rod.
Firmly holding that iron rod, which shone like the rays of the sun, with both hands
and turning it around with force, Angada son of Vali, his eyes red with anger, hurled it on that
Mahaparshva the demon, who stood at a distance, with an intention to kill him.
Hurled by the mighty Angada, that iron rod for its part, knocked the bow with the
arrow fitted to it, from the demon's hand and also his helmet.
Approaching him with speed and with anger, the valiant Angada slapped him on the
temple (root of the ear), shining with an ear-ring.
Enraged as he was, that Mahaparsva for his part, who was endowed with a great
swiftness and enormous splendour, seized hold of a huge axe in one hand.
Extremely enraged, the demon hurled that stainless and strong axe, which had been
washed in oil and which was made of steel, on Angada.
Full of anger, that Angada evaded that axe, which had been aimed by him mostly at
his left shoulder-bone.
That valiant Angada, with his prowess equal to that of his father, was quite enraged
and firmly tightened his fist resembling a thunder-bolt.
Knowing the vital parts of the body, Angada pounced his fist, which invaded like a
thunderbolt, on the boson of the demon, in the vicinity of his breasts.
With the blow of that fist in that great combat, the fleshy part of his heart was
blasted and he fell dead on the ground.
When Mahaparshva fell dead on the ground, his army got confused. A mammoth anger
arose in Ravana.
That highly profound lion's roar of the rejoiced monkeys, by its noise, was well
like the loud sound of the gods along with Indra the lord celestials, nay, by its vibrations
breaking asunder as it were the City of Lanka with its attics and town-gates.
Hearing the loud noise of monkeys, as also of the celestials in the battle-field,
the enraged Ravana the adversary of Indra, then stood prepared for a battle again.Then they saw an inexorable ocean, the realm of Rain-god, tumultuous with out-roaring and implacable waves, and 
shoreless otherwhere. 
Which month is set as the timeframe for the monkeys by King Sugreeva that month passed off while the monkeys were searching 
mountains, impassable areas, and within the cavity concocted by the wizardry of the demon Maya. 
Sitting on a foothill of Mt. Vindhya which is with fully flowered trees those virtue-souled monkeys are then driven 
in desperation. 
Then on seeing the treetops of spring season, weighty with flowers and enshrouded with hundreds of vines, they 
became incredulous with the fright of failing Sugreeva's timeframe. 
On discussing among themselves they found that spring season has arrived, and they also found the purpose of timely 
messaging about Seetha to Sugreeva is lost, thus they plumped down onto the surface of the earth. 
The crown prince and a great foreseer Angada, the monkey, whose nape of neck is leonine and bullish, arms lengthy 
and sturdy, then as usual paying respects to elderly monkeys greeted all of the forest dwellers and spoke this 
the sentence in a modest voice. 
"Oh, monkeys, we all have started at the command of the king of monkeys, and the month fixed by him is zeroed 
out while we were in Black Cavity. Are you aware of it?" Thus Angada started to speak his mind. 
"We were sent out scheduling time calculating from the month ofaashviiyujanearly 
October. Even that time fixed for us has also lapsed. Therefore, what is to be done next? 
"You are all the pioneers in the pathway of principles, you have notched up the credibility of your king, you are 
all well-disposed in the well-being of your king, and you are the contrivers of any exploit. 
"All of you are unparalleled in all tasks, all your asperity is renowned in all directions, and all of you have 
come impelled by that ochreish-eyed Sugreeva keeping me as your helmsman. 
"As of now our mission is incomplete hence we are scheduled to die, and there is no doubt about it. Who can be 
complacent by keeping the directive of the monkey's king incomplete? 
"But in this matter of course, as the time set by Sugreeva has lapsed, it is appropriate for all of us forest-dwelling 
monkeys to voluntarily undertake fasting unto death. 
"Instinctively Sugreeva is a tormentor and now he is institutionalized in lordship, thus he will not condone any 
of us as we will be as good as transgressors if we were to return. 
"Sugreeva sins alone in our respect by killing all of us as we failed in the facts about Seetha, therefore 
it is pertinent to enter upon fasting unto, leaving off our sons, wives, riches and houses and homes, too. [--, 
a]
"That king Sugreeva definitely and freakishly tortures all of us on our going back futilely, hence suicide at 
this place is justifiable for all of us. 
"I am not anointed to crown-princedom by Sugreeva, but I am anointed by the unbigoted Rama, the king of people. 

"That king Sugreeva who is already bound up in animosity with my father, and thus with me too, now on observing 
me transgressing his directive will decisively wish to liquidate me by tyrannous victimization. 
"Of what use is the witnessing of my kith and kin at me when I am tortured in the prime of my life, hence here 
on this sacred seashore alone I will outwait my death fasting unto it." Thus Angada said to all the monkeys. [--b, 
c]
On hearing all that uttered by that youngish Angada, the crown prince, all of those prominent Vanara-s sympathetically 
spoke these words. 
"Instinctively Sugreeva is a hot-tempered vanara and Raghava is interested in his beloved wife. The timeframe 
is lapsed and Vaidehi is unspotted. If we go back to Kishkindha now, on seeing us returning without completing 
our assignment, and with thinking to satisfy Rama Sugreeva's wishes to liquidate us without any doubt. [--, 
]
"It will be inexcusable for the culprits to pass at the sideways of lords, then where is the question of their 
coming into the king's audience, and we should be barefaced to return because we are all the chieftains of Sugreeva 
who are coordinated and sent here. 
"If we do not return to that champion Sugreeva on searching somewhere here for Seetha, or on our educating some 
information about her, we will rather enter the realm of Yama, the Terminator." Thus the other monkeys discussed 
among themselves. 
On hearing the words of fly-jumpers, who are tormented by the fear of Sugreeva, Lt. Tara spoke this to them, "enough 
is your desperation, if you all are interested let us enter that cave again where we can live. 
"That highly impassable cavity is contrived by the demon Maya and it is abundant with trees, water, eatables, and 
potables, and there is no fear even from Indra in that cavity, nor from Raghava, nor Sugreeva, the king of 
monkeys." So said Lt. Tara to all. 
On hearing Angada's words, as well as the words of Lt. Tara that are trended to Angada's words, all the monkeys 
compliantly spoke with believability, "in which way we all will not be killed that way may be waymarked, and promptly 
make it happen now only." So said all the monkeys to Angada. That mighty Kumbhakarna, with his colossal body resembling the peak of a mountain,
having crossed the rampart, sallied forth from the city.
Kumbhakarna emitted a roar, making the sea to reverberate, causing the mountains to
quake and drowning the thunder-claps, as it were.
Seeing that demons of terrific eyes who could not be destroyed either by Indra the
lord of celestials or by Yama the lord of death or by Varuna the god of water, the monkeys ran
away.
Seeing them running away, Angada the prince spoke to Nala, Neela, Gavaksha and the
mighty Kumuda as follows:
"Where do you go, forgetting your own dignities as also nobilities of birth and
trembling with fear like common monkeys?"
"O auspicious monkeys! Please return! Why do you so fully guard your lives? This
demon is not competent for a combat. He is merely a great toy of terror."
"O monkeys! By our prowess, we shall destroy this giant toy produced by demons. Come
back!"
Reconciling themselves with some difficulty, the monkeys, from all sides, assembled
together at a place and snatching some trees, the monkeys for their part, towards the
battle-field.
Like elephants in rut, those monkeys, having came back, hurriedly hit Kumbhakarna,
very much enraged as they were.
The mighty Kumbhakarna, though assaulted with lofty mountain-tops, rocks and trees
with blossoms at their ends, stood unshaken.
Many rocks, fallen on his limbs, got burst into pieces. The trees, with blossoms at
their ends, were broken and fell shattered on the floor.
Kumbhakarna too, very much enraged, crushed the ranks of monkeys though they were
greatly energetic, with his extreme exertion even as a rising fire would consume the woods.
Many of the foremost among the monkeys lay on the ground, bathed in blood as they
were, fallen like trees with crimson flowers, when tossed up by the demon.
Some monkeys, while jumping and running away, did not look back. Some fell in the
ocean. Some inhabited the sky.
While that demon was killing some warriors of monkeys playfully, some others ran
away by the same route, by which they earlier crossed the ocean.
While some monkeys becoming pale-faced due to fear, inhabited the mounds and the low
grounds, some bears ascended the trees. Some escaped to a hill.
Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some others
escaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as though
they were dead.
Seeing those monkeys disorderly retreated, Angada spoke these words, "Stay. We shall
carry on the battle. Come back."
"I do not catch sight of any place for you, who have retreated, even if you roam
over the entire earth. Let all of you come back. Why do you safeguard your lives?"
"O valiant monkeys, moving without hindrances! Your wives, seeing you running away
leaving your weapos aside, will mock at you. It is indeed a death for those who lived well."
"All of us are born in distinguished races; which are well developed. Where to you
go frightened, like ordinary monkeys? As you are running away with fear, leaving all your valour,
you are indeed unworthy of honour."
"Where did those boasting words of you melt away, in which you highly projected
yourself in front of the people just before coming for the battle?
"The cowards, who survive even after being reproached, have to hear slanders from
the people. Let the path trodden by the good people be followed. Let your fear be abandoned."
"If our longevity is short, we shall lie down, being killed by the enemies, on the
earth and reach the realm of Brahma (residence of pious spirits), which is difficult to be attained
by bad warriors."
"O monkeys! We shall obtain glory by killing our enemies in battle or if killed on
the other hand, we shall enjoy the heaven, attained by the warriors."
"Coming face to face with Rama, Kumbhakarna will not go back alive, any more than a
moth meeting a blazing fire."
"If we, in large numbers, who are intended to fight, are conquered by one person
alone and if we protect our lives by running away, our glory will undergo a damage."
Then, those fleeing monkeys spoke the following words, which were contemptible by
the warriors, to that valiant Angada, who was adorneed with golden armlets.
"For us, it is enough of this terrific battle with Kumbhakarna, the demon. It is not
the proper time to stay back but it is to time to go away. Life is indeed dear to us."
Seeing that terrific Kumbhakarna coming with his dreadful eyes, all those commanders
of monkey-troops, speaking words only thus far, scattered in all directions.
Thereafter, with the coaxing words and inferential arguments by Angada, all those
fleeing commanders of monkeys turned back.
Having been cheered up by the intellectual Angada, all those commanders of the
army-troops stood awaiting his command.
Rishabha, Sharabha, Mainda, Dhumra, Neela, Kumuda, sushena, Gavaksha, Rambha, Tara
and more particularly Dvipada, Panasa and hanuma marched ahead very quickly, with their faces
turned towards the battle.On Sage Sharabhanga attaining heaven, groups of sages assembled and approached
  Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, who is glowing with resplendence. 
The sages called Vaikahanasa-s,  also Vaalakhilyaa-s,  and those from the
  water of His feet-wash, and those that thrive on drinking rays of sun and moon alone, and those
  that pound with stones and others who thrive on leaves alone, are those sages... 
Some of them use their own teeth to grid the grain they eat, and some who perform
  ascesis in neck-deep water, and some who sleep with their head resting on their shoulders or on
  chests without using any kind of bed, and some who do not use any kind of beds either, and some
  who meditate without any repose sitting in an enclosure without any leg-space. 
And some sages whose food is water alone, or air alone to some, like that some who
  meditate staying in sky and some who sleep on bare ground itself. 
Thus some are dwellers on high-peaked places with their senses controlled, and
  some are wearers of wet cloths, always reciting name or hymn japa and like that some who meditate
  with five kinds of fire around them. 
All have Vedic resplendence and firm yogic control, and they have arrived at the
  hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga for Rama. 
Those virtuous sages coming together in groups neared Rama, the best beholder of
  virtue, and said to that supreme one in virtue. 
"You are the supreme charioteer born in Ikshvaku dynasty hence you are the
  protector of earth under your control. As with Indra, the ruler of divinities you are a similar
  ruler for us. 
Though born in Ikshvaku dynasty you are the Supreme Charioteer, hence you are the
  same Supreme Charioteer of this Earth and earthlings too, as with Indra who protects divinities,
  you are our protector.
"You are well renowned in all the three worlds by your repute and valour, and in
  you abounding are the virtues like truthfulness and devotion to your father, and even
  righteousness too, is there. 
"You are the great-souled one, knower of righteousness and a patron of virtue...
  such as you are, on approaching you we beg to state something for which we may please be
  excused... 
"Oh! , very great a-dharma, wrongness, will occur to that king who takes the sixth
  part of the country's produce as cess, but does not safeguard his subjects like his own sons...
  
"A king shall treat all the subjects of kingdom as his own sons, and he shall
  protect them as though he is ready to save them at the cost of his own lives, and he who will
  always be endeavouring in that manner will attain permanent renown lasting for many for many
  years to come, and thereby he attains a prosperous place even in Brahma's abode... 
"He who righteously protects his subjects will get one fourth of the merit of
  great duty-bound deeds performed by each individual sage, say yajna-s, ascesis, meditation etc.
  performances. 
"O, Rama, though you are there as protector for the hermitages, suchlike this one,
  where the most reverent Brahmans are there numerously, they look as though forsaken, for they are
  being demolished by demons, devastatingly... 
"Come and see many of the bodies of the sages, the contemplative souls, that are
  variously killed by ghastly demons in the forest... 
"At Pampa riverside, and alongside of River Mandakini, and at the surroundings of
  Mt. Chitrakuta also, this hideous warfare is being done... 
"Thus. we are not able to tolerate this injustice to the sages, being executed in
  this forest by the demons with fiendish deeds, in a ghastly manner... 
"Therefore we present ourselves before you as you are our protector, for the
  purpose of your protecting us that are being killed by nightwalkers... please safe guard us...
  
"Other than you, oh, valorous Rama, no way-out is deducible on this earth, hence
  oh, prince, protect all of us from the demons... 
On hearing all that is said by the sages of great penance, he that virtue souled
  Rama said this unto all of the sages. 
"Unapt is this way of speaking to me...command me, for I am at your behest... just
  for my personal purpose I had to enter the forests.... 
"I entered this forest as ordered by my father and even to obliterate the
  unconscionable state of yours owing to the misdeeds of demons. 
"Perchance I have come for the achievement of your purpose, such as I am, dwelling
  in this forest will immensely be fruitful to me... 
"I wish to eliminate demons, the enemies of sages, in war... let the sages behold
  my valour, and my brother's valour in doing so..." Thus Rama promised the sages. 
Thus giving his aegis to the sages, that valiant Rama who is firmly virtue-souled,
  journeyed towards Sage Suteekshna with Lakshmana and the sages, and along with the one given by
  Honourable Janaka, namely Seetha. King Dasharatha requests Sage Vashishta, the Royal Priest to commence works for the Vedic 
ritual. Sage Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline to be observed in 
executing the works. Sage Vashishta also instructs the minister Sumantra to invite various 
kings of other countries, and those kings will be received with great hospitality. King Dasharatha 
along with his wives takes ritual vow and enters ritual hall.
On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined 
one to beget progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall. 
Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble 
words to him. 
"Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such 
a way that no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions. 
"You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly and kind-hearted to me, and you alone 
shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good faith and credence. 
Then that reverent Brahman Vashishta said to king, "Whatever that is requested or decided 
by you, I will see that all of them are materialised accordingly. 
Then Sage Vashishta then summoned and spoke to elderly Brahman scholars, and elderly architects 
who are all proficient and elderly experts in conducting the construction of the ritual hall 
etc. Then summoned are the construction supervisors, brick-makers, carpenters, earth-diggers, 
accountants, and sculptors. So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars 
in scriptures and those men who are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them 
saying, "Performance of the ritual be organised by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands 
be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, 
with very many facilities included in them. 
"Like that, for accommodating Brahmans hundreds of sanctified houses be built, well endowed 
and well established with very many eatables, foods, and potables. 
"So also, accommodation is to be given for city dwellers too, in very spacious housing, and 
severally for the kings arriving from distant places.
"For horses stables, reposing stalls for elephants, like that great billets for soldiers may 
be built for those foreign-country dwellers arriving in here on their horses and elephants 
along with their soldiers. 
"These lodgings are to be arranged with many foods and utilities for the people of this city 
and for others coming from distant countries, and a very grand food be given in all of them. 

"Food is to be given dutifully treating all of them well but not just illusively, and the 
people of all the castes shall be well honoured as they would get their due respect, and no 
disrespect be shown, even when overcome by passion or anger at anyone. 
"Exceptionally respectable are those men and architects that are preoccupied in the works 
of the ritual as they deserve, and those men involved in these works shall be well-treated 
with funds and food. 
"Thus, as to how all this be well organised without least negligence, thus you all shall administer 
in all your cooperation and good spirit." Thus Sage Vashishta spoke to the organisers. 
Then all of them collectively replied to Sage Vashishta "As desired, all the well ordered 
works will not be neglected in the least, and they will be done as ordered, and not the least 
of them will be slighted." So said the artisans to Sage Vashishta. 
"Then on calling for Sumantra, Sage Vashishta said these words to him, "Let all those kings 
of the earth that are righteous be invited, and let all the people from all the kingdoms, 
say Brahmans, Kshatriya-s, Vaisya-s, Shudra-s be invited in scores duly honouring them." So 
said Vashishta to Sumantra. 
"You personally invite Janaka the king of Mithila, a valiant one and an advocate of truth, 
honouring his well and duly bearing in mind that he is a long-time associate of our King Dasharatha, 
hence I am telling you in the first instance. 
"Thus that King of Kaashi who is always a friendly, affectionate and a cordial one, indeed 
he shall be invited by you personally. 
"Likewise, King of Kekaya, an elderly, very virtuous, and also the father-in-law of our Lion-King 
Dasharatha, you personally invite him along with his sons. 
"Romapada, the lord of Anga kingdom and the user of great bow, let that illustrious one be 
invited well honoured, for he is the friend of our lion-king Dasharatha. 
"Like that King of Kosala namely Bhanumanta, and the King of Magadha, a brave one and a profound 
one in all scriptural knowledge, let them be honoured well and be invited. 
"And Praaptijna, the king of Magadha, the kind-hearted and best one among kings, be well honoured 
and invited. Further, taking the orders of King Dasharatha and motivated by those orders, 
the kings of Sindhu, Sauviira and Sauraastra kingdoms may also be invited. 
"All of the kings of southern kingdoms be invited, and should there be any other friends and 
other friendly kings on the surface of the earth, they too shall be invited as early as possible 
with all their followers, relatives through highly illustrious envoys, of course with the 
orders of our king." Thus Sage Vashishta said to minister Sumantra. 
On hearing that word of Vashishta, Sumantra expeditiously ordered devout envoys to invite 
all those kings to their kingdom. 
That virtuous Sumantra became brisk upon sage's words and personally journeyed to fetch all 
the rulers on the earth. 
All those artisans engaged in ritual works have reported Vashishta, the details of all those 
ritual works that are accomplished. 
Then, that satisfied saint and eminent Brahman Vashishta, spoke this way to all of them, "nothing 
is to be endowed to anyone either with disrespect or deceptively, the deeds done with disrespect 
will kill the donor and there is no doubt about it." 
Then in some days and nights many kings have arrived taking precious gems with them as gifts 
for Dasharatha. 
Then the well pleased Sage Vashishta said this to King Dasharatha "the kings from distant 
kingdoms have arrived at your behest, oh, tigerly-man, and these best kings are well honoured 
by me also as per their status. 
"All the ritual works are also completed by the well coalescent men, thus you may start towards 
the ritual place that is nearby, to perform your ritual." Said Sage Vashishta to King Dasharatha. 

"All the desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt 
of you see ritual hall that is as though built by your mere wish. 
Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth 
towards the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa. 

Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them 
entered the ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus. 
When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha 
along with his wives undertook vow of ritual. The Horse Ritual of Emperor Dasharatha is started on the banks of Sarayu River. The details 
of the arrangements for the participants, and visitors along with some aspects of the Vedic 
Ritual are narrated.
Then after completion of one year and on regaining the ritual horse, the Emperor Dasharatha 
commenced his Vedic Ritual on the northern banks of River Sarayu. 
Keeping Rishyasringa at the helm of affairs those eminent Brahmans commenced,ashva-medha, the Horse-ritual of that noble-souled Dasharatha. 
Those well-versed conductors of Vedic rituals calledritviks, have started to perform 
works relating to ritual as per canon and rules, and conducted them scripturally and customarily. 

On performingpravargyaritual as per scriptures, like thatupasadaritual 
too, those Brahmans have customarily performed all of those other rituals incidental to the 
main one scripturally. 
Then all of those distinguished sages are contended with what they have performed by worshipping 
gods already summoned, they also conducted early morningsavanaritual and its ancillaries 
as enjoined. 
The oblations addressed to Indra are well given as ordained, and the flawless king Dasharatha 
also crushed the Soma creeper to squeeze Soma juice, and thus the mid-daysavanaritual has come to pass according to sequence. 
Like that those proficient Brahmans have also performed the thirdsavana, ritual 
of that great-exalted soul Dasharatha according to the viewpoint of scriptures. 
Rishyasringa and other best scholars with their well lettered and intonated Vedic hymns have 
invoked Indra and other gods to that place. 
Thehotaa-s, invocators, have welcomed the celestials for partaking oblations by 
singingsaamaVeda hymns sweetly and harmoniously, and on inviting them with Vedic 
hymns they have offered oblations to them. 
There is no unburnt oblation resulted in that fire-ritual nor even a small mishap slipped 
in the performance of ritual. Everything appeared canonically correct and hymn oriented. Indeed 
the ritual is performed in a secure way. 
In these days of ritual none found there to be weary or hungry, and there is no single unscholarly 
person, nor any Brahman without at least a hundred apprentices. 
Given anytime the Brahmans, servants, sages, and pilgrims are fed with food for their arrival 
at the place of boarding is unpredictable, and that arrival is dependent on their duties for 
Brahmans, and by their masters for servants, and for pilgrims that do not have a particular 
time of arrival or departure. 
Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, no satisfaction 
to complete the meal is attained for themselves, as the food served is that pleasant.
Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, there is no satisfaction 
to Emperor Dasharatha, for it appeared to be too meagre a serving and a lot more is to be 
served. 
"Food be given abundantly, clothing be given variously" are the directives, accordingly the 
king's men have distributed numerously there at the ritual place. 
Heaps of foodstuffs are also appearing there, many of them and mountain similar, which is 
made available customarily, day after day. 
To that ritual of that great-souled Dasharatha masses of men and women have arrived from different 
countries, and they are all well-pleased with the sumptuous food and drink supplied. 
"The eminent Brahmans have appreciated the food that is prepared by perfect cooking to be 
relishable, and it is heard as they said, "oh, Raghava, blessed are you for we are satisfied..." 

Well-decorated men have served food to Brahmans, while others who wore gem-studded and lustrous 
earrings have helped them. 
Those eminent Brahmans that are good debaters have debated many intellectual debates to defeat 
each other, during the gap-periods of ritual works. 
Day by day those expert Brahmans have performed all ritual works as encouraged by Vashishta, 
and others and as contained in scriptures. 
There is no scholar without the knowledge of the six branches of Vedas, none who is an unavowed 
scholar, none who heard learnt less scriptures, and none among the members of the ritual of 
that king Dasharatha is an inexpert in debating, thus all are scholarly Brahmans. 
When the time came to stake wooden ritual posts, six posts of bilwa wood, six posts of khadira 
wood, and further the same number of posts of parnina wood are staked. One post of sleshmaataka 
wood and two of devadaaru wood as stipulated are staked. Then the distance between each post 
is maintained at the length of extended arms. 
All of those the posts are made by the authorities on scriptures and ritual scholars, and 
they are gold-pleated and decorated for the purpose of elegance to that ritual. 
They are altogether twenty-one posts, each post is twenty-one cubits in height, and each is 
decoratively clothed with each cloth. 
Carpenters have carved all the posts well, and built them strongly with octahedral surfaces 
that are smoothened, and thereby they are implanted procedurally. 
Those posts draped in cloths and worshipped with flowers and perfumery are irradiant, and 
they shone forth like the constellation of Seven Sages in the sky. 
The bricks for Altar of Fire are well designed and made according to rules and standard measurements. 
The Brahmans who are experts in the architecture of laying Fire Altar, by calculating the 
ritual field with a one-ply rope and decide where and how the that shall be, the Altar of 
Fire is layered well with bricks in that ritual. 
That Altar of Fire of that King, the Lion, is layered by expert Brahmans in the shape of an 
eagle with golden wings, with its size being three folds bigger than the altars of other rituals, 
thus it has eighteen separators, and fire is laid on it. 
In that ritual animals, serpents and birds designated to such and such deities are readied 
according to the scriptural directives. 
The sages have arranged those animals that are to be there in animal sacrifices, like horse 
and other aquatic animals, in that ritual according to scriptures. 
Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse 
of that King Dasharatha. 
With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, 
and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. 
Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse 
that flew away like a bird. 
Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namelyhotaaadhwaryuandudgaataahave received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the 
king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king. 
Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum 
 of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to 
bake as a food to the celestials. 
The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own 
sin. 
Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally 
oblated all of them into fire. 
In other rituals the oblations will be offered into sacrificial fire with spoon-like sticks 
of plaksha tree, but in Horse-sacrifice ritual they are offered through the vetasa creeper, 
a rattan plant, cane. 
The Horse Ritual is to be performed for three days as laid down inkalpasutra-s, 
the rules governing such rituals, and bybraahmaNa-s, the penultimate parts of Veda-s, 
and the one performed on the first day is calledchatuSTomaritual. 
The ritual on the second day is calledukthyam, and the next one performed on third 
day is calledatiraatra. These apart many of the preordained rituals are performed 
there in that ritual as envisaged in scriptures. 
The rituals calledjyothiSToma, aayuSi,andatiraatrarituals are performed. 
And also rituals of great kind likeabhijit, vishwajit, aptoryaamaare performed. 

As the promoter of his own dynasty that king Dasharatha donated eastern side tohotaa, 
western toadhvaryu, and southern tobrahmaa. And toudgaataanorthern 
side is given in donation. These were the donations stipulated in that great ritual,ashwamedha, 
by the Self-Created Brahma from earlier times. 
On completing the ritual thus that best man Dasharatha justifiably donated those lands to 
the officiating priests, called ritwiks, to promote his dynasty. 
Thus on giving away the vast expanses of his kingdom he that glorious one born in Ikshvaku 
dynasty is gladdened, but all the officiating priests said to the king who by now is rid of 
his sins. 
"You alone are capable to protect the earth in its entirety, and there is no use for us with 
these lands, and we are not capable to rule it, either." Thus the priests are addressing the 
king. 
"We are always preoccupied with self-study and teaching of scriptures, oh, king, thus you 
may give us something else in barter, any modest thing. " 
"Let best gems, gold, or cows or anything else that is available you may give us, what is 
the use of these vast expanses to us." So said the scholars. 
The king Dasharatha, the lord of people, thus requested by the scholarly Vedic Brahmans gave 
them millions of cows, ten of ten million gold coins, and the silver four times thereof. 
Then all those officiating priests collectively gave that wealth to sage Rishyasringa and 
to the enlightened sage Vashishta. 
Then all of those Brahmans are well satisfied at heart and distributed among themselves the 
wealth passed on by Rishyasringa and Vashishta, and then they said, "We are highly gladdened." 

Then to the other Brahmans who arrived there to see the ritual, King Dasharatha sincerly donated 
ten million gold coins. 
That descendent of Raghava dynasty gave an excellent hand ornament to someone who is an impoverished 
Brahman and who is beseeching. 
While those Brahmans are becoming happy then that king and the patron of Brahmans venerated 
them dutifully with his senses fluttering with happiness. 
Then that benevolent and valiant King Dasharatha prostrated on ground venerating the Brahmans, 
and the Brahmans too chanted various blessing hymns on that prostrating king. 
Then that king is gladdened at heart for the successful achievement of the completion of that 
excellent ritual that removes sin and that leads to heaven as well, and that which cannot 
be undertaken by many of the best kings. 
Thereafter king Dasharatha said to sage Rishyasringa thus, "oh, sage with best vows, you alone 
are eligible to perform the ritual for the expansion of my dynasty." 
That best Brahman Rishyasringa saying yes to the proposal, said this to king Dasharatha, "oh, 
king, there will be four sons to you that ennoble your dynasty. 
On hearing the sweet words of Sage Rishyasringa, he that king of kings Dasharatha went into 
a state of ecstasy and venerating that great soul, Rishyasringa, again said this to him. A word about this chapter. Readers acquainted with a critical version of the Ramayana may find some verses in this chapter that are unknown to them. They occur in all the other traditional versions and carry the blemish of interpolation. They are inescapable in traditional versions, as age-old commentators have long commented on them. On Sugreeva's entering the cave-like Kishkindha, Rama who spent rainy nights on that mountain with much distress owing to the misery of yearning for Seetha has seen the immaculate sphere of the moon on silvern sky freed by ceasing rains, and even autumnal nights that are enamelled with moonshine, and thus he observed that Seetha is lost hopelessly, engrossed in lust Sugreeva is lost to the world intractably, and time to is being lost irretrievably, and thus he became highly impatient and even swooned. But on getting consciousness in a moment, that thoughtful king Raghava started to think of Vaidehi who was abiding in his heart, though not at his side. On seeing the sky to be spic and span when set free of black clouds and lightning, and even vibrant with the shrieks of Saarasa birds, Rama bemoaned in woeful words. Rama's concepts are on the rove towards his ladylove when he beheld the skyscape of autumn while sitting on the summit of a mountain that is embellished with gold and other ores, and he soliloquised his thoughts in this way. "Young Seetha with a voice that is a soundalike to the callings of Saarasa birds used to take delight in these resonant calls of Saarasa birds when we were together in hermitage, but how she might be taking delight in these chirrups now without me. "On seeing the flawless Asana trees flowered as if with golden flowers, she checks up for my availability thereabout, but now finding me nowhere near her, how can she be happy? "She who is enchanting to me by her well-proportioned limbs that clucky-voiced Seetha earlier used to wake me up in tune with the musical callings of clucking swans, but how that ladylove of mine might be amusing herself now. "On hearing the sharp notes of Cakravaka birds that always move together in couples, what will become of this white-lotus-like broad-eyed Seetha, since she is not together with me? "I am not able to enjoy myself without that deer-eyed lady though wandering around enjoyable lakes, rivers, tanks, forests and woodlands, whose thirst is drenched by rainwater and my thirsting for her is not. "The Love-god with a plethora of provocative autumnal features will be prolongedly agonising her because she is separated from me, and because her ladyship is a frailty - won't he?" Thus Rama worried for Seetha. So on and so forth that best one among men and the son of a king keened over, like a Rain-cuckoo which will be keen on Indra, the king of divinities, for rainy water. Meandering on the pleasant mountain terraces in search of fruits brilliant Lakshmana returned and has seen his elder brother Rama. Noble-hearted Saumitri, on observing lone Rama in a lonely place, who is beset with unbearable sadness and whose posture is vacuous became very miserable because of the sad condition of his brother and spoke to Rama fretfully. "Oh, noble one, what is the use in getting into fetters of passion, what for soul's bold temper is being trounced, this remorseful sadness is arrogating self-assurance, and what purpose can be achieved now in retracing steps from the goal? "Oh, dear sir, engage yourself in your mission with an undeterred spirit and with a good disposition of mind, and bring time under control with steadfastness and ideation, and the capabilities of your helpmates, say Sugreeva and others be gathered, and the basis for your achievements, say daily rituals towards gods, be performed by you as your means. "Oh, the lord of human kindred, with you as her husband Janaki is not an easily attainable one for others, oh, highly honourable one, if it is said that none will be burnt if he nears the tongues of flaming fire, oh, brave one, it is not so, for Janaki is a flaming fire, and anyone nearing her in ill-will will be burnt to ashes like a grasshopper." Thus Lakshmana said to Rama. Lakshmana with his seemliness spoke those undeniable and expedient words that emerged from his very nature, which is tasteful, morally abiding, and further abounding with friendliness, righteousness, and meaningfulness, and on listening such words Rama spoke to Lakshmana. Rama spoke to seemly and undeniable Lakshmana with words that emerged from his very nature, which are tasteful, morally abiding, and further abounding with friendliness, righteousness, and meaningfulness. "Doubtless accomplishment of the task is to be held in view, even oh, boy, the factors that contribute to its accomplishment, like enthusiasm, helpmates etc., are to be followed through, and not only these aspects but we also have to observe the fruition of task when that task is becoming unwieldy, unattainable and formidable, along with the lapse of time and lapsing of help." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. On thinking about the fruit of his mammoth task, namely that lotus-petal-eyed Maithili, thereafter Rama spoke to Lakshmana with a dried-up face. "On satisfying Mother Earth with rainwater and on effectuating the crops on earth, the Thousand-eyed Indra is complacent as his task is effectuated, whereas my task is yet to take off. "Clouds roving on the tops of mountains and trees with their protracted and profound peals have let the water loose and they are now retired, oh, prince, but tireless are rumbles and grumbles in my heart, thus I cannot retire. "On blackening ten quarters of earth blue-black clouds that looked like petals of blue-lotuses are now quietened in their nimbleness like rut-less elephants. "Now pausing are the high-speeded rainy winds, which once speedily swooped with water in their wombs, and wafted the fragrance of Kutaja and Arjuna flowers. "The rales of clouds, elephants, peacocks, and oh, merited Lakshmana, of the freshets too, are suddenly quietened. "Scoured well by rains from colossal clouds those amusing mountain terraces are grime-less and they shine forth as though enamelled with the moonbeams. "Presently autumn has shown itself dividing its charm into the branches of seven-leaved banana plants, on the stars, sun and moon, and also on those best elephants that are rollicking. "Fascinatingly glistening grandeur of autumn that is derived from the merits of the season and that resorts to many objects of the season are now splendidly shining in the lotus lakes that are flourished by the rays of the dawning sun. "Then desiring both of our well-being I have begged of my brother who is enveloped
in anger and behaving capriciously. 
"Oh, orphans, delight Rama, I addressed him like this, "Luckily you have eliminated
the enemy and returned safely, and to an orphaned one like me, you alone are the protector.

Let this regal umbrella unfold like a full moon, with many of its spikes, and
accompanying fur fans please be accepted while I hold it for you. 
"Saddened I was after staying at the entrance of the cave for one year, oh, king,
and on seeing the blood that started to flow from out of the cave in the entrance my heart was engulfed
in sadness and my senses perturbed very much, and then covering that cave's entrance with a
hilltop, and departing from that country, I re-entered Kishkindha.
"On seeing me returning with grief, the citizens and ministers alike crowned me, but
that is not at my desire, therefore it is apt of you to pardon me. 
"As an estimable one, you alone are the king, and I will be as I was, and
establishing me in kingship is owing to your unavailability, but the capital with citizens and
ministers are kept up without thorniness. 
"Oh, gentle one, I am now returning this custodial kingdom to you, oh, enemy
eliminator, you need not be hostile towards me. 
"I beg you with my bowed head and with my prayerful palm fold, the ministers and the
City dwellers have collectively and forcibly nominated me to the kingship, only to keep the
kingless kingdom under control. 
"While I was speaking that politely he threatened me and indeed used many expletives
starting from 'fie, fie, upon you.' and the like. 
"And summoning people and venerable ministers he hurled very abusive words at me
among friends. 
"You all are aware that earlier the gigantic and rancorous demon Maayaavi invited me
desiring a duel on that night. 
"On hearing his call for a duel I went out of the royal palace, and this very
hazardous brother of mine quickly followed me. 
"And that formidable demon Maayaavi ran away as he was fraught with fear on seeing
me with a second one at my side, and he speedily entered a great cavity of earth on seeing us two
nearly reaching him. 
"On knowing the demon's entry into that great precarious cavity, I said to this one,
this cruel-looking brother of mine.
"My power will not let me return from here to the capital without killing that
demon, hence you wait at this cavity's entrance, till I kill that demon and come out of the cavity.

"Believing that he stayed at the entrance of the cavity I entered that impenetrable
cavity, and then in searching for that demon there one year elapsed. 
"I have seen that terrified enemy of mine effortlessly, and I killed him immediately
along with all of his relatives. 
"That cavity has become impassable since it is filled with the gushes of
blood emanating from the mouth of that demon who fell yelling onto the ground. 
"On my killing that invading enemy easily, I could not see any exit from that cavity
as its mouth was closed. 
"Wherefore I did not get a reply though I repeatedly shouted, 'Sugreeva, oh,
Sugreeva.' thereby I was very saddened. 
"With my foot, I pounded and smashed that lidded hilltop, and from there I exited
that way and arrived here.
"As such this cruel fantasist of kingdom trammeled me in there forgetting the
clannishness." So said Vali to all the courtiers. 
"On saying thus that monkey ruthlessly banished me, then and there in the court
itself, who am with a single clothing on my body. 
"Thus he threw me away and even stole my wife, oh, Rama, and owing to his fear alone
I roamed all over the earth with its forests and oceans. 
"I who am saddened by stealing my wife have entered this safest mountain Rishyamuka,
which is impenetrable for Vali for another reason. 
"All this notable account of enmity is reported to you, oh, Raghava, and you may
examine the dire straits befallen on me at no fault of mine. 
"Oh, Rama, the fear-remover of all the worlds, it is apt of you to bestow me
invulnerability from the fear of Vali, and oh, valiant one, as well as to rein him in." Sugreeva
requested Rama thus. 
When he is requested thus by Sugreeva, that virtuous and resplendent Rama starts to
tell Sugreeva, the words that abide by virtue, as though trivializing the task at hand.

"Admirable and sun-like burners are these arrows of mine that are now mingled with
my wrath and they are bound to fall on that evil-minded Vali. 
"He that stealer of your wife, that evil-minded abuser of history lives as long as I
describe. 
"By my experience, I see how you are deluged in a sea of sadness, but I will make you
get over that sea, and you will regain abundantly whatever you lost," Rama assured
Sugreeva thus. 
Hearing that sentence of Rama, which is enhancing happiness and self-esteem,
Sugreeva is very gladdened and further said this great sentence. Seeing he had resolved to halt at that place for the night, the sage Bharadwaja
prepared to offer Bharata the son of Kaikeyi the full honours due to a guest
Then, Bharata said to Bharadwaja as follows: "Have you not presented me with water to wash my hands and feet and offered me this hospitality fitting for a guest in this forest?"
Then, Bharadwaja smilingly replied to Bharata as follows: "I know you possess a
friendly disposition and you are pleased with whatever is offered to you."
"O, Bharata the excellent among men! I wish to offer food to your army. You ought to fulfil my satisfaction in every suitable way."
"O, warrior! Why did you come here, leaving your army at a distance? Why did you notcome to my place with your army?"
Bharata, with joined palms, replied to Bharadwaja who was rich with austerity in the following words: "O, venerable one! I have not come here with my army for the fear of displeasing you."
"O, Venerable One! Either the king or the prince should always keep away from the
places occupied by ascetics"
"O, Holy one! Spirited horses, men and rare elephants in rut covering an immense
area are accompanying me."
"Let them not damage the trees, huts and ground and defile the waters of hermitages' - in this thought, I came alone."
Thereafter Bharata, having been commanded by that great sage to bring the army
there, allowed the army's arrival to the hermitage.
Meanwhile, entering the fire-sanctuary (the place where the sacrificial fire is
kept), sipping water and wiping the lips, Bharadwaja invoked Visvakarma (the architect of gods) in order to fulfil his duties towards the guests (as follows)
"I wish to offer hospitality to the guest I summon vishvakarma who is also the
divine carpenter. Let arrangements be made in that connection for me."
"I further invoke the three gods (Yama, Varuna and Kubera) the guardians of the
worlds with Indra as their king. I wish to offer hospitality to the guests. Let arrangements be made in this connection for me."
"Let the rivers which flow towards the east and those which flow towards the west, across the earth and in the aerial region now come together here from all quarters."
"Let some rivers flow with Maireya ( a kind of wine made from date palms etc) some others flow with highly refined spirituous liquor and some others flow with cool water with a taste of sugarcane."
"I invoke the celestials and celestial musicians Vishvavasu, Haha and Huhu as also Apsaras (nymphs) belonging to the celestial and celestial musicians' race from all regions.
"I invoke the celestial nymphs called ghritachi, Vishvachi, Mishra Kesi, Alambusa, Nagadanta and Hema as also Hima who has an abode made in mountains."
"I invoke the fair women who are attending on Brahma the Lord of creation - all of them with their external appendages (like musical instruments) along with (their teacher) Tumburu."
"Let that beautiful garden in the region of northern Kuru, presided over by Kubera (the god of riches) always with its leaves which serve as raiment and ornaments, with its fruits in the form of heavenly damsels appear in this place."
"Many the blessed moon-god (the duty presiding over annual plants) furnish me at
this place, excellent food of every variety, confections, sweets, sauces and syrups."
"May the blessed moon-god furnish me many-coloured flowers which have just fallen
from the flower-plants or trees, the drinks like wine and others as also various kinds of meat."
That sage Bharadwaja, with his intense meditation, possessing unequal splendour and with austerity, spoke as follows, in tones befitting proper articulation and pronunciation of the scriptural texts:
While that sage Bharadwaja, with joined palms, was meditating with absorption in the east, all those celestials came one by one.
Then, a pleasant comfortable and gracious breeze, passing over the mountains of
Malaya and Dardura, began to blw, removing sweat by its influence.
Thereafter wonderful clouds let loose a rain of flowers, while the sound of divine gongs could be heard on every side.
Troops of Apsaras (divine nymphs) danced to the melodious rustling of the wind. The clestials and the celestial musicians sang. Vinas, stringed musical instruments transmitted their tunes.
Sweat and harmonious sounds emitted smoothly, entered the sky earth and the ears of beings.
When those celestial melodies ceased so pleasingly heard by the human ears,
Bharata's army saw the wonderful creations of Visvakarma.
A levelled land of approximately twenty miles on all sides, became covered by many carpets of grass, dark as emerald.
At that place, Bilva, Kapittha, Panasa, Citron Amalaki and Mango Trees laden with
fruit appeared.
A forest of divine enjoyments from the territory of northern Kuru's along with a
river shaped with various trees on its bank appeared there.
Splendid square mansions with stables for elephants and horses as well as
resplendent gates with watch-towers flanked by turrets were seen.
A royal palace emerged, dazzling as a cloud, pierced by splendid arches, hung with white garlands, filled with fragrance of celestial perfumes, forming a perfect quadrangle, spacious, furnished with couches seats and palanquins, supplied with ambrosial drinks of every kind as well as magnificent attire and food of every variety, well-prepared eatables of every description in cleaned vessels free from dirt and all kinds of seats arranged in order looked
charming with superb couches duly covered with rich carpets.
The mighty armed Bharata the son of Kaikeyi on invitation by the great sage, entered that palace filled with precious gems.
All the ministers together with priests accompanied Bharata and on entering that
excellent get-up of the house, were filled with delight Bharata along with his ministers went clock-wise round the excellent royal throne, whisk and the royal umbrella kept there, as if they were utilized by a king.
They paid reverence to the royal seat, bowing before it, as if Rama sat thereon and thereafter Bharata, taking hold of the whisk, sat down on the seat meant for the chief minister.
All the ministers and priests sat down in order of precedence. Thereafter, the chief of the army and at last the officer-in-charge of the encampment occupied their seats.
Then, on an instant, by the orders of Bharadwaja, streams having milk thickened with rice in the place of mud, flowed towards Bharata.
On both the banks of those streams, enchanting and celestial houses plastered with white clay born out of the grace of Brahma the Lord of creation, appeared.
At that moment itself, twenty thousand women adorned with beautiful ornaments, sent by Brahma, arrived.
Twenty thousand more women, who were radiant and adorned with gold, gems, pearls and corals came from the region of Kubera.
A particular company of Apsaras, embraced by whom, a man looked as though seized
with insanity, came from Nandana grove.
Those most excellent kings among celestial musicians - Narada, Tumbura and Gopa
whose radiance is like that of the sun, began to sing in front of Bharata.
Then, on the command of Bharadwaja, Alambusa, MishraKesi and Vamana started dancing in the presence of Bharata.
By the command of Bharadwaja, wreaths of flowers which were beloved of the gods or those which grow in the woods of chaitra ratha were seen at Prayaga.
By the command of Bharadwaja, Bel trees assumed the form of drummers, Vibhitaka
trees assumed the form of cymbalists and Peepul trees assumed the form of dancers.
Then, dcodars palmyras and Tilaka trees along with Tamala trees transformed into
hunch backs and dwarfs and joyfully arrived there.
Shimshapas (Ashoka trees), Amalakis (Emblic myrobalan), Jambus (rose-apple trees), Malati, Mallika Jati and other creepers in the forest had been changed into dancing girls in the hermitage of Bharadwaja and they spoke as follows:
"O, wine-bibbers! Drink the wine, however much you desire! O troops stricken with
hunger! Let milk thickened iwth rice and the meats which are very much fresh, be eaten (as you will)"
Seven or eight young women bathed every single man on the beautiful river-banks,
after massaging their body with oil.
Women with charming eyes came running and shampooed their limbs. Lovely women
likewise wiped off the moisture on their body with towels and gave them beverages to drink, mutually sharing them among each other.
The keepers of animals fed horses, elephants, donkeys, camels and bullocks (the
offspring of Surabhi the divine cow) with their suitable feed.
The animals, belonging to the exceedingly strong and illustrious warriors, the
descendents of Ikshvaku, were fed with pieces of sugarcane and roasted grain soaked in honey, duly cajoling them to eat.
The groom did not recognise his horse. The elephant-keeper did not recognise his
elephant. That army there appeared intoxicated, maddened and enraptured on that spot.
With all their desires gratified, their bodies anointed with red-sandal paste, and surrounded by a company of Apsaras, those soldiers uttered the following words.
"We shall not go either to Ayodhya or to Dandaka forest. Let Bharata be well!
Likewise, let Rama too be at east!"
Having obtained that hospitality, the infantry, the cavalry as well as those mounted on elephants and their keepers too, no longer acknowledging their leaders, spoke the following words:
In the height of joy, those men in thousands there, the retinue of Bharata cried
out, "This is verily of heaven!"
The soldiers in thousands, wreathed in flowers danced, laughed, sang and ran hither and thither.
To those soldiers who had partaken that food which was as sweet as ambrosia, when
they saw again those fresh dishes, there arose in them a desire to eat them again.
Thousands of servants, slaves, youthful women and those in the army on every side, clad in new raiment, became very much contented.
Elephants, donkeys, camels, bullocks, horses, animals and birds there were suitably well-fed. Hence, one did not afflict the other.
There was no one seen in soiled attire or hungry or unkept or with hair powdered
with dust.
Dishes of goat and boar with delicious sauces were there and condiments that were
spicy, fragrant and succulent, cooked in fruit juices; vessels of rare metals filled with rice, decorated with flowers, were offered in thousands to those soldiers there. The soldiers saw them with wonder on all sides.
The wells in various sides of the forest (surrounding Bharadwaja's hermitage) have their mud transformed into milk in which rice was cooked. The cows in the region were transformed into cows of plenty and the trees dripped honey.
Some ponds there were endowed with full of wine and some were filled with assortment of various dressed meats pertaining to deer, peacocks and wild cocks; cooked in hot pans.
There were thousands of portable furnaces, lacs of culinary utensils ten crores of golden vessels, well-cleaned bowls filled with curds, small water-jars and wide-mouthed dishes.
Lakes full of fresh curds, shining fragrant and in the colour of a wood-apple, curds mixed with sugar and spices, some other lakes filled with shite curds, some others filled with milk soaked in rice as well as sugar and some other lakes with a mixture of barley and sugar were formed.
Those soldiers saw jellies, powders and syrups made of fruits and various kinds of accessories used in bathing, kept stored in vessels, on the banks of rivers.
Those soldiers saw there heaps of twings used for cleaning the teeth with white
brushes at their tips, white sandal pastes stored in caskets, polished mirrors, piles of clothes, thousands of pairs of shoes and sandals, caskets containing collyrium for the eyes; combs, brushed, raiments bows, protectors of vitals, strange couches and seats, drinking ponds for donkeys camels elephants and horses, lakes with good stairs for descent having water-lilies and lotuses with
sky-blue colour, with clear water offering a comfortable bath and soft grasses having a colour of Nipa tree and of cat's eye gems useful for feeding animals.
Seeing such a wonderful and dreamlike hospitality offered by the great sage
Bharadwaja, all those men were surprised.
While they were enjoying thus in that charming hermitage of Bharadwaja, in the same manner as celestials enjoy the garden of Nandna, that night had elapsed.
Having been permitted by Bharadwaja, those rivers, the celestial musicians and all those beautiful women went back by the same way they came.
The soldiers, intoxicated with spirituous liquor, were likewise excited with joy.
Likewise, the men were drenched in charming aloes and sandal paste. Various kinds of excellent and charming garlands were there, crushed and garlands were there, crushed and scattered at distances, likewise.Seeing that large army on the march, the herds of beasts with their leaders, the
denizens of the woods were frightened and ran away together.
Bears, dappled deer and antelopes could be seen every where, on the tracks of the
forest, on the hills and by the rivers.
That pious minded Bharata gracefully marched ahead, surrounded by that clamorous
army of four divisions.
The army, of the magnanimous Bharata, which resembled the high tide of an ocean,
covered the earth as clouds cover the sky in a rainy season.
Submerged by the waves of horses and elephants of great speed at that time, the
earth became invisible for a long time.
Having travelled for a long distance, that glorious Bharata, whose animals were now fully exhausted, said to Vasishta, the most segaceios of his counsellors (as follows) "Looking at the features of the pace and from what has been heard by me, it is clear that we reached that area of which Bharadwaja spoke."
"This mountain is Chitrakuta. This river is Mandakini. This forest is appearing like a blue cloud from a distance."
"By my elephants appearing themselves like mountains, the lovely peaks of Chitrakuta mountain are being trampled."
"These trees on the peaks of the mountain are shedding flowers, as black and intense clouds shower water in a rainy season."
"Behold, O Shatrughna, this mountain, (hitherto) frequented by Kinnaras, now teaming with horses on every side, as a sea is infested by allegators."
"These herds of antelopes, having a rapid speed, as urged forward (by the troops)
appear like a mass of clouds driven by the wind in the sky in antumn."
"Those tree, with their leaves in multitude dazzling, crowned with fragrant chaplets of flowers, resemble the people of the south."
"This forest, which was silent and wore a terrifying look till now, appears to me
like Ayodhya, swarning with people."
"The dust raised from the hooves of the horses blots out the heavens, but the wind carries it away immediately as if to give me pleasure."
"Behold, O Shatrughna, these chariots yoked with horses and mounted by the chief
charioteers are rushing together rapidly in the forest."
"Behold these peacocks and birds, which are pleasant to the sight, are frightened
and are entering their dwelling places hastily."
"This place to me is appearing very much lovely. Resembling in every way like a
threshold of heaven, it is clearly an abode of ascetics."
"In this forest, many dappled deer with their hinds, endowed with enchanting forms, are seen as if studded with flowers."
"Let the soldiers proceed quickly to explore the woods to find those tigers among
men, Rama and Lakshamana."
Hearing the words of Bharata, valiant men wearing weapons in their hands, penetrated into the forest suddenly they observed a plume of smoke rising.
Seeing that spiral of smoke, they returned to bharata and said; "There can be no
fire in a deserted place. Assuredly, Rama and Lakshmana are there."
"If it be not those two tigers among men, the two princes, the scourger of their
foes here, obviously there are other ascetics like Rama here."
Hearing those words concurred even by pious men, Bharata the destroyer of enemy's
forces, spoke to the entire army (as follows)
"You stay here vigilantly. Do no proceed any further. I alone will go along with
Sumantra and also Dhriti, my spiritual preceptor."
On this command, all the troops halted there and Bharat with his gaze fixed on the column of smoke, went forward.
The army, which was held up there by Bharata, eventhough perceiving the place ahead, felt rejoiced in the thought of meeting their beloved Rama soon.That valiant Bharata, having come to himself a long time on obtaining consciousness,saw his mother whose eyes were filled pitiably with tears, reproached her mother in the midst of the ministers and said as follows:-
"I never desired for the kingdom nor consulted about this matter with even my
mother. I was not aware of the proposed coronation, which has of the been contemplated by king Dasaratha; since I was staying indeed in a distant land, along with Satrughna."
"I was neither aware of the banishment of Rama to the forest nor about how the exile of Lakshmana and Seetha have occurred."
Recognising the voice of Bharata the noble man, crying out in that manner, Kausalya spoke the following words to Sumitra:
"Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, the doer terrific deeds arrived. I went to see that
far-sighted Bharata."
That kausalya who became pale with her demeanor, dirty and emaciated, speaking to
Sumitra as aforesaid, became agitated and absent minded and proceeded to Bharata's place.
Bharata, the younger brother of Rama on his part, along with Shatrughna started out to Kausalya's place.
Seeing Kausalya who was afflicted with grief, who fell unconscious (on the way) who was crying and who was an honorable woman with a noble mind. Shatrughna and Bharata wept in sorrow, approached her painfully and embraced her.
Kausalya who was very much in sorrow , spoke the following words to Bharata: "you, who have a desire for kingdom, have got this invincible kingdom ."Alas! By the cruel deed of Kaikeyi, it was obtained by you soon!"
"The ruthless Kaikeyi condemned my son to wear garments of bark and sent him to
dwell in the forest: What merit has she gained from this?"
"Kaikeyi ought to send me too without delay to the place where my illustrious son
with a golden novel (the distinguished mark of Vishnu the god of creation) is there."
"Otherwise, I for my own satisfaction accompanied by Sumitra, placing in
front(carried by Brahmana) the sacred fire*** will happily set out to the place Raghava has gone."
"Otherwise, you yourself ought to conduct me now, if you so desire, to the place
where my son, the tiger among men, is living as an ascetic."
"This vast kingdom, endowed with elephants, horses and chariots and stock piled with grains and riches, has been made over to you by her."
Derided with these and other harsh words that he had not merited, Bharata was
extremely perturbed, as if a needle was thrust into an open wound.
His mind being perplexed and having lost his consciousness, Bharata then coming his senses, wailed in many ways and fell at the feet of the queen.
Then, Bharata with folded hands, replied as follows to Kausalya who was encircled by afflictions and weeping as aforesaid in many ways:
"O, noble woman! Why do you reproach me, sinless as I am, for those things that I do not know anything? Nay, you know well of the greatest affection I have for Rama."
"May the mind of the one who in any way whatsoever allowed for the departure of my elder brother the best of men who keeps up his promise, be closed to all the seriptures."
"May he who counseled the banishment of my noble brother become the slave of the
vilest scoundrels, may he answer the calls of nature in the face of the sun and may he kick with his foot, a sleeping cow."
"With whose counsel my elder brother went to exile, to him let that sin incur, as to a master who imposes the heaviest labour on his servant without remunerating him."
"with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, to him let that sin incur as to those who seek to harm a king who protects his people as if they are his own children."
"May the guilt of a king, who taking the sixth part of the revenue of his people
fails to protect them, be fallen on them with whose counsel my elder brother went to exile."
"May the sin of those having given the promise for certain sacrificial fees to
priests in a sacrifice, breaks that promise, to be his with whose counsel my elder brother went to exile."
"May the sin of him, who fails to observe the code of warfare followed by the
virtuous in a battle abundantly provided with elephants horses chariots weapons and men, be his with whose counsel my elder brother went to exile."
"May that perverse wretch, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile,
forget the subtle meanings of the scriptures taught with care by a wise teacher."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, never behold that
Rama having large arms and broad shoulders radiant as the sun and the moon and seated as he will be on a throne."
"May that pitiless one with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sin of partaking milk boiled with rice and sugar a cooked mixture of rice and peas with a few species and a goat flesh without offering them to the gods and be lacking in reverence towards teachers."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sins of
kicking the cows, of personally abusing the elders and of deceiving a friend too much."
"May that perverse wretch with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile
incur the sin of divulging a little abusing words about others spoken occasionally in secret and in confidence, to him."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, become a non doer, an ungrateful person; a desperate man, the one who has abandoned shame and the one who is worthy of hate."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sin of
eating delicious food for himself alone when he is surrounded by his sons , wife and servants in his house."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has departed; die issueless, failing to secure a wife suitable for him and thus not fulfilling his religious duties."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has departed, not see a child through
his wife and in distress, may not get a full long life."
"That sin which was proclaimed in killing a king a woman, a child or an aged person or in abandoning one's dependents let him (with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile) obtain the same sin."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, obtain, tat= the sin of nurturing his wife children and other dependents through sale of lacquer, liquor, flesh, iron or poison."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, obtain the sin of
being killed while fleeing, at a time when a battle inspiring fear upon enemy's side has commanded."
May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, wander about the
world, as a mad man with a wooden bowl in his hand, dressed in rags and begging for alms."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has departed, be given over to
infatuation and anger and be constantly involved in wine women and dice."
May the mind of man with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, never
take delight in righteousness? Let him indulge in un righteousness and become a distributor of gifts for the undeserving."
"With whose counsel , my elder brother has gone to exile, let his various kinds of riches got accumulated in thousands , be snatched away by robbers."
"That sin which was proclaimed on him who sleeps during both the twilights, let that sin be obtained by him, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile."
"Let him obtains that sin, which attaches to a man who practices arson, to a man who violets his teacher's bed and to a man who cheats his friend."
"May he, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur that sin of
not doing service to be god, to the manes and likewise to his mother and father."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, forfeit soon and now from the region obtained by virtuous man, forfeit the illustriousness enjoyed by good men and the righteous actions."
"May he with whose counsel, that long armed and broad chested elder brother has gone to exile, fail to give due reverence to his mother and be condemned to idleness."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, possess many

staying in fear of the king forever as a cunning man, a cruel man, a back biter, a dishonest man and an unrighteous man."
"May the evil minded man, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile,

"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sin that is attached to a person polluting the drinking water and likewise to a person who administers poison."
"May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sin

"To him, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, let that sin be
obtained of disappointing a person oppressed with thirst, even though water was available."
"With whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, let the sin be accorded to him, who while standing on the road, merely witnesses a dispute between two divided groups without trying to make peace between them."
"While thus counseling Kausalya, who was bereft of her husband and son, the prince Bharata fell down, depressed as he was with anguish."
Kausalya spoke the following words to Bharata who was tormented with grief, was
quite distraught and who just uttered formidable imprecations in the aforesaid manner: "O, son! My grief is further enhanced. By uttering the curses, you are indeed racking my spirits."
"O ,son! Fortunately, your mind as it is endowed with nobility, has not swerved from righteous path. You will obtain the world of the blessed, along with Lakshmana."
Thus speaking to Bharata who was devoted to his brother Rama, she took the valiant Bharata to her lap, embraced him and wept aloud , as she was very much afflicted with grief.
Lamenting thus, the great soled Bharata distraught on account of grief, felt himself about to swoon, with his mind crushed by the burden of grief.
To Bharata that night passed with grief in lamenting thus laying fallen unconscious on the ground, sighing warmly again and again with his power of discernment having been lost.After having passed the tenth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata having himself purified, performed Shraddha* rites on the arrival of the twelfth day.
On the occasion of Shraddha rites, Bharata gave precious stones, money, a lot of
cooked rice, very valuable clothes and various other kinds of presents to Brahmans.
In that ceremony performed in honor of the dead king, Bharata the son of Dasaratha gave multitudes of white goats, hundreds of cows, servants and servant maids, vehicles and very big houses to Brahmans.
Then, at the time of dawn on the thirteenth day, the mighty armed Bharata who came for clearing up bones and ashes, wept in grief, his throat being choked of sound (because of crying) and spoke in great distress the following words, having reached the foot of his father's funeral pile (to collect the bones and ashes for their immersion in Sarayu River).
"O, father! My brother Rama to whose care I was entrusted by you, having gone on
exile to the forest, I now become abandoned wholly alone, by you."
"O, king! O, father! Where have you gone, leaving Kausalya the mother whose son
Rama, her support, has been sent away from home to the forest?"
Seeing that spot of collection (of bones), which became reddish brown in colour
because of ashes, with bones consumed by fire and his father's body having extinguished, Bharata was depressed and began to cry loudly.
Miserable as he was to see the spot, Bharata fell weeping on the ground, as a flag staff fastened by any mechanical contrivance would drop down while being raised in honor of Indra the god of celestials.
All his ministers hastily approached Bharata who was virtuous in conduct, as sages once rushed to the fallen Yayati at the time of his death.
Seeing Bharata, Shatrughna was also overwhelmed with grief and while recollecting
the king, fell unconscious on the ground.
Remembering the many gestures of his father resulting from his loving qualities made from time to time, Shatrughna was lamenting (as follows) like one who has lost his wits, bewildered as he was.
"We are immersed in a violent and appalling ocean of sorrow invoked by Mandhara, in which Kaikeyi in the form of a crocodile swam in its current the irrevocable boons granted to her by my father."
"O, father! Where have you gone leaving the lamenting Bharata, your boy always being caressed by you."
"You used to fulfill the wishes of all of us, in the matter of eatables, drinks,
clothes, and jewels. Who else will do it (now) for us."
"That earth which is deprived of you, the high soled and righteous king, is not
riven even when it is the time to be riven."
"The father having obtained heaven and Rama having taken refuge in a forest, what is the significance of life for me? I shall enter a fire."
"Bereft of my brother and father, I can not return to the deserted city of Ayodhya, where Ikshvaku used to reign. I shall retire to a hermitage."
Hearing the lamentation of both of them and beholding their plight, all their
companions were disturbed very much, once again.
Both Shatrughna, and Bharata were wearied with grief and began to roll on the
ground, like two bulls whose horns have been broken.
Then, Vasista, a noble man, a learned man and the family priest of their father,
raised up that Bharata from the ground and spoke the following words:
"O, Lord Bharata! This is the thirteenth day of the death of your father. Why are
you hanging down here, when the ceremony of collecting the bones is still unfinished?"
"The three pairs of opposites (namely hunger and thirst, joy and sorrow; birth and death) occur to all living beings without any distinction. They being inevitable, you ought not to behave like this."
Even Sumantra, who knew the Truth, raising up Shatrughna and pacifying him, told him about the origin and dissolution of all beings.
The two illustrious tigers among men (Bharata and Satrughna) who had got up,
appeared like two banners severally raised in honor of Indra (the god of celestials) soiled through rain and the sun.
The ministers hurried up the princes, who were wiping their tears and who were
talking pitiably with their eyes reddened (due to excessive weeping) to expedite the other rites pertaining to the thirteenth day.Thereafter, Bharata along with his routine, who were treated hospitably, spent that night there and sought out Bharadwaja with fondness.
The sage Bharadwaja, who had offered oblations in sacred fire, spoke to Bharata the tiger among men, who had come there with joined palms, saying.
"O, handsome Bharata! Have you passed this night at out place comfortably? Is your retinue fully satisfied with my hospitality? Tell me."
After joining his palms in salutation, Bharata replied to the very glorious sage
Bharawaja, who came out from his hermitage (as follows):
"O, venerable sage! With all the enjoyments in plenty provided by you, I felt
comfortable and satisfied, along with very ministers my entire army and our animals too used in riding.
"All of us including our servants have become very much satisfied with our fatigue and pains removed, having eaten a good food and having been provided an excellent accommodation."
"O, Blessed one! O, excellent sage I am taking leave of you. Look on me with favour as I find myself in my brother's vicinity."
"O, knower of piety! Tell me about the abode of that high-souled and pious man,
Rama. Tell me as to which way I have to go, how much distance it is from here and so forth."
The highly glorious Bharadwaaja, of rigid asceticism, thus questioned by Bharata
(who intensely desired to see his brother again), answered him as follows:
"O, Bharata! About twenty eight miles from here, there is a mountain called
Chitrakuta, in the middle of a lonely forest with its charming Cascades and groves."
"Going towards its northern side, you will find River Mandakini, which is entirely enveloped with flowering trees and having forests flourished with charming blossoms."
"O, beloved Bharata! Beyond that river, there is a mountain called Chitrakuta and on it, their hut made of leafy twigs. Both of them are residing there. It is sure."
"O, the illustrious chief of army! Direct the forces filled with elephants horses
and chariots either towards the southern route or to the left proceeding southward. You can see Rama then."
Hearing him speak of the journey, Dasaratha's wives eligible of sitting in
palanquins, descended from their palanquins and stood encircling Bharadwaja.
Kaikeyi with her unfulfilled desire and despised by the whole world, clasped the
sage's feet with bashfulness.
Kaikeyi with her unfulfilled desire and despised by the whole world, clasped the
sage's feet with bashfullness.
Then, having gone around that venerable and eminent sage clock-wise, she stood close to Bharata himself, distressed as she was at heart.
Then, Bharadwaja, firm in austerity, enquired Bharata as follows: "O, Bharata! I
wish to know the distinctions of your mothers."
Hearing the words of the learned sage, Bharadwaja, Bharata who was skilled in
expression, with joined palms, spoke the following words.
"O, venerable sage! This miserable queen emaciated by grief and fasting, is the
royal consort of my father, who you see resembling a goddess - it is she, Kausalya who, as Aditi gave birth to Upendra, begot that Tiger among the heroes, with the great gait and pride of a lion that Rama."
She, who stands clinging to the left shoulder of Kausalya, plunged in grief is the unfortunate Sumitra, looking like a branch of Karnikara tree with withered flowers standing in the interior of the grove. Both Lakshmana and Shatrughna, the two heroic princes of god-like appearance and unfailing prowess are the sons of this godly woman, Sumitra.
"She, through whose fault, those two tigers among men have to obtain a miserable
existence and King Dasaratha deprived of his son, has gone to heaven this woman, who is irate, imprudent, arrogant, who esteems herself to be good-looking, who is covetous of power, unworthy though noble to all appearance, know her to be Kaikeyi, my mother of wicked and sinful resolve, in whom I see the root cause of my great misfortune."
Bharata, the tiger among men, with his red eyes spoke thus in a voice broken by sobs and breathing as he like an enraged and hissing snake.
Hearing the aforesaid words spoken by Bharata, Bharadwaja the great intellectual
sage replied in the following meaningful words.
"O, Bharata! Kaikeyi is not intended to be understood by you accusatively. The exile of Rama with indeed become ultimately a cause for happiness!"
"Now, due to Rama's exile, there will indeed be a benefit to the celestials the
demons and the sages whose souls are purified by meditating on the Universal Spirit."
Bharata satisfied, paid obeisance to him and circumambulated him in bidding a
farewell, directing the army to get prepared to leave.
Then, setting out for their destination, countless people ascended many excellent
chariots, decorated with gold, duly harnessed to horses.
Female and male elephants, wearing golden chains and flags, distinguished by the
sound of bells, like thundering clouds at the end of a summer marched in a form.
Various precious conveyances, both big and small, marched forward. Pedestrians
marched forward by foot.
Desirous of seeing Rama and delighted, Kausalya and other honourable women
thereafter advanced on their excellent conveyances.
The illustrious Bharata mounted a readily kept palanquin which was auspiciously
shining like rising moon and sun and proceeded along with his escort.
That vast army with its countless elephants horses and chariots proceeded, covering the southern direction, like a great cloud that has risen in the sky and on the other bank of the Ganges, by mountains and streams, crossing the woods inhabited by deer and birds.
That army of Bharata, with its squadrons of rejoicing elephants horses and warriors, penetrating into the vast forest, frightening innumerable beasts and birds, appeared resplendent there.Having heard all that perfectly, Bharata approached the foot of Ingudi Tree along
with his ministers and gazed on that grass-bed on which Rama had slept. Thereafter, he said to all his mothers as follows: "It is here that the magnanimous hero laid himself for that night, his limbs pressing the earth."
"Born of the great and segacious Dasaratha in an illustrious family, Rama verily
does not desrve to sleep on this bare earth!"
"How could Rama the tiger among men, who used to sleep on a couch horded with rich cushions covered with superior hairy skins of antelopes, sleep on a bare floor?"
"Having ever dwelt in palaces, the upper apartments resembling the chariots of the gods and in turrets, furnished with excellent carpets decked with heaps of flowers, perfumed with sandal and aloes, like unto a bright and towering cloud, re-echoing to the cries of parrots, suprassing the finest of palaces, which wre cool and fragrant with perfules, as unto Mount Meru with its golden walls, where in that palace he was awakened at the fitting time by sogns and music from various instruments, tinkling of ornaments and the excellent sounds of clay tomtoms, glorified by many panegyrists, bards and ministrels throught appropriate ballads and songs of praise."
"This ( such a prince becoming like this) is unbelievable in the world and does not appear true to me. My mind is indeed bewildered. I wish that it were a dream."
"Surely even a deity is not a little more powerful than Time (the will of god),
since that Rama, the son of Dasaratha has to sleep on the bare ground!"
"Even Seetha the daughter of the king of videha, lovely to look upon and the
cherished daughter-in-law of Dasaratha has to sleep on the floor!"
"This is the bed of my elder brother. Here are indeed the blessed marks of his
changing sides, in the form of all the blades of Kusa grass, trampled by his limbs on the hard ground."
"I think the blessed Seetha has slept on this bed along with her jewels for, some
particles of gold appear to be stuck up, here and there."
"It is very clear that the upper garment of Seetha got entangled with these blades here at that time. That is why, these silk-threads appear stuck to them."
"I think the bed of her husband is sweet to a woman and thought Seetha is young and unfortunate, yet however delicate she be, she would experience no suffering."
"Alas! I am a cruel man because on my account, Rama, like an orphan, along with his wife slept on such a bed."
"How can Rama, born in the race of monarchs, highly honoured by the entire world,
beloved of all the people, having a dark complexion as that of a blue-lotus, having red eyes, lovely to look at who is entittled for comfort and who is not worthy of suffering, sleep on the gound, abandoning excellent kingdom and comfort?"
"Lakshmana, having auspicious marks on his body and an exceedingly lucky man, who
accompanied his elder brother Rama in times of adversity in indeed a fortunate man."
"Seetha, who went together with her husband to the forest, is indeed an accomplished woman. All of us, deprived of the highly virtuous Rama, are an unsettled lot."
"Dasaratha went to heaven. Rama is dwelling in the forest. this kingdom appears to me as a boat without ahelmsman."
"Even if staying in the forest, Rama protects this earth with the power of his arms.Hence, nobdy can think even in his mind, to invade this kingdom."
"Without guards to watch over its ramparts, with its unrestrained horses and
elephants, with its city-gates laid open, without any defenders, denuded of its happy army, plunged in desolation in difficulties and exposed, that royal capital of Ayodhya will be shunned like poisoned food even by the enemies."
"From today onwards, I shall sleep on the earth or on the grass, with my locks
matted, wearing robes of bark and by all means living on fruits and roots."
"For the rest of his exile, on behalf of Rama, I shall dwell cheerfully in the
forest, thereby discharging that promise so that the vows of Rama shall not have been made in vain."
"Shatrughna will bear company with me, residing in the forest on behalf of Rama. My elder brother, Rama along with Lakshmana will protect Ayodhya."
"Rama will be enthroned in ayodhya, by Brahmanas the Twice-born! May the gods grant that my desire be made a reality."
"Should Rama not accept the respectful appeals made in many a way by me, I shall
follow the foot steps of Rama for any length of time he roams about in the forest thereafter. He ought not to refuse this grace to me."Bharata, born in Raghu race, having passed the night in that place on the banks of Ganga, rising at dawn, said to shatrughna as follows:
"O, Shatrughna! wake up! Why sleep longer/ Bring guha the king of Nishadhas quickly and be happy. Let him convey the army across the river."
Thus urged by Bhrata, his brother Shatrughna said, "I am not sleeping. Thinking of that Rama alone, I have been wakeful."
While those two lions among men were talking themselves with each other thus, Guhacame in time and with joined palms, addressed Bharata saying:
"O, Bhrata! Did you pass the night happily on the banks of the river? I hope all is well with your army."
Hearing those words of Guha spoken with affection, Bharata also in his devotion to Rama, replied as follows:
"O, king! The night passed leasantly fo r us. We were treated hospitably by you. Let your fisher-men ferry us across Ganga River on your courtless boats."
Hearing Bharata's command, Guha returned to the city in all haste and spoke to those multitude of his people (as follows):
"Rise, awake and may prosperity ever attend you! Duly haul the boats to the bank.
Let us carry the army across the river."
Rising immediately on hearing the command of their king, they quickly brought
together five hundred boats from every quarter.
Some excellent boats, possessing large bells were marked with Sawstika, well-kept
together with appropriate sails and adorned with flags.
Then, Guha brought there one boat also adorned with Swastika, was covered with white canvas, re-echoing with acclamations and which was beautiful.
Vasishta, the royal priest and whatever elderly Brahmanas were present there
ascended the boats, even before Bharata, Shatrughna, Kausalya, Sumitra. Whatever royal women were present also took theri seats. Thereafter followed the king's wives a well as bullock- carts and provisions.
The sound of men setting fire to the huts, of those who were descending the steps
leading to the boat and those who were transporting their effects touched the sky.
Thos boats, adorned with flags, steered by fisher-men themselves ran speedily, duly carrying those passengers.
Some were filled with women. Some were loaded with horses and some of them ferried animals of draught of great value.
Having reached the opposite shore, thsoe boats cleared those people and on the
return journey, the kinsfolk of guha plied them as easily as toy- boats made of bamboo.
Goaded on by their mahouts, elephants adorned with their flags, swimming across the river, looked life winged mountains.
Some ascended boats. Some others crossed the river by rafts in the same manner. Some others swam across with the help of big and small earthen vessels. The rest swam with arms.
Having made to cross River Ganga by the fisher-men themselves, that holy army
reached the magnificient woods of Prayaga at the hour of Maitra.
The high-souled Bharata made the army to rest, by encamping it according to its
inclination and set out along with the priests and king's counsellors to meet Bharadwaja, the foremost of sages.
Approaching the hermitage of that high-souled Brahmana and the family priest of
gods, Bharata saw an extensive and enchanting grove with its leafy huts and tress the chief of ascatics.Having stationed his forces, Bharata set out eagerly to see his brother, pointing
out the sign of Rama's habitation to Shatrughna.
Bharata, who was affectionate towards the elders, asked the sage Vasishta to bring his mothers soon thereafter and went ahead quickly.
Sumantra also, equally desirous of seeing Rama; followed Shatrughna at a little
distance.
While the illustrious Bharata passed on, he observed in that wood of ascetics, a
leafy hut of his brother together with a small hut made of leaves, nearby.
Bharata then beheld wood that had been broken up and heaps of flowers gathered in
front of that hermitage.
While coming to the hermitage, Bharata saw some signs here and there serving as a
proper direction to that hermitage, tufts of Kusha grass and strips of bark tied to the trees by Rama and Lakshmana.
Bharata also saw in the vicinity great heaps of dried dung of deers and buffaloes, kept ready for protection against cold.
Then, proceeding further, the valiant and the mighty armed Bharata spoke to
Shatrughna in joy, as also those ministers who surrounded him.
"I think we have reached the place about which Bharadwaja directed us. I believe
Mandakini River is not far from here."
"These pieces of bark have been tied up from above. This may be the path provided as signs by Lakshmana in order to find his way back in odd hours of darkness."
"At the side of the mountain, this is a roaming place of elephants, having huge
teeth, violent as they are and ferociously roaring at each other."
"See this intense smoke coming from that fire which the sages in the forest always desire to keep in their hermitages."
"Here, I can see joyfully Rama, the tiger among men, who gives respect to elders and is as venerable as a sage."
Proceeding for a while on Chitrakuta mountain and reaching the River Mandakini, that Bharata said to his ministers and others as follows:
"The foremost of men and the Lord of the people, having sought seclusion, sat on the floor, delighted as he was in the posture of a hero (with his left foot placed on his right knee).
O Fie unto my birth and life!"
"Rama the Lord of Men with great luster, has been overtaken by this misfortune
because of me and leaving all enjoyments, is living in the forest."
"Thus abhhored by the world, I will fall on the feet of Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana and seek to regain Rama's grace."
As Bharata was lamenting thus, he beheld in that forest, a splendid and sacred leafy hut, which was covered with many soft leaves of Sala, Tala and Asvakarna trees, overspread withblades of Kusa grass in a sacrificial performance, appearing like an extensive altar and it was adorned with bows plated with gold, like unto the weapons of Indra the Lord of celestials, constructed for heroic exploits, having great power, the torments of their foes, graced with fearful arrows in their quivers, like unto the rays of the sun, bright as serpents with shining hoods, in the same way of Bhagavati (the realm of Nagas), decked with a couple of swords encased in sheaths of gold, adorned with two shields decorated with flowers of gold, finger-guards embroidered with gold and in different colours suspended on walls and which hut was unassailable by hordes of
enemies as is a lion's cave to deer.
Bharata saw a sacrificial altar in the north-east corner having a steep descent,
extensive in area and having a sacred fire burned in the hermitage of Rama.
Looking around for a moment, Bharata beheld his elder brother, Rama himself seated in the hut, wearing matted locks.
Bharata saw that Rama clad in an antelope-skin and robes of bark, seated close by, resembling a fire (in brilliance), with the neck and shoulders of a lion, mighty arms and eyes resembling the lotus, the very virtuous Lord of the Earth extending upto the ocean, the Eternal Brahma, and seated on the ground spread with Darbha grass, with Seetha and Lakshmana.
Beholding him, the illustrious and the high-souled Bharata the son of Kaikeyim
distraught by the grief that possessed him, rushed towards Rama.
On seeing his brother, Bharata broke into lamentations and in a voice strangled with sobs, unable to restrain his agony with firmeness, said:
"My elder brother who is fit to be honoured in an assembly by a body of ministers
around him, is now being served by a body of wild beasts around him in this jungle."
"That magnanimous hero, who formerly used to possess countless articles of apparel is now wearing two antelope-skins, following ascetic righteousness.
"How this Rama, who used to wear various kinds of colourful flowers, is bearing this burden of matted locks now?"
"He who acquired merit through countless sacrifices performed according to the
prescribed injunctions, now follows the path of righteousness through asceticism!"
"He whose body was formerly rendered fragrant by white sandal paste, has only dust with which to smear the limbs of this venerable elder brother!"
"Rama who used to have happiness, has fallen into this misfortune, because of me
cursed be my reprehensive existence that the whole world condemns!"
Thus did that pitiable Bharata lament, perspiration be-dewing his lotus-like
countenance and, without touching Rama's feet, fell down grooming.
Overcome with grief, the highly valiant prince Bharata cried out "O, Noble One!"
once and in his distress, was unable to speak anything further.
Crying at the top of his voice, "O, Noble One" only, on seeing the illustrious Rama, he was unable to speak further, his throat choked with tears.
Shatrughna too, weeping, threw himself at Rama's feet and Rama too, embracing them both, allowed his tears to fall.
Then, in that forest, the princes Rama and Lakshmana were seen by Sumantra and Guha, as in the sky, the sun and the moon are seen in conjunction with Venus and Jupiter.
All those dwellers in the woods, seeing those princes resembling leaders of
elephant-herbs meeting together there in that great forest, losing their cheerfulness, began to shed tears."Hearing the news of a great happiness from Hanuma, Bharata the truly brave ruler
and the destroyer of enemies, commanded (as follows) to Shatrughna, who too felt delighted at the
news."
"Let men of good conduct, offer worship to their family-deities, sanctuaries in the
city with sweet-smelling flowers and to the accompaniment of musical instruments."
"Let bards well-versed in singing praises and Puranas (containing ancient legends,
cosmogony etc.) as also all panegyrists, all those proficient in the use of musical instruments,
courtesans all collected together, the queen-mothers, ministers, army-men and their wives,
brahmanas accompanied by Kshatriyas (members of fighting class), leaders of guilds of traders and
artisans, as also their members, come out to see the moon-like countenance of Rama."
Hearing the words of Bharata, Shatrughna the destroyer of valiant adversaries called
together, laborers working on wages, numbering many thousands and dividing them into gangs, ordered
them (as follows):
"Let the cavities on the path from Nandigrama to Ayodhya be levelled. Let the rough
and the even places be made flat."
"Let the entire ground be sprinkled with ice-gold water. Let some others strew it
all over with parched grains and flowers."
"Let the streets in Ayodhya, the excellent City, be lined with flags. Let the
dwellings (on the road-side) be decorated, till the time of rising of the sun."
"Let hundreds of men sprinkle, on the main royal highway, with five fragrant colours
and with rows of garlands as well as lose flowers."
On hearing that command of Shatrughna, Dhrushti, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha,
Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, Mantrapala and Sumantra proceeded with joy.
Some rode on thousands of well-adorned elephants in rut and bearing banners. Some
others rode on female-elephants provided with golden girths, along with those elephants. Excellent
chariot-warriors issued forth in their chariots, with speed.
Warriors on selected horses even still superior ones in thousands, bearing banners
and pennants, carrying javelins, spears and nooses, as also surrounded by thousands of
foot-soldiers, sallied forth.
Then, all the wives of the deceased Dasaratha, placing Kausalya and Sumitra in front
of them, mounting their vehicles, issued forth. All of them, including Kaikeyi, reached
Nandigrama.
Placing the wooden sandals of his brother (Rama) on his head and taking the white
parasol (intended for Rama) which was adorned with white garlands and two white whisks decorated
with gold, eminently worthy of kings, accompanied by the foremost of Brahmanas, leaders of the
guilds of traders and artisans, including the mercantile class, surrounded by the counselors with
garlands and bell-shaped sweets in their hands, cheered by the blass of conches and kettle-drums,
duly praised by panegyrists, the great-souled Bharata, for his part, whose mind was set on
righteousness, who was well-versed with the secret of virtue, who was emaciated through fasting,
who felt miserable, was clad in the bark of trees and the sking of a black antelope, who
experienced joy for the first time in hearing the news of the arrival of his brother then went in
advance, along with his ministers, to meet Rama."
The earth seemed, as it were, shaking with the sound of horse-hoofs the rattling of
rims of chariot-wheels and by the tumults of couches and kettle-drums.
The entire City of Ayodhya literally reached Nandigrama. Glancing round, Bharata
spoke as follows to Hanuma.
"Indeed, I hope the fickle-mindedness which constitutes the peculiarity of monkeys,
has not been resorted to by you. For I do not indeed see Rama, a worthy scion of Kakutthsa and the
destroyer of adversaries."
When these remarks were uttered by Bharata, Hanuma forthwith replied, as follows to
Bharata of unfailing prowess, by his meaningful words which were, as if they were apprising the
situation.
"A formidable roar of rejoiced monkeys is being heard, for, they are seeing on the
way, trees which continually, yield fruit, adorned with blossom, flowing with honey which is drunk
by bees, making reverberant humming sounds - all due to the grace of Sage Bharadwaja O Bharata, the
destroyer of adversaries! A boon was conferred by Indra, the lord of celestials, by virtue of which
a hospitality rich with all excellences was earlier extended by Bharadwaja to you, with your entire
army. I presume that the aforesaid army of monkeys is crossing the rivers, Gomati."
"See the cloud of dust, shooting froths towards the grove of Sala trees. I presume
that the monkeys are shaking the beautiful grove of Sala trees."
"There is seen, in distance, that very famous aerial car, shining brightly like the
moon. The wonderful aerial car called Pushpaka was built with his intelligence by Viswakarma (an
architect of gods, who has been referred to here as Brahma by virtue of his creative talent.)."
"This wonderful aerial car, with a speed of thought, which is carrying the great
souled Rama, and shines brightly like the rising sun, belongs to Kubera, the lord of riches, by the
grace of brahma, the lord of creation. (Who bestowed it on him)"
"In the same aerial car are the valiant Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers, along with
Seetha, the immensely brilliant Sugreeva and Vibhishana the demon."
Meanwhile, the words 'Here comes Rama' were loudly said and a clamour born of joy
from the mouth of women, children, youth and elders touched the sky.
Descending from their chariots, elephants as also horses and standing on the ground,
all those people saw, like the moon in the sky, that Rama seated in the aerial car.
The over-joyed Bharata with his joined palms, his face turned towards Rama,
worshipped and welcomed him in a befitting way.
Rama, with his long and large eyes, seated in the aerial car, created by Viswakarma
the divine architect with his intelligence, shone like another Indra who carries the thunderbolt in
his hand.
Bent low in reverence, Bharata then saluted Rama, who stood in the forepart of the
aerial car and shining like the sun appearing on Mount Meru.
As authorized by Rama, that excellent aerial car, having a great speed and endowed
with the images of swans, landed on the ground.
Feeling glad, when lifted on that aerial car and approaching Rama, Bharata of true
valour, greeted him yet again.
Fully rising from his seat and placing that Bharata, who was seen after a long time,
on his lap, Rama delightfully embraced him.
Thereafter, the jubilant Bharata, the destroyer of adversaries, approaching
Lakshmana and Seetha, then saluted them in reverence and also announced his name.
Then, Bharata embraced Sugreeva, Jambavan, Angada, Mainda, Dvivida, Neela and
Rishabha.
He also embraced Sushena, Nala, Gavaksha, Gandhamadana, Sharabha, Panasa and the
surrounding monkeys.
Then, those monkeys, who can change their form at will, assumed the form of humans
and rejoicingly asked about the welfare of Bharata.
Thereupon, the immensely brilliant Bharata, the son of Dasaratha and the foremost
among the virtuous, after embracing Sugreeva the excellent monkey, spoke to him (as follows):
"You are a fifth brother, for all the four of us, O Sugreeva! A friend is born of
affection, while malifience is the attribute of an adversary."
Thereafter, Bharata spoke the following kind words to Vibhishan: "Thank heaven! A
very difficult task was accomplished by you, as a companion of Rama."
Then, the valiant Shatrughna offered his salutation to Rama, along with Lakshmana
and offered his reverential salutation to Seetha's feet, by bowing in humility.
By going to his mother, who became pale and emaciated due to her grief, Rama, by
bowing, seized her feet in salutation, making his mother's heart delighted.
Offering salutation to Sumatra, the illustrious Kaikeyi and all his mothers, Rama
then went to Vasishta the priest and offered his salutation in reverence.
With joined palms, all the citizens of Ayodhya said to Rama: "Welcome to you, O the
great-armed! O the enhancer of Kausala's delight!"
Rama saw those thousands of joined palms held by the citizens, appearing as
lotus-flowers in bloom.
Taking those wooden sandals of Rama, Bharata, the knower of virtue, personally
placed them below the feet of Rama, the lord of men.
Having offered his salutation with joined palms, Bharata spoke to Rama as follows:
"This entire sovereignty of yours, kept with me as a deposit, is being returned to you, by me."
"My life has accomplished its purpose today and my wish too stands fulfilled, in
that I see you, its king, come back to Ayodhya."
"You review your treasury, granary, palace of your spirit, everything has been
enhanced tenfold by me."
Seeing that Bharata, speaking thus with affection with his brother, Vibhishana the
demon and the monkeys shed their tears.
Placing Bharata on his lap with delight, Rama thereupon flew with his army (of
monkeys and bears) in that aerial car to the hermitage of Bharata.
Reaching the hermitage of Bharata along with his army Rama then descended from the
anterior of the aerial car and stood, for the time-being, on the ground.
Then, Rama, for his part, spoke to that excellent aerial car, "Serve as a transport
to Kubera, the lord. I permit you to leave."
Thus permitted by Rama, that excellent aerial car, thereupon proceeded towards the
northern direction, so as t reach the abode of Kubera the lord of riches.
That wonderful aerial car, Pushpaka which was seized by Ravana once, went in speed
to Kubera, as impelled by Rama's advice.
Affectionately pressing the feet of Vasishta, his well-wisher and family-priest,
even as Indra the lord of celestials would press the feet of Brihaspati (the preceptor of gods),
the valiant Rama sat by his side, on a separate seat.After encamping the army, the mighty Bharata the excellent among men, sought to
approach on foot, Rama who was complying with the words of his father.
Soon after encamping the army in a well-behaved manner per the guidelines, Bharata
spoke the following words to Shatrughna:
"O, gentle brother! You, along with a troop of men and trackers, ought to search on
all sides of this forest."
"Let Guha search for Rama and Lakshmana in this forest, himself accompanied by a
multitude of his kinsmen, duly wielding their bows, arrows and swords."
"I too, surrounded by the ministers, citizens, priests and Brahmanas; shall
personally go round the entire forest on foot.
"Peace will not be with me until I do not see Rama or the very mighty Lakshmana or
the illustrious Seetha."
"Peace will not be with me until I do not see the auspicious face of my elder
brother, resembling the moon and having eyes bearing resemblance to lotus-leaves.
"Peace will nt be with me until I do not hold firmly on my head, the soles of my
elder brother, bearing royal insignia.
"Peace will not come to me until my elder brother, who is eligible for the crown, is not installed in the kingdom of Ayodhya, which was derived from our father and grand father and consecrated by sprinkling water on his head (as a symbol of crowing the kingdom)."
"Lakshmana, who is seeing regularly the face of Rama having a great luminance
resembling the bright moon and having lotus eyes, is indeed an accomplished man."
"Seetha, the illustrious daughter of Janaka, who is following the steps of Rama the
Lord of the earth extending to the sea, has fulfilled her object."
"That enchanting mountain of Chitrakuta resembles the King of Mountains on which
Rama is residing, as Kubera the Lord of riches is living in the garden of Nandana."
"Blessed is this dense forest, inhabited by wild animals, where Rama, the great
warrior and the excellent man among the wielders of weapons, dwells."The highly illustrious Lord, Bharata riding on a chariot emanating a gentle and deep sound entered soon the city of Ayodhya.
He entered the city, frequented by cats and owls, abiding with crouched men and
elephants and looking like a night enveloped by gloom, indistinctness and darkness.
Ayodhya looked like the planet Rohini, the beloved consort of the moon-god (treated as the enemy by the demon Rahu), tormented by planet Rahu* in the ascendant though ordinarily invested with an exceedingly bright splendour by virtue of her glory.
Ayodhya further looked emaciated like a mountain stream, whose scanty waters had
become hot and agitated, birds living in which were scorched by the sun, and whose fish, small and big and alligators had perished.
Ayodhya looked like a flame of sacrificial fire which when oblation is poured into it, rises like a golden cone without smoke and thereafter sinks into extinction (ash).
Ayodhya looked like an afflicted army, shattered of its armour in a major conflict, whose ensigns borne on horses, elephants and chariots had been torn, and its heroic warriors slain.
Ayodhya appeared like the waves of the sea though tosses very high with foam and a roar, is rendered noiseless, being shaken up by a silent wind.
Ayodhya appeared like a sacred altar, which, when the period of offering oblations into fire has completely expired, has been cleared of all sacrificial implements and deserted of recitations by the learned priests.
Ayodhya appeared like restless kine, deprived of the bull, who cease to graze in new pastures and stand in the cow-pen, dispirited.
Ayodhya was resembling a new pearl-necklace, bereft of well- polished dazzling and excellent gems, rubies and the like, of genuine quality.
Ayodhya appeared like a meteor, which moved from its position with its virtue
exhausted, soon dropped from the sky and fallen to earth, deprived of its splendour.
Ayodhya appeared like a flowering creeper laden with blossom in the spring-tide,
frequented by a swarm of intoxicated bees, that is suddenly consumed by a forest fire and withering.
With its senseless traffic paralyzed and with its fairs and markets closed, Ayodhya resembled like a firmament, covered with clouds, with the moon and stars obscured.
Ayodhya appeared splendourless, like a deserted and uncleaned tavern, with its
vendor of spirituous liquors killed, the excellent wine expended, its drinking pots and glasses broken and the pieces stewn in disorder.
Ayodhya resembled a cistern erected for storage and distribution of water, but now broken and collapsed with its platform riven and sunk, and covered with broken jars and earthen vessels, its water having been used up.
Ayodhya resembled a bow-string, which was large and bent, with suitable noose at
both ends, but severed from the bow by the arrows of heroes and fallen to the ground.
Ayodhya appeared like a mare, urged on suddenly by a horse-man, skilled in war-fare and fallen down when killed by the opposite army.
Sitting in the chariot, the glorious Bharata, the son of Dasaratha, spoke the
following words to the charioteer who was riding his excellent chariot:
"How is it that the deep and intensified sound of vocal and instrumental music is
not heard as before in Ayodhya today?"
"The intoxicating odour of spirituous liquor or the fragrance of floral garlands or the aroma of sandal and aloe-wood fumes, which used to be spread once on all sides, are not being wafted."
"O, Sumantra! I do not hear, as before, the sound of the horses, the sound of the
intoxicating elephants and the clattering of the great chariots in this city now."
"Rama, having left Ayodhya, the distressful youth are not making use of the perfumes like sandal-wood, aloe wood as also the most admirable and fresh floral garlands."
"In the city afflicted by Rama's desertion, people are not going out for
pleasure-trips, wearing colourful garlands nor festivals are observed by them."
"The lustre of Ayodhya has departed along with my brother. It is certain. This
Ayodhya is not shining indeed, like a rainy night at the time of the waning moon."
"When will my brother return, like a carnival, diffusing joy in Ayodhya, as do the autumnal rains?"
"The highways in Ayodhya are not glittering with youthful people, richly attired,
bearing themselves bravely and roaming about in groups."
Thus speaking in many ways, Bharata entered his father's house, bereft of that
emperor and which resembled a cave bereft of a lion.
Bharata, though a composed man himself, shed tears by seeing that entire empty
gynaecium, looking like a day without the sun with its relinquished radiance.On that very night those messengers entered the city; Bharata also had experienced an unpleasant dream.
Bharata, the son of Dasaratha the paramount sovereign, after seeing that unpleasant dream just at the dawn of that night, felt very much anguished.
Knowing Bharata to have been in anguish, his graceful speaking friends arranged
recitation of stories in the palace; so as to erase his anguish.
Some played musical instruments for bringing about peacefulness. Likewise some
others arranged for exhibition of dramas and some others told various types of jokes.
That high-soled Bharata born in Raghu Dynasty could not be made cheerful by his
gently speaking friends by stage-plays or jokes.
A close friend spoke to Bharata, who was surrounded by his companions, as follows, "O, friend! Why are you not rejoicing, even when entertained by your friends?"
Bharata replied to the friend who spoke thus, as follows "You listen to me the
reason for which this depression came to me"
"I have seen a dream in which my father with his soiled body and with his hair
disheveled, was falling from the top of a mountain into a polluted pond defiled with cow dung.
"He was seen by me, as he was floating in that pond defiled with cow dung, drinking an oil through his hollowed palms and laughing again and again"
"Thereafter, having eaten cooked rice mixed with gingelly seeds repeatedly, with his head bent down and with his whole body smeared with oil, he plunged into the oil itself "I saw in the dream, the ocean dry up, the moon fall on the ground, the earth molested as if covered by darkness, a tusk of an elephant (on which the monarch rode) broken to pieces, a blazing fire suddenly extinguished, the earth riven, the various trees dry up, and the mountains whirl up into a mist."
"I saw my father in the dream, wearing black clothes, sitting on a stool made of
iron and women with black and reddish brown complexion deriding the king."
"My father, the virtuous man, adorned with red garlands and his body besmeared with sandal paste and seated in a chariot drawn by asses, proceeded hurriedly towards the south."
"I saw an ugly faced female demon, wearing red colored clothes, laughingly dragging away the king.
"This fearful dream was seen thus by me during that night. I myself or the king or Lakshmana may die."
"If in a dream, a person sees a man going in a chariot, yoked with donkeys, the
smoke of a funeral pyre will soon be seen ascending him."
"For this reason, I have become broken hearted. Hence, I am not able to treat you
properly. My throat seems to be drying up. My mind is not at ease."
"I do not see the root cause of this fear. But I am experiencing a fear indeed. My voice is choked. My luster is affected. I abhor me myself and I do not see a reason for it."
"That great fear is not going away from my heart, having seen such a course of this bad dream in varied forms and which dream was not imagined by me earlier and also reflecting on that inconceivable sight of the king."Having brought his mothers back to Ayodhya; Bharata, fixed in his resolve but sore stricken with grief, spoke to Vasishta and the elders (as follows)
"I am going to Nandigrama village. I take leave of all of you. There, I shall be
able to endure all this woe, occasioned by Rama's absence."
"The king Dasaratha went to heaven. My elder brother is in the forest. I shall await for Rama to return to the kingdom; since verily he alone is the celebrated Lord of Ayodhya."
Hearing those auspicious words of the magnanimous Bharata, Vasishta the preceptor
and all the ministers spoke as follows:
"O, Bharata! The words which your have spoken by you in devotion to your brother are very much appreciable. It is worthy of you alone."
"What man would not approve of the proposal of your highness, who are deeply
fascinated of your relative, always affectionate to your brother and devoted to the path of elders?"
Hearing the affectionate words of his counsellors, who spoke according to his wish, Bharata said to his charioteer, "Let my chariot be made ready!"
The illustrious Bharata, looking pleased and having offered salutation to all his
mothers, entered his chariot along with Shatrughna.
Both Shatrughna and Bharata, having quickly mounted the chariot and exceedingly
rejoiced, set out, accompanied by ministers and family-priests.
All the preceptors there, headed by Vasishta and other brahmanas being in the
forefront, proceeded eastward, in which direction Nandigrama village was situated.
When Bharata had left, the army too, abounding in elephants, horses and chariots
marched unbidden. The residents of the city also followed suit.
The magnanimous Bharata, affectionate of his brother, bearing the sandals belong to Rama on his head, set out for Nandigrama.
Thereafter, having entered Nandigrama briskly Bharata descended his chariot quickly and spoke to his preceptors as follows:
"My brother, Rama has given to me this kingdom as a trust. These sandals,
embellished with gold diffuse gain and security to the people."
Having dedicated the sacred trust to the wooden sandals, Bharata sore-stricken with anguish, spoke to the entire body of his ministers as follows:
"Hold the state canopy speedily over these wooden sandals, which have been accepted as symbols of the feet of Rama, my noble brother. By the presence of these wooden sandals of my brother here, a piety has been established in the kingdom."
"As a mark of compassion, this trust has been placed at my disposal, by my brother. There trust as such will be preserved till his return."
"Having restored these wooden sandals personally to Rama's feet immediately after
his return, I shall behold those feet of Rama along with these sandals."
"Restoring the kingdom to my elder brother, when re-united with him and thereby
laying down the burden, I shall then assume the role of a servant of my elder brother."
"By giving away these excellent wooden sandals, the symbols of trust, this kingdom, as well as the City of Ayodhya to Rama, I shall be washed of all my sins."
"Rama will be installed and his subjects made happy. It will be a four-fold more
fame and happiness for me than that having obtained from the kingdom."
The highly illustrious Bharata though a distressed man, thus lamenting and pained, looked after the state administration along with his ministers from Nandigrama.
Assuming bark robes and matted locks in the guise of an ascetic, the lord and the
hero Bharata dwelt in Nandigrama, protected by the army.
Bharata, obedient to his elder brother, affectionate of his brothers and faithful to his vow, thus resided in Nandigrama, coronating the wooden sandals on the throne and wishing always for the return of Rama.
Reporting all the royal orders to the wooden sandals, Bharata was holding the royal canopy together with the chowrie to those sandals.
Coronating the wooden sandals of his elder brother, the illustrious Bharata
thereafter carried out the state administration, always maintaining his subservience to them.
Whatever a small affair of the state came up or whenever a high-valued gift was
offered, Bharata used to report that matter to the wooden sandals and then only dealt with it in the proper way afterwards.When Rama thus kept silent after uttering those meaningful words as aforesaid, the pious Bharata for his part addressed to virtuous Rama who was fond of people conformable to justice at the banks of that River Mandakini.
"Who, in this world, is endowed with such qualities like you, O annihilator of
enemies! Neither does sorrow disturb you nor does joy enrapture you. You are highly honoured by elders and you clarify your doubts from them.
"By what should he be moved, who looks on life and death, misfortune or prosperity with an equal eye?"
"O, King! He who knows the totality of time as you do, ought not to feel despondent even on meeting with adversity."
"O, the magnanimous Rama! you are equally strong as celestials. You are true to your promise, all-knowing, all-viewing and endowed with understanding."
"Even the most fearful calamity ought not to attack you, endowed as you are, with
such attributes; and recognising the birth and end of all beings."
"The sinful deed, committed by my mean mother for my sake during my absence, was not to my liking. (Hence) be gracious to me."
"I am bound by the chanins of morality. For that reason, I do not kill iwth a severe punishment, my mother who was of perverse conduct and worthy of retribution."
"How can I, born of Dasaratha of noble birth and deeds and conversant of right and wrong, do the most wicked and horrible act?"
"The King Dasaratha was my preceptor, had several sacrificial performances to his
credit was aged, was my father, equal to a deity and is now dead. Hence, I cannot reproach him in an open assembly."
"O Rama the knower of piety! What man who knows the principles of righteousness,
would commit such an improper act, bereft of one's interest and duty, in order just to please a woman?"
"There is an ancient saying that at the time of death, beings lose their judgment. The king, acting as he did, has made this saying indeed true in the eyes of the world."
"This transgression of righteousness was done by our father for fear of anger (of
kaikeyi) or through infatuation and over-haste. You do keep in view a noble purpose and reverse that transgression."
"A son who honours only a good deviation (from righteousness) of a father is
accepted as a real son in this world. He who acts otherwise than this would be facing a quite reverse situation."
"You be that real son. Do not lend yourself to the infamous act, committed by our
father, which in this world, confident men freely condemn."
"Save Kaikeyi and me, our father, our friends, our relatives, all the urbanites and the villagers as well as the entire kingdom."
"Where is the forest and where is the princely dignity? Where is the matted hair and where is the protection of a kingdom? You ought not to do such a contradictory act."
"O, the highly enlightened hero! The first duty of a warrior is indeed to get
crowned, so that he may then protect his subjects."
"Which man of warrior-caste would set aside his manifest duty and prctise a virtue that gives doubtful result, which does not promise happiness, which has a mental restraint and which is uncertain?"
"If you desire to pursue a virtue alone; although born of pain, then take pains
while protecting the four castes as per tradition, by recourse to righteousness."
"O, Rama the knower of righteousness! The knower of what is right indeed tell that the life of a house-holder is the noblest of all the four* stages of life. How can you abandon it?"
"I am indeed junior to you in the point of learning, situation and by birth. How
should I rule the earth, while still you are living?"
"I, a mere child, who am devoted of intelligence and virtues besides placed in an
inferior position, cannot even live without you."
"O, Rama the knower of righteousness! Rule this entire kingdom belonging to your
father, without distraction, without hindrance and as per the conduct prescribed for you along with your relatives."
"Let all the king's ministers along with Vasishta and other priests well-versed in sacred formulas, crown you, the knower of sacred texts, here itself."
"You, having been crowned thus, may proceed to Ayodhya along with us to rule it,
like Indra the Lord of celestials, having conquered all the worlds with his might, proceeds to his kingdom along with celestials."
"You shall discharge the three obligations subdue all the enemies, gratify the
wishes of all your friends and you alone rule me in Ayodhya."
"O, noble brother! May your friends rejoice today at your enthronement. May your
enemies, full of terror, flee today to the ten quarters."
"O, excellent among men! Wipe off my mother's curse today and protect our venerable father from his sin."
"I request you by bowing my head before you. Show compassion on me and on all our
relatives as Lord Shiva ( the Supreme Deity) on all beings."
"Else if you disregard my entire request and move again into the forest form here, I too will go along with you."
Even while being propitiated by Bharata as above, by bowing his head duly sinking in his spirit, the illustrious Rama, the Lord of the earth was still abiding in the words of his father and did not feel inclined to return to Ayodhya.
Seeing that wonderful staunchness in Rama, the people of Ayodhya felt sorrowful and at the same time, experienced joy. They became distressed that he was not going to Ayodhya and felt rejoiced to see his firmness of resolve.
The priests, citizens and elders of that multitude as well as Queens, distracted and weeping bitterly, acclaimed Bharat who was then speaking thus, duly prostrating himself before Rama and added theri supplications to Rama.Bharata rose up at day-break, mounted on excellent chariot and went quickly with a desire to see Rama.
All the ministers and priests ascended, chariots yoked with horses, resembling those of the sun, and went ahead of Bharata.
Nine thousand elephants suitably duly arranged escorted Bharata the joy of the
Ikshvaku dynasty, on his journey.
Sixty thousand chariots filled with archers, furnished with weapons of various
kinds, followed the illustrious prince Bharata.
A hundred thousand cavalry accompanied the moving Bharata, born in Raghu dynasty,
who was true to his promise and who subdued his senses.
Kaikeyi, Sumitra and the illustrious Kausalya rode in a resplendent chariot,
delighted as they were at the thought of Rama's return.
The whole body of noble men with their jubiliant hearts followed Bharata to see Rama again as also Lakshmana, recounting the marvelous exploits of that hero to each other saying:
"When shall we see the mighty armed prince, of the hue of dark cloud, whose courage is unshakable, of inflexible purpose Rama, who banished sorrow from the earth?"
"Beholding Rama, our entire sorrow will indeed be dispelled, as darkness of the
entire earth is dispelled at the rising of the sun."
Thus did the citizens of Ayodhya recount happily of Rama's glorious deeds, and they embraced each other as they went along.
Those others who were held in high esteem, merchants and all common people proceeded merrily to join Rama.
Some lapidaries, skilled potters, those who lived by manufacture of arms,
carpenters, those who made various articles from peacock-feather, sawyers, workers in artificial ornaments, those who pierced gems, pearls etc, those who made articles of ivory, those who lived by perfumery, highly reputed goldsmiths, weavers of blankets and other wollen goods, those who provided hot-water baths for other, physicians, distillers and vendors of spirituous liquors, fumigators, washer-men, tailors, chiefs of villages and hamlets, dancers with their women-folk and fishermen started on the journey.
Thousands of Brahmanas, well-composed, renowned for their virtuous conduct, versed in sacred scriptures and riding on bullock-carts, accompanied Bharata.
All of them, attired in clean and fair raiment, anointed with pure red sandal-paste, mounted on various kinds of vehicles, followed Bharata tranquilly.
Exceedingly pleased and cheerful, that army escorted the son of Kaikeyi- Bharta who was affectionate towards his brother and who had set out along with his family to bring his brother, Rama.
Having gone for a considerable distance in their chariots, carts, horses and
elephants, they reached the River Ganga close to the city of Shringaberapura, where the valiant Guha, a bosom friend of Rama along with multitude of relatives was ruling that region carefully. 
That army, which was accompanying Bharata, arrived at the bank of Ganga River,
looking beautiful as it was with Charka* birds and stopped there.
Seeing the army behind, which accompanied him and the River Ganga in front with its propitious waters, Bharata who was skillful in words, spoke to all his officers (as follows):
"It is my will that my army should take rest by all means. When they are refreshed we shall cross the river tomorrow."
"Meanwhile, descending into the river, I desire to make offering of the sacred water as libation for the infinite spirit relating to the state after death, to the king Dasaratha who has gone to heaven."
Hearing these words from Bharata, the officers attentively answered, "Be it so" and each of them encamped their respective forces in accord with his pleasure.
Having meticulously arranged for encampment of the army which looked lovely along
Ganga that great river with the surrounding equipment (like tunts, furnishings etc), Bharata halted then, reflecting as to how to bring back the magnanimous Rama.Rama along with Lakshmana, his younger brother, began to question Bharata, his
brother who was devoted to elders (as follows):
"I desire to hear from you, why you have come tot his place in robes of bark and an antelope-skin."
"You ought to tell me all about the purpose for which you entered this place, clad in deer-skin and matted hair, relinquishing the kingdom."
Thus questioned by the high souled Rama, by closely embracing him again, Bharata
with joined palms answered as follows:
"O, noble brother! Our father the mighty armed, after performing a deed must
difficult to perform, and having abandoned us has gone the divine region; he died of grief on account of separation from his son."
"O, tormented of foes! As urged by his wife and my mother Kaikeyi;, our father
committed this great sin that has taken away his own reputation."
"Without having plucked the fruit of kingdom, widowed and emaciated with grief my
mother will fall into the most terrific hell."
"Grant me, who am your true servant, a favour! This very day, as Indra the Lord of celestials himself, receive the royal anointing!"
"Grant all these people and these widowed Queens, who have come here to see you,
this felicity!"
"O, Prince! For that reason, accept the throne that is befitting; endowed to you as per succession and that is yours by right fulfill, as your should, the desires of your friends."
"Bring the widowhood of the entire world to an end by becoming her Lord, as does the immaculate moon to the autumn-night."
"Grant this grace to your brother, who prostrates at your feet along with your
ministers is both your discipline and your slave."
"O, Tiger among men! You cannot disregard this unbroken kingdom, which is eternal, ancestral and honoured."
Thus speaking, the mighty armed Bharata, with tears, once again seized Rama's feet in great honour, as per precept.
Rama embraced his brother Bharata, who sighed again and again like an elephant in
rut, and spoke as follows:-
"How should a man of noble birth, rich in Sattva (goodness), dignified and who has observed sacred vows like myself, commit sin for the sake of a mere kingdom?"
"O, Bharata the annihilator of enemies! I do not see the slightest fault in you and you should not reproach your mother for a childish action."
"O, Bharata the highly intelligent and the faultless man! It is incumbent always on the part of the elders to act freely with reference to their wives and progeny."
"O, gentle brother! Since it was said thus by virtuous men in this world, we should all, women children and disciples, obey our Lord; this must be known to you."
"The great king is the master, who has a discretion either to make me reside in the forest, wearing bark robes and a black antelope skin or to sit on the throne, O gentle brother!"
"O, excellent among the supporters of law and the virtuous! The same degree of
respect is to be paid to our mother, as is due to our father, who is honoured by all."
"How can I do otherwise, while both my parents of virtuous nature ask me to go to
the forest?"
"It is for you to occupy the throne in Ayodhya that the world reveres and it is for me to occupy this Dandaka forest, wearing bark robes."
"Having commanded thus, the emperor Dasaratha with a great splendour, made the
division of duties in this manner (for us two) in the presence of the people and then ascended to heaven."
"That pious souled king, the preceptor of the world is the standard authority for
you and you have to enjoy the share given by our father accordingly."
"I, for my part, shall enjoy the share given to me by our high-souled father for
fourteen years, taking my abode in Dandaka forest, O gentle brother!"Having seen Bharadwaja's hermitage at a couple of miles away, that excellent man
Bharata, knowing what is right, leaving all his army behind, discarding his weapons and ornaments, and wearing simple silken garment, went forwards by foot, proceeded by Vasishta, his spiritual preceptor.
Leaving his ministers behind at a visible distance to Bharadwaja, Bharata then went along with Vasishta, his spiritual preceptor.
On seeing Vasishta, Bharadwaja the great ascetic rose quickly from his seat, asking his disciples to fetch water to wash the hand (of the distinguished guests) with.
Having met Vasishta and greeted by Bharata, Bharadwaja of great splendour recognized him to be a son of Dasaratha.
Bharadwaja, knowing what is right, offering them both, in order of seniority, water to wash theri hands and feet with and fruits afterwards, made enquiries concerning the welfare of their family.
Subsequently, Bharadwaja made enquires with both of them as to whether all were well in the city of Ayodhya, with the army, with the treasury, friends and counsellors. But knowing Dasaratha friends and counsellors. But knowing Dasaratha to be dead, he did not speak of the king.
Vasishta and Bharata in return made enquires with Bharadwaja, if all were well with his body his sacred fires, his disciples, the trees, the deer and birds in the hermitage.
The great ascetic Bharadwaja replied, "All is well" and spoke the following words to Bharata, bound as he was with affection to Rama.
"For what reason have you, who are ruling the kingdom, come here? Tell me all this, for my mind is not getting cleared of doubts."
"That annihilator of enemies, born of Kausalya for the increase of her happiness, he who with his brother and his wife have been exiled to the forest for a long period, that Rama who is full of glory, through the intrigues of a woman was condemned to dwell in the forest for fourteen years by his father. I hope you do not intend to do any harm to that irreproachable prince and his younger brother in order to enjoy the throne without hindrance."
"Thus spoken to as aforesaid, Bharata with his eyes filled with tears in grief and in a faltering tone, replied to Bharadwaja as follows:
"If you the Blessed One, regard me like this, I am lost indeed! I cannot conceive of any harm towards Rama having proceeded from me. do not charge me thus."
" I do not approve of what my mother has done when I was away from home. I am not
pleased with her nor do I accept her word in this matter."
"I, on my part, came to take back that tiger among men to Ayodhya, after prostrating myself at his feet and having propitiated him."
"O, venerable one! Believing me to have come for the aforesaid purpose, you ought to do a favour for me. Tell me where Rama the Lord of the world is to be found now?"
Requested by Vasishta and other priests likewise, Bharadwaja answered Bharata in
affectionate words as follows:
"O, Bharata the tiger among men! Good manners towards teachers as well as self
control and walking in the footsteps of virtuous men-these qualities are worthy of you, born as you are in the Raghu dynasty."
" I was aware of your purpose in your mind. But, I desired to confirm it and it is on this account that I asked you, in order to strengthen you fame immeasurably."
"I know where the virtuous Rama along with Seetha and LakSmana are to be found. Your elder brother is staying on the great mountain called Chitrakuta."
"You may proceed to that place tomorrow. Stay here today along with your ministers. O, man of great wisdom, who understands legitimate interest and desire! Grant me this desire."
Bharata of a broad outlook and whose reality (as an admirer of Rama) had now come to be known, answered thus: "So be it". Then, the prince made up his mind to stay for that night in the hermitage."That brilliant and glorious Bharata, who was a rejoice to Ikshvaku dynasty marching in easterly direction from the city of Rajagriha, thereafter observing and crossing Sudama* river as well as the wide Hladini river, whose stream flowed towards eastern direction.
The pure and illustrious Bharata, who kept up his promise, crossing shatradru river at Eladhana village, reaching the region of Apara parpata, crossing a rocky hill called akurvati, seeing the villages of Agneyam and salyakartana as well as Silavaha river, crossed huge mountains and traveled towards the woods of Chitraratha.
Arriving at the confluence of Saraswati and Ganga rivers, Bharata entered the woods of Bharmuda, the north of Viramatsaya region.
Reaching and crossing a refreshing river named Kulinga, which is swift and
surrounded by mountains as well as Yamuna river, the army was then made to rest there.
Making cool the limbs of the tired horses by bathing there and cheering up them,
nay, taking a bath himself, drinking some water and carrying it for future use, Bharata proceeded further.
The blessed prince Bharata traversed that rarely frequented huge forest by his
excellent chariot as the wind glides through an atmosphere.
Bharata soon reached the great river, Bharathi, which is difficult to be crossed, at the city of pragvata in the region of Amsudhana.
Crossing the River Ganga at the city of Pragvata, he reached the river
Kulikoshthika, traversed it along with his army and then arrived at the region of
Dharmavardhana.
Bharata reached Jambuprasta village, which is located at the southern part of Torana region and from there he arrived at a beautiful village too, named Varutha.
Making a camp in thatbeautiful forest there, Bharata traveled towards the east and reached a garden in the city of Ujjihana, in which there are a number of Kadamba trees.
Having reached Sala and Kadamba trees, Bharata yoked swifter horses to his chariot, allowed his army to come after him and quickly went ahead.
Having halted min Sarvatirtha village and having crossed Uttamika river and various other rivers by mountain -ponies and reaching Hast prasthaka village, Bharata crossed Kutika river and traversed kapivati river at Lohitya village.
Bharata, after crossing Sthanumati river at Ekasala village and Gomati river at
Vinata village, took rest at a grove of Sala trees at Kalinga city as the horses were very much tired and then proceeded quickly.
Driving through grove quickly in the night, Bharata at the dawn saw the city of
Ayodhya, which was earlier built by King Manu.
Seeing the city of Ayodhya in front, after spending seven nights on his way, Bharata the tiger among men, spoke the following words to his charioteer:
"O, Charioteer! The famous city of Ayodhya comes into view vaguely to me from a
distance, as a heap of white clay. It has beautiful gardens. It is filled with performers of sacrifices and with people endowed with good qualities as well as well versed in the Vedas and with Brahmins inmost abundant reaches , It is being ruled by a royal sage."
Earlier , a big clattering voice of men and women used to be heard all round in
Ayodhya. Now, I am not hearing that voice."
"The parks which used to beam with men streaming forth on all sides, having given up sporting in the morning after entering them in thee evening having spent the whole night in sport, now appear to me otherwise"
"These parks deserted by the lovers now turn out to be dejected . O, charioteer! To me, the city appears to have changed into a forest."
"Here, as before, important persons indeed are not seen going into the city or
coming out it in carriages or on horses or on elephants."
"Earlier parks used to be conspicuously excited with joy and gaiety and were most
congenial for love contacts of men."
"I am seeing the same parks., today with lack of enjoyments on all sides and with
trees having their leaves fallen along the road, looking like picture of dismay."
"Even now at dawn, charming sounds with sweet and much melodious tone of animals and birds intoxicated with happiness are not being heard."
"Why does, as before, pure and auspicious breeze laden with aloes and sandal wood
intensified with the fume of burnt incense,not blow today.?"
"Why today have the sounds of kettledrums, clay tomtoms and Vinas played upon with drum-sticks or palms or fingers stopped which formerly never ceased at any time."
"I perceive various kinds of evil sinful and silly omens and by this, my mind is
dejected."
"O, charioteer! It is not possible that all sounds be well with my kinsfolk, as
indeed, even without anycause for a grievance, my spirit is cast down"
Despondent, distressed in mind, frightened and extremely entered the city, which was ruled by the descendents of Ikshvaku.
Bharata, with his tiered horses entered the city through Vaijayanta gate. Greeted
with slogans of victory by the standing gatekeepers, he went inside, along with others.
Bharata, with a distracted mind, responded to the salutations of those porters at
the gate and those porters at the gate and spoke to the charioteer who was beloved to Asvapati as follows:
"O, the faultless charioteer! Why was I brought so quickly without any reason? My
mind is apprehending some evil. I lost my all energy."
"Whatever things were heard by us formerly in the same case of ruin of kings, I am seeing here all those signs."
"I am seeing the family horses in which dirt is not swept away, with their doors
wide open, bereft of splendor on all sides without any offerings being made, and with no incense burned . Families are starving and people look miserably without any charming appearance."
"The temples of gods are deserted and have lost their radiance, with their splendor of floral decorations lost, nor are there any assembling to perform sacrifices as before."
"Worships of the deities were placed aside. Assemblies of prayers are also not
adorned with saleable flowers and garlands today."
"Even traders lost interest in trading tie-ups and their minds are tied up in
thoughts. They are not being seen here today, as before."
"Clusters of birds in temples and large trees in the city are looking desolate. The population of men and women in the city look thoughtful anguished weak messy and despondent with their eyes held in tears."
After seeing those bad omens in Ayodhya, the broken hearted Bharata spoke to the
charioteer as aforesaid and went to the royal palace.
Beholding the city of Ayodhya,that formerly possessed the splendor of the capital
city of Indra, now with its squares houges and high ways deserted, the doors and hinges covered with rust , Bharata was overcome with grief.
Seeing many things disenchanted to mind which did not occur at any time before in
the city, the high soled Bharata with his head bent down and with his mind miserable gloomily entered his father's house.Bharata endowed with understanding, saw that assembly, enriched with the whole body of respectable men, looking like a night in full moon duly enriched with well-known planets.
That excellent assembly was aglow with the brilliance of clothes and scented
cosmetics of its respected members occupying their appropriate seats.
That beautiful assembly filled with learned men looked like a night with autumn full moon.
Beholding all the entire body of ministers of the king, Vaishta the knower of
righteousness uttered to Bharata the following soft-spoken words:
"O, beloved Bharata! The king Dasaratha, practicing righteousness, gave away to you this wide earth endowed with grains and riches and went to heaven."
"Rama, who was firmly established in truth, remembering the righteousness of good
men, did not abandon the command of his father, as a raising moon does not abandon the
moon-light."
"The kingdom, having its enemies destroy was given to you by your father and
brother. Enjoy it, with its delightful ministers. Get anointed for the kingdom just soon."
"let those living in the north, the Westerners; the southerners the kings of western borders near the Sahya mountains who are without a throne and the seafaring traders bring crores of jewels as gifts to you."
Hearing those words, the pious Bharata was filled with distress and thirsting for
justice got his mind fixed on Rama.
The youthful Bharata, with a voice of a Hamsa bird, in the midst of the assembly,
lamented in a tearful and appealing speech. He even reproached his royal priest as follows:
"How can a man such as I, rob the throne from one, who practices Brahmacharya
(continence and chastity), versed in the science of the Vedas (sacred scriptures) and who is devoted to duty?"
"How should one born of Dasaratha become the usurper of a crown? Both the kingdom
and I myself belong to Rama. You ought to tell the law and justice in this matter."
"Rama, the eldest son, an excellent man, a pious souled and who can be compared with Dilipa and Nahusha, is eligible to get the kingdom, as with Dasaratha."
"If in this world, I dishonoured the name of Ikshavaku race, I should be guilty of a sinful act, practiced by disgraceful men, which does not lead to heaven."
"I do not indeed like that sinful act done even by my mother. From here itself, I
offer my salutation with my joined palms to Rama who is residing in an impassable forest."
"I will follow Rama's steps. He, who is supreme among men, is the king. Rama is
eligible even for the kingdom of the three worlds."
Hearing those righteous words of Bharata, all the members of the assembly shed tearsof joy, having their minds obsessed of Rama.
"If I am unable to bring back my elder brother from the forest, I shall stay back in that forest itself, as how the venerable Lakshmana is staying now."
"I shall use every means to bring back compulsorily, that hero before you,
practicing virtues, the honourable and the distinguished men."
"All those who are skilled in clearing paths working on and without wages, have been sent by me in advance and the journey so planned, pleases me."
The pious minded Bharata, who had an affection for his brother spoke as aforesaid
and uttered the following words to Sumantra who was clever in giving counsel and who was sitting nearby.
"O, Sumantra! Rise quickly and go. As per my orders, arrange for the jorney
immediately. Bring the army also."
Hearing the words of the magnanimous Bharata, Sumantra joyfully arranged all that in accord with Bharata's orders and wishes.
Hearing about the expedition of the army too; for arranging of return of Rama, the ministers and army-commander there were delighted.
All the wives of warriors in every house, knowing about the ensuing expedition, were jubiliant and hurried up all their respective husband to setoff for the journey.
Those army-generals urged the entire army to march forward quickly, with the fast
moving horses, bullock carts with a good speed and the chariots along with the warriors.
Seeing that army ready, Bharata in the presence of Vasishta said as follows to
Sumantra who was standing by his side: "Get ready my chariot quickly."
Bowing to the command of Bharata and taking a chariot yoked with excellent horses, Sumantra on his part approached him with delight.
Bharata, born in Raghu dynasty who was sincere in his purpose a powerful man having strong and mighty prowess and whose talk was most appropriate, then spoke as follows: intending (to undertake a journey) to persuade his illustrious elder brother, staying in dreary woods, to return to Ayodhya.
"O, Sumantra! Rise up and proceed quickly to inform the army-chief to arrange for
the troops. After propitiating that Rama staying in the forest, I want to bring him back to Ayodhya for the welfare of the people."
Sumantra, having received that explicit command from Bharata, which fulfilled his
highest hopes, called all the ministers-in-chief, the chiefs of the army and the friendly multitude.
Thereupon, from every house, warriors merchants, Shudras and Brahmanas rose up and harnessed their chariots to camels, mules, well-bred elephants and horses.Hearing that his father was dead and both his brothers were exiled; Bharata was
tormented with grief and spoke the following words:
Bereft of my father as well as my brother too, who is exactly like my father, what is the use of a kingdom now to me, lamenting as I am with despair?"
"Making Dasaratha to die and turning Rama to be an ascetic, you brought one calamity after another like sprinkling salt on a wound."
"You came for destruction of our race, like the night of destruction coming at the end of the world. My father could not be aware of his embracing a live char-coal to his bosom."
"O, the malevolent woman! You caused the death of my father. O, the one who made our race unchaste! In this race, happiness is deserted through your ignorance."
"My father, king Dasaratha, who was true to his promise and immensely famous, now
died, tormented as he was with bitter grief, because of you."
"Why did you kill my father the monarch, who was intent on righteousness? Why did
you send Rama on exile to the forest?"
"It is impossible that Kausalya and Sumitra, who are afflicted with grief for their sons, will live in fellowship with you, my mother."
"Even Rama my elder brother, a pious man who knows how to behave with elders, used to act with the best behavior in your case, exactly as how he was behaving with his own mother."
"In the same manner, Kausalya, my elder mother having far sightedness and
established in piety, indeed used to behave with you as your sister."
"Why are you not lamenting, after sending Rama, the disciplined Kausalya 's son,
clothed in a bark dress, to live in a forest? O, sinful one!"
"You indeed sent into exile, clad in a bark dress, Rama having a virtuous
disposition, a valiant man, a self controlled and illustrious man as he was. What reason do you gather for it?"
"I think it is not known to you, a greedy woman, about my devotion towards Rama. It is exactly so. You have brought in this great calamity for the sake of a kingdom."
"By which source of strength can I be able to protect the kingdom, without those
lions among men, Rama and Lakshmana in proximity to me?"
"Dasaratha the monarch, having great strength and a pious mind always indeed used to take refuge in that strong man Rama as the Meru mountain takes refuge in a forest surrounding the mountain."
"By what stamina, shall I sustain this burden of kingship any more than a young
bullock that is yet to be tamed, would stand the strain on getting a load, lifted up with ease by a giant bullock."
"Or even if a strength can be brought into existence in me by following certain
suitable methods or by strength of intelligence, I will not allow you, who are greedy in fetching of kingdom for your son, to fulfill your desire."
"No aversion would be felt by me even to desert you, a woman of evil designs, if
Rama did not treat you like a mother at all times."
"O, malevolent woman with your good conduct disappeared! How this idea forbidden by our ancestors, has arisen in your mind at all?"
"The eldest of all in this race should be indeed anointed as a king. The rest of his brothers are to behave reverently towards their elder brother."
"O, cruel woman! I feel that you are not catching even a glimpse of the rules
relating to kings or not even aware of a permanent procedure prevailing in the administration of kings."
"According to the administration of kings the eldest son always indeed gets
inaugurated in kingdom. This procedure is similar to all kings; especially so in the case of Ikshvaku kings."
"The pride of reputation of those belonging to Ikshvaku race, who protect
righteousness alone and who possessed good family conduct, is turned away by you today."
"Even kings belonging to your ancestral race were great people. How has this
contemptible stupidity of mind born in you?"
"O, woman with evil designs! I for one will not fulfill your desire. A criminal act, which will cause even an end to my life, has been undertaken by you."
"Now itself at the cause of your dislike, I for one will bring back from the forest, my brother, who is a faultless man and a beloved man of his people."
"Bringing back Rama with a very firm mind, I will become a servant to him, who is
radiant with glory."
Speaking as aforesaid, the high soled Bharata, pricking her with a multitude of
unpleasant words, roared again like a lion stationed in a mountain cave.While those lions among men amidst a host of friends were lamenting, that night
elapsed with a much difficulty.
When the beautiful dawn broke, Rama's brothers along with their companions, having made their offerings and recited their prayers on the banks of River Madakini, approached Rama.
Sitting in silence, no one uttered a word. Bharata, on his part, amidst his
companions, addressed Rama as follows:
"My mother has been consoled (by you) by giving this kingdom to me. I am giving back that kingdom to you. Enjoy it without hindrance!"
"As a dam breached by a great on-rush of water during a rainy season cannot be
repaired so easily, this great continent cannot be defended by any one other than you."
"As a donkey cannot emulate the tempo of a horse, or an ordinary bird the movement of Garuda (a kind of falcon), neither can I follow in your footsteps, O, Lord of the world!"
"O, Rama! Know his life to be blessed forever, on whom others depend Life is,
however, difficult for him who depends on others for this life."
"As a tree planted by a man may grow and with its great branches and immense trunk, become inaccessible to a dwarf, yet though it may come to flowering, does not bear fruit, it yeilds no pleasure for him. O, mighty armed! You ought to understand the import of theis simile and being the distinguished Lord of all, may you guide us, your sevants!"
"O, emperor, the conqueror of foes! May all behold you, shining resplendent on all sides like the sun, seated on the throne!"
"O, Rama! May the elephants, intoxicated with ichor be heard trumpeting on the
highway, when you do return and the women of the inner apartments rejoice, all happily joined together."
Hearing the words of Bharata, who was thus appealing to Rama, the various people of the city in approbation, said "Excellent! Well said!"
On seeing the illustrious and sorrowful Bharata thus lamenting, the prudent and
self-conposed Rama began to console him as follows:
"Man is not able to do what he wills. He is not the Master A fixed form or name
drives him hither and thither."
"All that is piled up, is finally disbursed. What rises, ends in a fall. Unio ends in separation. Life ends in death."
"How a ripe fruit does not fear for anything other than its falling, so also a man once born, does not fear for anything other than his death."
"As a house that is solidly contructed ultimately falls into decay, human being too is subject to age and death."
"The night that has passed, does not return and the buntiful River Yamuna just
marches on towards the all-sufficient abounding in water."
"The pasing days and nights in this world quickly decrease the life-span of all
living being as in the summer, the rays of the sun dry up the water (in a pool)."
"You grieve for yourself. Why do you grieve for another? Even while you stay at
home, or departed to another place, your life-span gets shortened."
"Death walks just with us (as we walk) and sits with us (as we sit). Having
travelled a very long distance (with us), death returns along with us (as we return)."
"When folds have appeared on limbs and hair have turned grey; on what expedient can a man having got decayed with age, come back to the original splendour?"
"People are deligted when the sun has risen and also when the day ends. But they are not able to perceive the waning in their life-span."
"Seeing the onset of season, people rejoice, as though it has come something newly. But the succession of the seasons devours the life of being."
"As pieces of drift-wood floating on the ocean coe toghether for a span, so wives, children, kinsmen wealth and property come together for a while and part with us. Their parting in deed inevitable."
"Here, no being can escape its destiny ( in the form of birth and death). For that reason, the power to avert his own death does not ingrain in a man mourning for a dead person."
"As a caravan is passing on a road, one stationed at the way-side says, I too will come behind you. In the same manner, we should inevitably follow the path taken by fathers and fire fathers. Why a man who obtained that path, for which there is no return, distress himself.
"While the age reshes on, without any return like a flowing river, one's self should be emplyoed in a pursuit leading to blessedness. It is said that beings are meant to be happy?"
"The king Dasaratha, our pious minded father performed almost all auspicious
sacrifices and paid plentiful sacrificial fees (to the officitaing preists and Brahmins) and went to heaven."
"Our father reached heaven because he maintained his servants properly, protected
his subjects and realised the taxes in the manner prescribed by scriptures from them."
"Our father, the king Dasaratha obtained heaven because of his auspicious acts and perfoming sacrifices involving heavy sacrificial fees."
"Having perfomed many types of sacrifices, enjoying worldly pleasure abundantly and having obtained a long and virtuous life, king Dasaratha reached heaven."
"O, dear brother! King Dasaratha, our father who was treated with respect by all
virtuous men and who secured excellent life-span and enjoyments, is not to be pitied."
"King Dasaratha, our father, having abandoned his worn-out human body, indeed has
attained the celstial state, by which he can stroll in the realm of Brahma (the highest heaven).
"No wise, learned and exceptionally clever man, would weep in such a manner, such as I and you, about the emperor.
"The wise, who are steadfast, should indeed relinquish these sorrows, lamentatious, weepings and such other states of misery."
"Be composed, O Most eloquent of orators! Control your grief, return to the City of Ayodhya in order to obey the command of our father, the subduer of his senses."
"I also will fulfil the command of our father, the venrable man in that very place, whre I have been ordered to stay by that king Dasaratha of virtuous deeds."
"O Bharata the Vanquisher of Foes! It is not justifiable for me to violate the
command of our father. You also must honour it to the end, for it comes from our father, out own blood."
"O, Bharata! Hence, I shall conform to the honourable word of our father, the
practiser of virtue, by my act of dwelling in the forest."
O, Tigher among men! Thus should a pious man act, who seeks to harm none, who is
obedient to his elders and who aspires to conquer the higher world."
"O, excellent among men! perceiving the virutous conduct of our father, the King
Dasaratha, act in conformity to your own nature."
Having uttered in about an hour, these meaningful words in this manner to his
younger brother on the need of abedience to his father's will, the magnamous and the mighty Rama became silent.Rama along with Lakshmana, his younger brother, began to question Bharata, his
brother who was devoted to elders (as follows):
"I desire to hear from you, why you have come tot his place in robes of bark and an antelope-skin."
"You ought to tell me all about the purpose for which you entered this place, clad in deer-skin and matted hair, relinquishing the kingdom."
Thus questioned by the high souled Rama, by closely embracing him again, Bharata
with joined palms answered as follows:
"O, noble brother! Our father the mighty armed, after performing a deed must
difficult to perform, and having abandoned us has gone the divine region; he died of grief on account of separation from his son."
"O, tormented of foes! As urged by his wife and my mother Kaikeyi;, our father
committed this great sin that has taken away his own reputation."
"Without having plucked the fruit of kingdom, widowed and emaciated with grief my
mother will fall into the most terrific hell."
"Grant me, who am your true servant, a favour! This very day, as Indra the Lord of celestials himself, receive the royal anointing!"
"Grant all these people and these widowed Queens, who have come here to see you,
this felicity!"
"O, Prince! For that reason, accept the throne that is befitting; endowed to you as per succession and that is yours by right fulfill, as your should, the desires of your friends."
"Bring the widowhood of the entire world to an end by becoming her Lord, as does the immaculate moon to the autumn-night."
"Grant this grace to your brother, who prostrates at your feet along with your
ministers is both your discipline and your slave."
"O, Tiger among men! You cannot disregard this unbroken kingdom, which is eternal, ancestral and honoured."
Thus speaking, the mighty armed Bharata, with tears, once again seized Rama's feet in great honour, as per precept.
Rama embraced his brother Bharata, who sighed again and again like an elephant in
rut, and spoke as follows:-
"How should a man of noble birth, rich in Sattva (goodness), dignified and who has observed sacred vows like myself, commit sin for the sake of a mere kingdom?"
"O, Bharata the annihilator of enemies! I do not see the slightest fault in you and you should not reproach your mother for a childish action."
"O, Bharata the highly intelligent and the faultless man! It is incumbent always on the part of the elders to act freely with reference to their wives and progeny."
"O, gentle brother! Since it was said thus by virtuous men in this world, we should all, women children and disciples, obey our Lord; this must be known to you."
"The great king is the master, who has a discretion either to make me reside in the forest, wearing bark robes and a black antelope skin or to sit on the throne, O gentle brother!"
"O, excellent among the supporters of law and the virtuous! The same degree of
respect is to be paid to our mother, as is due to our father, who is honoured by all."
"How can I do otherwise, while both my parents of virtuous nature ask me to go to
the forest?"
"It is for you to occupy the throne in Ayodhya that the world reveres and it is for me to occupy this Dandaka forest, wearing bark robes."
"Having commanded thus, the emperor Dasaratha with a great splendour, made the
division of duties in this manner (for us two) in the presence of the people and then ascended to heaven."
"That pious souled king, the preceptor of the world is the standard authority for
you and you have to enjoy the share given by our father accordingly."
"I, for my part, shall enjoy the share given to me by our high-souled father for
fourteen years, taking my abode in Dandaka forest, O gentle brother!"Bharata thanks Guha for having come forward to offer hospitality to him and his 
army. He enquires about the proper route to proceed to the hermitage of Bharadvaja. Guha assures Bharata that he along with some of his ferrymen will follow him as guides. When Guha enquires Bharata whether he has an evil intention towards Rama, Bharata clarifies him that he is proceeding to Rama?s place to bring him back to Ayodhya. When night falls Bharata along with Shatrughna and his army take rest. However Guha consoles Bharata, who has been constantly bewailing, till the nightfall.
Hearing those words, the highly intelligent Bharata replied toGuha, the lord of Nishadas, in words that were full of reason and meaning.
?O, friend of my elder brother! Indeed, your desire to offerhospitality to my army of such a magnitude, is great.?
Having spoken these excellent words to Guha; the greatlyillustrious Bharata, possessed of great splendor, said again to Guha the kingof Nishadas (as follows):
?O, Guha! By which of these two routes can I go to the hermitageof Bharadvaja? This region engulfed in waters of Ganga River is not very much easy to negotiate and is difficult to cross.?
Hearing the words of the wise prince; Guha, who roams about inwoods, with joined palms answered as follows:
?O highly illustrious prince! My ferrymen wielding their bows,and very attentive, will certainly accompany you. I too will follow you (inperson).?
?I hope you are not going to attack Rama, who is unwearied inaction. This great army of yours is begetting an apprehension in my mind.?
Bharata, whose heart resembled a taintless sky, spoke thefollowing words in smooth voice, to that Guha, who confessed his doubt asaforesaid.
?Let not such an occasion of wretchedness come! You should neverhave suspected me. That Rama my elder brother is indeed regarded as my father.?
?I am going to get back Rama who is now living in the forest. O,Guha! No other apprehension should be made by you. I am telling you the truth.?
Hearing the words of Bharata, Guha on his part, with his faceradiated with joy spoke again to Bharata as follows:
?You be blessed! I do not see your equal on this earth - you, whowish to renounce the empire you acquired now, even without effort.?
Assuredly your fame will traverse permanently in all provinces,as you are the very person who wishes to bring back Rama from his terribleplight.
While Guha was talking thus to Bharata, the sun diffused lesslight and the night fell.
The illustrious Bharata, lodging that army in camps, feltdelighted by Guha?s hospitality,returned to his camp and took rest along withShatrughna.
The high soled Bharata, whose only aim is to fulfill his duty andwho is undeserving of sorrow, indeed felt grief, born of anguish for Rama.
As a fire is hidden in a hollow tree while a forest is on fire, sodid Bharata?s fire of anguish burn with in his heart.
Perspiration born of fieriness of grief poured off from all hislimbs, as the snow heated by solar rays melts and flows from Himavat mountain.
Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi was pressed by the weight of thatcolossal mountain of agony consisting of rocky caverns in the shape of settledcontemplations on Rama, minerals in the shape of groans and sighs, a cluster oftrees in the shape of depressive thoughts, summits in the form of sufferingsand 
fatigue, countless wild beasts in the shape of swoons, herbs and bamboos inthe form of his exertions.
Thereafter, Bharata the excellent among men sighing much inmelancholy, his mind utterly confused in consequence, having obtained anextreme distress, afflicted as he was with burning fever in his breast and likea bull strayed from its herd, found no peace.
The noble soled Bharata, with his escort, met Guha too in acomposed mind. Then Guha slowly reassured Bharata again as regards his elderbrother.Reproaching Kaikeyi in that manner, Bharata again spoke the following words, wrapped as he was in great anger.
"O, Kaikeyi! The cruel and evil-mannered woman! Get lost from this kingdom. You
having abandoned righteousness, remain lamenting about me, who will be dead soon."
"What harm king Dasaratha or the highly righteous Rama have done to you so harshly that Dasaratha's death and Rama's exile have occurred at one and the same time because of you?"
"O, Kaikeyi! You got the sin of killing an embryo because of the destruction of this race. O, Kaikeyi! Go to hell .Do not get the residence in the same heaven as your husband."
"You have done this terrific act and committed such a great sin. By forsaking the
persons beloved by all, an alarm has been created in me also."
"My father died and Rama is dwelling in a forest, because of you. You got me ill
fame in this world of beings."
"Though in appearance you are my mother, you are inimical to me. You are a cruel
woman, greedy of kingdom. With evil conduct, you killed your husband. I should never speak to you."
"Kausalya, Sumitra and my other mothers are engrossed in a great misfortune, by
falling victim to you, who brought disgrace to our family."
"The righteous Rama, who is forever devoted to truth, was sent to the forest. Due to grief for his son, my father went to heaven. You do not seem to be the daughter of Asvapati, the pious and sensible king. You were born there as a demo ness, to destroy the house of my father."
"The aforesaid sin you have committed has made me father less. Besides, I have been abandoned by my brothers and all the people dislike me now."
"O, woman having evil desires, moving towards hell! Which world will you attain now, after making Kausalya endowed with righteousness, deprived of her son?"
"O, cruel woman! Don't you know that Rama the son of Kausalya is a subdued man, who is devoted to his relatives and as an eldest brother, equal to a father?"
"A son is the most beloved to his mother as he is born from the primary and
secondary limbs of her body and also from her heart. The other relatives are only like friends."
"Once upon a time, Kamadhenu the mythical cow of Vasista, who knew righteousness and was worshipped by celestials, is said to have seen her sons, drawing a heavy burden on earth and became unconscious."
"Seeing her sons (a pair of bullocks) fatigued, after toiling for half a part of
their day on earth, Kamadhenu the mythical cow cried with her eyes full of tears in grief for the fate of her sons."
"Small and sweet smelling tear drops of that mythical cow fell on the limbs of the high soled Indra the lord of celestials, who was traveling below in a lower region."
"Seeing those sweet- scented tears falling on his limbs, Indra the Lord of
celestials identified the tears to be those of the great Kamadhenu the mythical cow."
"Looking into the sky, Indra saw that Kamadhenu standing there with anguish and
pitiably weeping with great grief."
"Indra the lord of celestials with a thunder bolt in his hand, seeing that beautiful Kamadhenu the mythical cow, tormented with grief, spoke eagerly with joined palms to her, as follows:
"O, cow the well wisher of all! I hope there is no great panic from any quarter to us. For what occasion is your sorrow?"
"Hearing the words of the intelligent Indra the god of celestials, the prudent
Kamadhenu who was skilled in expressing words, replied as follows:
"Heaven forefend that evil! O, Indra the lord of celestials! There is no danger
whatsoever to you from any quarter. Seeing these pair of bullocks, my sons, who are in hardship, being scorched by sun's rays, becoming weak, being troubled by the man who ploughs the land and being immersed in grief, I am pitiably weeping O, Indra!"
"By seeing them who are afflicted with the burden and aggrieved, I am greatly
anguished. They are indeed born of my body. There is no dearest one equal to a son indeed!"
Seeing such a sacred cow weeping, whose hundreds of sons pervaded the entire world, Indra reckoned none whosoever as more than a son (to a mother) .
"Such a Kamadhenu the sacred cow, which is desirous of maintaining the world always having unequalled behavior, the venerable one, by its very nature functioning forever with good qualities and to whom there are thousands of sons, is lamenting, how much more indeed Kausalya will drag her existence, without Rama?"
"She, who has only one son and who is a holy woman, has been made without a child by you. Thereafter, you will obtain grief forever after your death or even here while living."
"I for my part, shall toil for the complete reinstatement of my brother and complete the obsequial rites due to my father as well as for their prosperity and glory. There is no doubt."
"Rama the son of Kausalya, of great prowess will be brought back to Ayodhya and I, myself will go to the forest inhabited by the sages."
"O, wretched and evil minded woman! By seeing the sorrow stricken citizens, I am
indeed not able to bear the inequity done by you."
"As for you, enter the fire or you yourself go to forest of Dandaka.or fasten a rope around your neck. There is no other recourse for you."
"After Rama the truly mighty man, obtains his native land, I will even become an
accomplished man, with my sins duly washed away."
As an elephant in a forest pricked with a javelin and a goad and as a hissing
serpent, Bharata was enraged and fell on the ground.
His eyes inflamed, his clothes in disarray, and his all ornaments discarded, Bharata the prince and the tormentor of foes, lay on the earth, like a banner of Indra raised at the end of a ceremony.Then, bards and pangegyrists, who knew the importance of tidings, eulogized Bharata with auspicious hymns of praise on the night preceding Naandimukha.
A drum from the sound of which nigh-hours are identified, struck with a golden
stick, gave its sound. Couches and loud-sounding instruments in hundreds producing various types of noises were blown.
That mammoth sound of the musical instruments, as if filling up the whole sky,
created further distress and grief to Bharata who was already tormented with grief.
Then, the awakened Bharata proclaiming that "I am not the king", caused to stop that sound and spoke the following words to shatrughna:
"Behold, O, Shatrughna! How much harm was done to the world by Kaikeyi! The king
Dasartha left us, leaving all sorrows to me."
"This prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya, a foundation of law and religion of that
high-souled Dasaratha the righteous king is now like boat without a rudder moving hitter and thither in water.
"Even that Rama, who was a great protector has been sent to the forest by this verymother of mine, abandoning her righteousness."
Seeing Bharata who lost his consciousness by lamenting in that way, all the women
then miserably cried in one voice.
While Bharata was lamenting thus, the great illustrious Vasishta who knew the rules relating to kings, entered the assembly-hall of Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku dynasty.
The pious minded Vasishta along with his attendants entered that lovely
assembly-hall, made of gold and studded with gems and jewels, resembling Sudharma the celestial assembly-hall.
Vasista, who knew all the scriptures, then sat in a presidential chair made of gold and wrapped with a comfortable cushion. He ordered the messengers as follows:"Quickly bring Brahmanas (a class of people having divine knowledge), Kshatriyas (people belonging to warrior-class), Vaisyas (agriculturists and traders), ministers and troop commanders coolly. There is an urgent duty indeed for us to be done.
"Bring Shatrughna with his royal attendants, the illustrious Bharata, Yudhaajit
(Bharata's maternal uncle) Sumantra the charioteer and those people who are royal well-wishers there."
There was a huge hallooing sound generated while the people invited were coming on chariots, horses and elephants.
People of high position like ministers and other welcomed the approaching Bharata in every way as they had welcomed Dasaratha and as Indra was welcomed by celestials.
That royal assembly, made splendid by Bharata the son of Dasartha, radiated as
before as with the presence of Dasaratha, like a lake of tranquil waters sown with pearls shells and sand and filled with great fish and serpents."King Bhageeratha followed by Ganga has gone to the ocean-like ditch 
			which is dredged up by the sons of Sagara, and entered the subterranean 
			of earth where the sons of Sagara are rendered to ashes." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about the Descent of Ganga. 
While the waters of Ganga are inundating those ashes, oh, Rama, then 
			Brahma, the lord of all worlds, indeed spoke this to the king Bhageeratha. 
			
Oh, tigerly-man Bhageeratha, the sixty thousands sons of great souled 
			Sagara have crossed over the sea of mortality, and on a par with the 
			gods they have also transited to heaven. 
As long as the water of the ocean abides in the world, oh, king, 
			so long the sons of Sagara will abide in heaven like gods. 
This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and hereafter she will 
			remain renowned in the world with the name associated with your deed 
			of bringing her onto earth. 
Henceforth heavenly Ganga will be renowned as 'Triple-path-cruiser' 
			and 'Bhaageerathi,' as well, and as this river is sanctifying three 
			worlds, namely,svarga, bhuu, paataala loka-s, 
			'heaven, earth and netherworld' she will be remembered as the traveller 
			on triple path. 
You may now offer water-oblations to all of your forefathers in the 
			waters of Ganga, oh, king, the lord of people, thus you may fulfil and 
			do away with the pledge of your requiescat. 
Your ancestor Sagara is a highly glorious one and a best one 
			among righteous persons, oh, king, even then he has not achieved this 
			aspiration of alighting Ganga in his lifetime, but you have achieved 
			it. 
Like that, your grandfather Amshuman, who is unequalled in his resplendence 
			in this world and who had been praying for the descent of Ganga, he 
			also could not dispense with this vow on fulfilling it. 
Oh, impeccable Bhageeratha, even by the kingly-sage Dileepa whose 
			resplendence is kindred to great sages, who is equal to me in his ascesis, 
			who is abided by the observances of ruling Kshatriya class, even by 
			such a highly fortunate and highly resplendent father of yours it was 
			impossible to bring Ganga in his turn, even though he had been supplicating 
			for the descent of Ganga throughout his lifetime. 
But, you have accomplished that pledge, oh, the best one among men, 
			and in the world you have achieved highest renown which is highly adorable 
			by all. 
That 'Descent of Ganga' is perfected by you, oh, enemy-represser, 
			and by this you have acquired a genuine basis for righteousness in this 
			world, and thereby a base for yourself in my world, namely Abode of 
			Brahma. 
Oh, phenomenal one, you may always take dip-baths in the holy water 
			of Ganga and oh, persona grata, thereby get purified of sins and thus 
			let your merit be fructified. 
'You may now perform water-oblations to your forefathers with the 
			water of Ganga, let there be wellbeing to you, and oh, king, here I 
			go to my abode and you too may depart to yours.' Thus Brahma said to 
			Bhageeratha. 
On saying in this way, the forefather of all the worlds, and the great 
			glorious lord of all gods, namely Brahma, went away to his empyrean 
			world as he has came. 
On according those best water-oblations that endow superior realms 
			to the souls of sons of Sagara, according to precedency and the rationale 
			of scriptures, and even on offering water-oblations to other manes that 
			kingly-sage and greatly renowned Bhageeratha is sanctified, and then 
			only that king re-entered his own city, indeed when his purpose is completely 
			achieved, and oh, outstanding man Rama, thus that king Bhageeratha ruled 
			his kingdom well. 
On regaining him as their king the subjects of the kingdom are overjoyed, 
			and oh, Raghava, that king Bhageeratha too is relieved of his febrility 
			as his purpose is achieved and he is happy when devoid of haunting grief 
			of getting Ganga to earth. 
Oh, Rama, this way I described to you about 'The Decent of Ganga' in 
			detail, thus you be blest and prosperous, and as the visceral time is 
			elapsing no more questions from you for now, and let us meditate on 
			Gayatri. But listen to the fruits of listening the legend ofganga avataraNa,'The Descent of Ganga' 
This legend is conducive to achieve prosperity, fame, longevity, progeny 
			and even heaven, and he who narrates this legend to others, whether 
			he is from Brahmans or from Kshatriya-s, or for that matter of fact 
			from any other class, his manes will be satisfied, and gods too will 
			be gladdened. 
"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha-s, he who listens to this auspicious legend named 
			'The Descent of Gang,' which is an endower of longevity, all his wishes 
			are achieved, all his sins are obliterated, and his reputation and longevity 
			are also enhanced." Thus Vishvamitra concluded the episode of 'The Descent 
			of Ganga.' When Vishnu attained the sonship of the great-souled king Dasharatha, then Brahma 
			the self-created addressed all of the gods this way. 
"Let mighty and guise changing helpmates be procreated to that truth abiding and 
			valorous Vishnu who is the well-wisher of all of us. 
"Let monkey-shaped progeny equalling Vishnu's valour be procreated from the physiques 
			of prominent apsara-s and gandharva-s, from the girls of yaksha-s and pannaga-s, 
			and also thus from the bodies of kinnaraa-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, she-riksha-s 
			and she-monkeys, and they shall be wizards of miracles and audacious ones, in 
			travel they shall have air's speed, bestowed with intellect they shall be the 
			knowers of ideation, and with their divine physique they shall be ineliminable, 
			they shall be endowed with all the assaultive aspects of all missiles, and they 
			shall be untiring in their efforts, like you who thrive on amrita, the ambrosia, 
			unmindful of thirst and hunger. 
"I have already created the eminent bear Jambavanta in earlier times, as he suddenly 
			came forth from my yawning face. 
When Brahma addressed them thus, those gods have agreed to his order and accordingly 
			started to parent sons in the resemblance of monkeys. 
The great-souled celestial groups, namely the sages, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, 
			caarana-s have created valiant sons that are forest rangers. 
Indra procreated the lord of vanara-s, namely Vali, who by his physique is like 
			Mt. Mahendra, and the highest humidifier among all the humidifiers, namely the 
			Sun, procreated Sugreeva. 
Brihaspati, the Jupiter, gave rise to a great monkey named Tara, who is the most 
			important one among all vanara-s, and who excels all by his intelligence. 
The brilliant Gandhamaadana is the son of Kubera, while the divine architect Vishvakarma 
			procreated the great monkey called Nala. 
The bright son of Fire is Neela whose blaze is like that of fire and who excels 
			other monkeys by his resplendence, renown and courage. 
The Ashwin twin gods whose wealth is their beautiful appearance have personally 
			procreated two vanara-s namely Mainda and Dvivida, blessing them with beautiful 
			appearance.
The Rain-god procreated the vanara named Sushena, and Thunder-god gave rise 
			to the great mighty Sharabha. 
The direct son of Air-god is the marvellous and adventurous Hanuma with an indestructible 
			body, and one identical in the speed of lady Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the 
			divine eagle vehicle of Vishnu, and among all monkey chiefs he is the intelligent 
			and the indefatigable one too. 
Thus the gods have procreated many thousands of such valorous and guise changing 
			monkeys who with their immeasurable strength and bravery are manifest for the 
			elimination of the decahedral demon Ravana. 
And they with their elephantine, mountainous and prodigious bodies quickly took 
			birth in bears, monkeys, sacred langoors. 
Those that are procreated have attained the shape, getup and valour of the god 
			that has fathered them, and thus the monkey race is procreated separately and 
			individually. 
Some of the vanara-s endowed with superior valour are born to female langoors, 
			and like that some more to female bears and kinnaraa-s. 
Several of the gods, great-sages, gandharva-s, eagles, yaksha-s, and the celebrated 
			reptiles, kimpurusha-s, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, uraga-s and caarana-s and even 
			the prominent maidens of apsara-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, naaga, gandharva-s then 
			gladly procreated all of the thousands of forest-ranging and valiant vanara sons 
			from their bodies that are forest rangers. 
They are endowed with guise changing faculties, with bodily might and by their 
			pride and might are identical to lions and tigers, and they are born-free in their 
			movement in forests. 
All of them are the assaulters with stones, and all are the attackers with trees, 
			and all have their nails and claws as their weapons, yet all are experts in missiles. 
			
They can rock greatest mountains, rip firm rooted trees, and with their speed 
			they can agitate the of lord of rivers, namely the ocean. 
They can shatter the ground with their two feet, leap and cross over great oceans, 
			and they can seize the clouds entering arch of heaven. 
They can catch ruttish elephants that tumultuously move in forests, and just with 
			the sound of their blare they make sky flying birds to fall. 
Thus the gods and others have procreated millions of such noble souled Vaanaras 
			as the chiefs of warriors who can change their guise at their wish. 
Those vanara generals who took birth thus became the prominent generals among 
			the principle battalions of monkeys, and they have also procreated brave monkeys 
			on their own. 
Some thousands of them stayed on the ridges of Mt. Rikshavat while others reached 
			many kinds of other mountains and forests. 
All of the monkeys stood by the brothers, namely the son of Indra Vali, and the 
			son of sun Sugreeva, and even with the monkey generals like Nala, Neela and Hanuma 
			et al. 
All of those who are well-versed in warfare and endowed with the might of divine 
			eagle Garuda, used to thwart the pride of lions, tigers and great snakes just 
			by their own prideful subjugation while they move about the forests. 
He who is adroit, extremely mighty, and highly indomitable, that Vali protected 
			bears, langoors, and monkeys just by the strength of his arms. 
The earth with its mountains, forests and oceanward places is overspread with 
			those brave ones that possess diverse physiques and peculiar indication marks 
			of their stock. 
The earth is thus suffused with those mighty army generals of Vanara race whose 
			physiques resembled the clusters of clouds and peaks of mountains, and who have 
			emerged for the reason of helping Rama. Seeing the aforesaid deceased king, who looked like a fully extinguished fire, a
waterless ocean and a lusterless sun, Kausalya holding the king's head on her lap with her eyes full of tears and who was stricken with grief of various sorts, spoke to Kausalya as follows:
"O Kaikeyi the cruel one and the doer of evils! You be there, having fulfilled your desires. Deserting the king, you can enjoy the kingdom undisturbed and without any hindrance.
"Rama has left me and gone to the forest. My husband too has left for heaven. I do not wish to live, as one left behind by a caravan in a wrong road."
"Which woman would wish to survive, leaving her husband who was divine, except
Kaikeyi who kicked off righteousness?"
"A greedy person cannot understand one's faults, like one who eats a forbidden dish. Due to that hump- backed woman, Kaikeyi has ruined the race of Raghu dynasty."
"Hearing Rama along with his wife have been sent to exile by the king as he was
coerced as he was (Kaikeyi) to do an unworthy act, Janaka will profusely lament as I do."
"Rama the pious man who is possessed of like lotus leaves, and who has disappeared from here even though living, now does not know me to have because a support -less widow.
"Even so, Sita, the daughter of king of Videha, the pitiable lady and who is
unworthy of lamentation, will get frightened with grief in the forest.
"Greatly alarmed to hear the fearful cries of wild animals and birds making their
noises in nights, surely she will cling herself to Rama.
"Janaka too who is aged, and who is not having sons, will be thinking of Sita, over whelmed with grief and will surely abandon his life.
"Today itself, I too in devotion to my husband, will meet my appointed end. I shall enter the fire, duly embracing this body of my husband.
The chamberlains reverently removed from that place that unfortunate Kausalya, who was in excess of her grief and was closely embracing her dead husband.
The ministers assigned for the job kept the king in an oil trough and did all the
acts that were to be done therafter.
The ministers who were knowing all such matters were not willing to do cremation for the king in the absence of his sons and that is why preserved the king's body .(in an oil through).
Seeing that the king was laid down in an oil through by the ministers those women in the gynaacium cried "Alas! He is dead!"
Crying their faces with eyes flowing with tears, the miserable women through up
their arms, stricken with grief as they were and pitiably lamented as follows:
"Alas! Great king! When we are already deprived of Rama who speaks lovingly and who always keeps up his promise, why have you left us?"
"Far in distance from Rama, how shall we without our husband, live in proximity to Kaikeyi of wretched nature, who killed her husband?
"Rama, a protector to you and all of us as well as a capable, prudent and an eminent man, has indeed gone on exile to the forest, leaving this lovely kingdom.
"How can we, being disgraced by Kaikeyi, and stupefied by evil passion, live without you and the heroic Rama."
"Whom else will Kaikeyi by whom have been abandoned the king as well as Rama along with Lakshmana great strength and Sita- not abandon?
"With tears and excessive agony, those excellent Dasaratha's wives together in a
row, rolled on the ground, sorrowful as they were."
The city of Ayodhya, bereft of the high-soled king Dasaratha, was splendour-less, as a night without moon and as awoman without husband.
With people disturbed with tears, with virtuous women raising cries of distress and with its cross -roads and entrances of houses looking desolate, the city of Ayodhya did not shine as before.
While the king has gone to heaven due to grief and while the king's wives were lying on the ground , the sun suddenly went away retreating its movement. The night approached, with its darkness having proceeded to spread throughout.
The friends and relatives who came there, did not like the king's cremation in the absence of his sons. Thus thinking, they kept the king of inconceivable sight in that resting place(oil- trough) Deserted by the high-soled Dasaratha, with its roads and cross roads filled with people choked with tears in their throats, the city of Ayodhya, looking like sky without sun and night with its multitude of stars disappeared, did not shine with its light having gone away.
After the king's death, men and women in the city converged in groups, abusing
Bharata's mother, became disturbed and did not obtain happiness.Once upon a time, under which victorious kings, starting from Prajapati-s, this entire earth with all its islands is there, among which kings one 
king named Sagara is there, well-known for his deepening the oceans, 
and whom his sixty thousand sons were fencing in when he is set out for action, in the dynasty 
of such Ikshvaku kings this highly revered and reputed epic Ramayana is originated. 

Being such a legend, we two wish to relate this Ramayana entirely and completely from the 
beginning, which is endowed with the values and means of probity, prosperity, and pleasure 
seeking... and this be listened without any caviling. 
A great kingdom named Kosala, a joyous and a vast one well flourishing with monies and cereals, 
is snugly situated on the riverbanks of Sarayu. 
A world-renowned city is there in that kingdom, which is personally built by Manu, the foremost 
ruler of mankind. 
That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s 
breadth wise. 
That city shines forth with well-laid great royal highways that are always wetted with water, 
and with flowers strewn and scattered on them. 
As an improver of great kingdom Dasharatha the king made her as his abode, as Indra made heavens 
as his abode. 
That city is surrounded with gateways and archways; the front yards of buildings are well 
laid; it is lodges all kinds of machinery, weaponry and craftsmen, and king Dasharatha dwells 
in such a city. 
She that prosperous city Ayodhya is muchly crammed with many a eulogist and panegyrist, yet 
she is highly splendorous with many a bastion, flag and hundreds of batteries of canons, and 
Dasharatha dwells therein. 
That city Ayodhya accommodates groups of danseuses and theatrical personnel, and she is surrounded 
everywhere with the gardens and brakes of mango trees, and her wide fort-wall is like her 
cincture ornament. 
That Ayodhya is an impassable one for trespassers, or for others invaders, owing to her impassable 
and profound moats, and she is abounding with horses, camels, likewise with cows and donkeys. 

With the throngs of provincial kings who come hither to pay dues pervade that city, and she 
is verily lustrous with residents of various other countries, and with traders, too. In such 
a city Dasharatha dwells. 
Buildings are ornamentally studded with precious gems, and with such multi-storied sky scrappers 
she is adorned, and filled with them she is like Amaravati, the capital of Indra. 
Amazing is Ayodhya for its lay-out is like a game board calledaSTapadi, and with 
its flocks of beautiful women moving thereabout, where all kinds of precious gems are heaped 
up, and where its seven storied buildings are picturesque. 
The housing is very dense and there is no place or ground unutilized, and all are constructed 
on well-levelled lands, and rice-grain is plentiful while the drinking water tastes like sugar 
cane juice. 
That city is sounding with the drumbeats of great drums, and with musical rhythm instruments 
like mridanga, cymbals, and with string instruments like Veena etc., and on earth she is uniquely 
the best city. 
Ayodhya is like a hovering space station attained by sages by their ascesis, and its edifices 
are well planned and it is teeming with best people. 
They the skilful archers of that Ayodhya will not kill a lone one with their arrows, one that 
does not have either a predecessor or a successor in his family, a fleeing one, or by listening 
to the sound of the target, as is done in sonic-archery, and their skills, acumen and handiness 
are thus benevolent. 
They kill the fattened and roaring lions, tigers and wild boars with the might of their sharp 
weaponry, or even with the might of their own arms alone. 
With that kind of thousands of archers, and with speediest chariot-warriors she that Ayodhya 
is filled with, and King Dasharatha made his abode in such a city. 
She that Ayodhya is encompassed with Vedic scholars who always worship the ritual fire by 
enkindling the three kinds of ritual-fires continuously, virtuous Brahman scholars in Veda-s 
and their six ancillary subjects, and other great souls that are in similitude with great 
saints, and who are just like sages that are charitable donors, and that abide by the truth. 
Then, on receiving the hospitality in that hermitage for that day, and on the next
  day before sunrise, Rama bade farewell to all of the sages, and thus entered the deep forests.
  
Rama followed by Lakshmana has indeed seen that midst of the forest which is
  filled with very many animal herds, where the bears and tigers are frequenting, and whose trees,
  creepers, bushes are ruined, water ponds rendered unsightly, birds song-less, but where the
  swarms of crickets are whistling deafeningly. 
Therein Rama has seen along with Seetha, a lurid voiced man-eater who is akin to a
  mountain-peak, among horrendous animals. 
Deep eyed, huge mouthed, horrible with a monstrous belly, hideously misshapen, and
  a very soaring one that demon is, an ugly one with a horrendous look. 
Wearing tiger's skin that is wetted with fat and dampened with blood, he is
  frightening to all beings like the wide-open mouth of Death. 
He skewered three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten spotted deer, and a big head
  of an elephant with tusks and fouled with fat on an iron spear, and he is yelling with his
  deafening voice. 
He that demon on seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha ran towards them very angrily,
  like the Time, the Eliminator of people. 
He shouted a tremulous blare, as though to tremor the earth, and seized Vaidehi
  with his arms and gone afar, and then said this way. 
"You two wear jute cloths like hermits, but handle arrows, bows and swords like
  warriors, yet entered Dandaka forest with your wife... your lives are on the wane...
  
"How saintly are you while living with your wife? You sinful fellows dishonest are
  you ways... who are you... you insulters of sainthood? 
"I am a demon named Viradha and I will be on the rove in this impassable forest
  with weapon, always eating the flesh of sages... 
"This best waisted woman will be my wife, and I will drink your blood of you two
  sinful one in a fight with you... 
On listening those arrogant words spoken in bad intent by that evil minded
  Viradha, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, is much panicked. 
Seetha in fear wiggled like a plantain tree in a whirlwind, and on seeing at the
  auspicious lady gone into the arms of Viradha, Raghava spoke this sentence to Lakshmana, with his
  face fully turning to pale. 
"See! Gentle Lakshmana, see that illustrious princes Seetha, the daughter of
  emperor Janaka, one who is brought up comfortably in immense comfort, and my auspiciously
  traditional wife... now gone into the wretched hands of a demon... 
"That which is desired to befall on us, and that which is the choicest desire of
  Kaikeyi, and that which is concomitant to her boons, oh, Lakshmana, that has come to pass
  quickly, and today only Lakshmana... 
"She who is a foresighted lady, she who is not happy with the kingdom for her son,
  she by whom I, a dear one to all beings, am sent to forests, and she is my middle mother, her
  desire is fulfilled today, nay now itself... 
"To me, oh, Soumitri, the grief of others touching Seetha is more, than father's
  demise or grabbing away my kingdom... 
When said thus by Rama, Lakshmana said this with flooding tears of lament, and in
  his anger hissing like a forestalled snake. 
"Oh, Rama, you being the Indra like lord of all beings, and while you are being
  attended by an adherent like me, what for you worry yourself like a derelict? 
"He will now be felled with my arrow as I am enraged at him, and gone are his
  lives now, and indeed the earth shall drink his blood... 
"Indeed, that which anger was there to me on Bharata when he desired kingdom, that
  anger I will now release on Viradha, as Indra released his Thunderbolt on the mountain...
  
"Accelerated by my shoulder strength this ruinous arrow shall fall on his massive
  chest, thus life from his body shall decamp, and then he shall whirlingly fall onto the earth..."
  So said Lakshmana. 
The forest
  Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest.
  One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their
  kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and
  angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom.
Danda took refuge
  in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called
  Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage
  Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda
  reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite
  of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and
  curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta
  capital for a period of seven consecutive days.
Then there is a
  mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called
  Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is
  called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka
  forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as
  the protector of this dominion Jansthaana.
This is the place
  where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where
  Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the
  sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana,
  indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once
  belonged to Rama's kingdom.Then, those able to advise on the nature of soils, those skilled in thread-holding for leveling purposes, those who were energetic courageous and attentive in doing their jobs, excavators, mechanics, labourers, carpenters, road-menders, wood-cutters, hollow-makers, men skilled in plastering and white washing, basket makers, tanners and skilled supervisors of work sallied forth in advance.
That mighty assembly of men gladly setting out to that forest was splendid like an ocean on the day of the full moon having a gigantic commotion.
Men skilled in making roads, furnished with tools of every kin, seeking the company of men of their own proper place, marched ahead.
Clearing away rows of creepers and shrubs timber and big rocks as well as variours kinds of trees (which obstructed the way), they carved out a path.
Some men planted trees in tree-less areas. Some others chopped the existing trees
here and there by means of axes, hatchets and sickles.
Some other strong men removed sturdy tufts of Virana grass and leveled the uneven
places here and there.
Some others filled up wells and extensive pits with earth. Some men leveled
low-lying places all around.
Then, some men bridged the steams that could be bridged, pulverised the rocks thatcould be pulverised and smashed (the impediments that blocked the flow of water) those which could be smashed.
Many ponds, in various sizes and shapes containing plenty of water resembling seas were built (by constructing dams on rivulets).
In water-scarce areas, excellent wells in various shapes were dug duly decorated all around with platforms (to rest).
That track of the troops, having its surface inlaid with cement, with flowering
trees inlaid with cement, with flowering trees on both sides, inhabited with birds in excitement making their sounds, adorned with flags on its either side with its surface sprinkled with water of sandal-wood fragrance, and decorated with various kinds of flowers, looked very much splendid like the path of celestials.
Those officers appointed for execution of the work, as ordered by Bharata,
skillfully instructed their work-men and erected a tent which was intended for the great-souled Bharata, in a beautiful place abundant with tasty fruits. They further adorned profusely with decorations, the tent which itself resembled on ornament.
The connoisseurs erected the tents of the high-souled Bharata at auspicious hours in days when the stars were propitious.
Those camps, with many breast works of sand, moats surrounding each of them, streets as resplendent as sapphires, their crowns of terrets, the ramparts covered with stucco to protect then, the splendid banners, the skillfully laidout avenues, lofty mansions the tops of which wereprovided with dove-cots, which flew about as it were in the air and in splendour, resembled the capitals of Indra.
The route thus prepared, extended upto the Ganga River, whose pure and limpid
waters, abounding in great fish, flowed between woods and forests of every kind.
That beautiful royal high way, which was built gradually by efficient engineers,
appeared as resplendent as a night in a clear sky, illumined by the moon with its procession of stars.On seeing those two very dexterous scions of Kakutstha, and the best ones from Raghu dynasty, namely Rama and Lakshmana, 
grabbed and being carried off, Seetha screamed in a high-pitched voice.
"He that truth-abiding, virtuous, and the flawless Rama of Dasharatha is carried off along with Lakshmana by the demon with 
a ferocious look... 
"Wild bears, tigers and panthers aspire to eat me away... oh, best demon, thieve me instead and release Kakutstha-s... Hail 
to thee..."  
On hearing Vaidehi's that utterance those valorous ones Rama and Lakshmana speedily busied themselves in eliminating that 
evil-minded demon Viradha. 
Soumitri indeed severed the left arm of that ferocious one, while Rama rent the right arm of that demon with his might. 
When his arms are mutilated that demon similar to a dark-cloud is frustrated, fainted, and fell onto ground, like the mountain 
demolished by the Thunderbolt of Indra. 
They battered that demon with their fists, hands and feet, and even by heaving and hurling him again and again they entirely 
pounded on him on the ground. 
Though that demon is battered with many arrows, even sheared off with two swords, and even though he is entirely pounded 
on the ground he is not killed. 
On observing that the mountain-similar demon is ineradicable that easily, then Rama, the sublime one, and the bestower of 
shelter in fear, spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. 
"Oh! Manly-tiger Lakshmana, it is impossible to overpower this demon with weapons in a confrontation, hence, let's bury 
this demon... 
"Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant... 

On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...' then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and 
stood by. 
On hearing that said by Raghava, demon Viradha sincerely spoke these humble words to Rama, the finest one from Kakutstha 
dynasty. 
"Dead I am, oh! Manly-tiger and a coequal of Indra in your strength... I have fallaciously not identified you earlier... 
oh, best one among men... 
"Oh, sire, now I have known you to be Rama, the son of Kausalya... and even propitious Seetha and greatly renowned one Lakshmana 
are now known to me... 
"By curse I had to enter this ghoulish demon's body, but I am a celestial gandharva, named Tumburu and Kubera cursed me... 

"When entreated by me, he that greatly renowned Kubera said to me, 'When Dasharatha's Rama kills you in a fight... then 
you will attain your nature of celestial body and you will go to heavens...' 
" King Kubera thus cursed angrily me for not presenting myself in his service when I was interested in a celestial dancer 
Rambha, and indeed he alone said this curse-clearance to me... 
" And by your grace I am released from this utterly hideous cruse, and now I wish to go to my own heavenly abode, oh, firestorm 
of enemies, let safety betide you all... 
"Oh, Sire, att one and half yojana-s of distance from here Sage Sharabhanga, a great saint of virtue, and an efficacious 
sage with sun-like resplendence dwells, you shall quickly approach him for he advises you opportunely... 
"Rama you go safely on burying me in a pit... this is the age-old custom for those demons that lost vitality... those that 
are inhumed in pit, to them there will be the worlds of manes..." 
"And on saying thus to Rama that Viradha who is hurt by arrows became heaven-worthy on leaving his body. 
And Raghava on hearing those words of the demon ordered Lakshmana, "Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and 
ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant..." On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...' 
then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by. 
Then, on taking a digging tool Lakshmana dug a deep pit beside the great soul Viradha. 
On releasing his throat from the stamping of Rama, he that long eared, lurid voiced Viradha is ensconced in that pit while 
he is still blaring with his horrific voice. 
Those deftly victorious ones Rama and Lakshmana who compose themselves in a given fight, both have gladly raised that Viradha, 
a ghoulish one in fight, a terrifying demon who is still blaring, with all their might and hurled him into the pit. 
On observing the indestructibility of that demon with any weapon, however sharp it might be, those two best ones among men 
that are very expertly skilled have thought over well and undertook the elimination of that great demon in a pit. 
Viradha himself preferred his death at the hands of Rama and desired for a long to be killed by Rama and that forest walker 
himself appraised that, "Killing me with any weapon is impossible..." 
On listening to that which is said by Viradha, Rama resolved his mind to cast him into pit, and when that mighty demon is 
being flung into the pit the whole forest blared with that demon's cries. 
Rama and Lakshmana felt happy by way of their look in burying Viradha in the pit of the earth, and on burying him they two 
felt rejoiced for gone is the fear in that great forest, and within the pit they have also concealed him with boulders in 
order to make it a burial-chamber to the departed soul. 
Then they two who have dazzling golden bows have eliminated that demon and retrieved Seetha, and they gladly journeyed on 
in that great forest like the two entities abiding on the skies, namely the Sun and Moon. 
The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed 
that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill 
Viraadha.aadhyaatma raamaayanawhich occurs in the  chapter  ofbrahmaanmda puraanaalso narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama 
affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. 
A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from 
Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she 
is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess 
Lakshmi. Our concern here is withskaanda purana, a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha's episode 
is explained detailedly. Theskaanda puraanaputs it as:
On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, " She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also 
release from the bondage  On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal 
Her ." etc. Hencevi raadhameant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased 
and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama 
and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones 
the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees.
Again inskaanda puraana, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, thephala shruti it is narrated as:Hanuma, like a bull among the monkeys and the foremost among them, spoke to them as follows: 
"Cherish the honey with a cool mind, O monkeys! I will keep off your opposer who is standing in your 
way."
Hearing the words of Hanuma, the gracious-minded Angada the principal among the monkeys 
repeated the words: "Let the monkeys drink the honey."
"The words, though improper of Hanuma who had accomplished his task, are to be obliged 
certainly by me. Wherefore then, moreover, on such an occasion?"
Hearing the words coming from the mouth of Angada, those monkeys who were like bulls 
among the monkeys were delighted and answered with reverence, saying 'Good, good!'
Reverencing Angada the foremost among the monkeys, all the monkeys rushed towards Madhuvana, 
the grove abounding in honey, like the rush of a river towards a tree.
Because Hanuma had seen Seetha and others had heard of her and because of the grant of 
permission from Angada, all those gifted monkeys entered Madhuvana the grove, overpowered the guards 
with their prowess, drank honey, and partook in juicy fruits there.
Then, all those monkeys jumped on the guards of the grove, who came there in hundreds 
together and banged them.
All those monkeys together took vessels of honey in their arms and drank them. Some others 
banged those who obstructed them.
Some monkeys, with their skin color as yellow as honey, after drinking vessels of honey, 
also threw some honey away. Some others, with the remnant of honey in their arms, after drinking, whipped 
up one another with their excessive intoxication.
Some others, seizing a branch of a tree, stood rooted at the foot of a tree. Some, who 
were highly intoxicated, laid down spreading leaves on the ground.
Those monkeys, who were intoxicated by drinking the honey, became inebriated and started 
pushing one another cheerfully and some others began to stumble.
Some were roaring like lions. Some, with joy, whistled like birds. Some monkeys, inebriated 
as they were by drinking honey, simply slept on the floor.
Doing something or other, some were laughing. Some others were doing something else. 
Some were telling what they were doing, while others were understanding some things else.
The honey-keepers, who were there as messengers of Dadhimukha in that Madhuvana, were 
warded off by the terrific monkeys and they fled to different directions.
Dragged by their knees and tossed up in the air by the monkeys, those honey-keepers were 
very much depressed, went to Dadhimukha and complained as follows:
"The monkeys, as permitted by Hanuma, violently destroyed Madhuvana. We were dragged 
by our knees and further tossed up in the air."
Hearing that Madhuvana was damaged, Dadhimukha, the grove protector there was enraged 
and thereafter consoled those monkeys (as follows):
"Come here let us go there and prevent by our force, the monkeys who are arrogant of 
their strength and are consuming the honey."
Hearing these words of Dadhimukha, the foremost of those monkeys who displayed their 
heroism, quickly went again to Madhuvana along with him.
Grasping a tree, Dadhimukha speedily took up his position in the middle of those monkeys 
in Madhuvana. All his follower monkeys also ran with him.
Those enraged monkeys, taking rocks, trees, and even mountains, went to the place where 
those foremost monkeys were there.
Those heroic monkeys, keeping the words of their master in mind, briskly ran with Sala 
trees, palm trees, and rocks as their weapons.
Then, the valiant guards of the grove running in thousands invaded the monkeys who were 
on trees, at the foot of the trees, and who were arrogant of their strength.
Seeing Dadhimukha coming with anger, Hanuma along with eminent monkeys ran toward him 
with speed.
The enraged Angada struck there with his arms, that long-armed Dadhimukha the maternal 
uncle his father, who was endowed with extraordinary might and who was rushing with speed with a tree 
in his hand.
Blinded with arrogance, Angada did not show any mercy to him on the score of his 
being the maternal uncle of his father and causing him at once to fall and begin to crush him against 
the ground.
That Dadhimukha, the valiant elephant among the monkeys, who was afflicted with his broken 
arms, thighs, and shoulders, drenched as he was in blood, lost consciousness for a moment.
Dadhimukha, Sugreeva's maternal uncle, quickly recovering his breath, was enraged 
and resisted those monkeys, who were highly intoxicated because of drinking honey, with a proper reprimand.
Somehow released by those monkeys Dadhimukha the foremost among the monkeys, went 
to a solitary place and spoke to his messengers who came there (as follows):
"Let these monkeys stay here. We will go to the place where the thick-necked Sugreeva, 
our lord of the monkeys stays together with Rama."
"I will make known to the king, all the misdeeds of Angada. Hearing my words, the enraged 
king will get the monkeys killed."
"This Madhuvana is indeed cherished by our high-souled king, Sugreeva and it derived 
from his father and grandfather. It is so charming, but is dangerous to be approached even by celestials."
"The longevity of these monkeys got reduced, as they were very much lustful of honey. 
That Sugreeva can get these monkeys together with their companions, killed as a matter of punishment."
"These evil-minded beings, who disregarded the royal command, are fit to be capitally 
punished. Our wrath, springing from our impatience, will indeed become fruitful."
Thus speaking to the garden guards, the mighty Dadhimukha quickly springing up all at 
once, went (to Kishkindha) together with the garden guards.
Dadhimukha, the monkey, reached the place where Sugreeva, the intelligent monkey 
was there, within an interval of only a moment.
Seeing Rama, Lakshmana, and Sugreeva, Dadhimukha descended to a level ground, from the 
sky.
That Dadhimukha of great prowess, the supreme lord of the guards, surrounded by all 
those garden guards keeping a sad face, made a respectful salutation to Sugreeva with his head, falling 
down and touching with his head, the auspicious feet of Sugreeva.Just on seeing Dadhimukha, who fell touching his feet with his head, Sugreeva the chief 
of monkeys, with an agitated mind, spoke the following words:
"O valiant monkey! Stand up, rise! Why have you fallen on my feet? I grant you immunity 
from fear. Let the entire truth be spoken!"
Thus inspired by the high-souled Sugreeva with confidence, that highly intelligent Dadhimukha, 
rising, spoke the following words:
"O king! Madhuvana was indeed not set free previously at any time by Riksharajas, your 
father, you, or even Vali. That Madhuvana has been consumed away by the monkeys."
"When these guards of the grove obstructed the monkeys, they disregarded the guards and 
continued to eat the fruits and drink the honey too."
"Some are throwing away a remnant of honey, after drinking it there and some others are 
consuming that remnant. When prevented by us, all of them are indeed exhibiting their eye-brows to us 
(in anger)."
"When these guards of the grove became angry and tried to keep them off from the grove, 
those enraged monkeys threatened them."
"O chief of monkeys! Then, those valiant monkeys in large numbers, having their red eyes 
in anger, drove away these monkeys."
"Those monkeys struck some of the guards with their hands. They beat some of them with 
their knees. They dragged some of them and tossed them into the air."
"While you are in the position of a king, those monkeys have beaten these valiant guards 
and are eating away the entire Maduvana too."
Lakshmana, the killer of hostile heroes and a very wise man, asked Sugreeva, the 
excellent of monkeys (as follows) while Dadhimukha was thus reporting to him:
"O king! Why has this monkey the garden protector, come here?' Pointing out what matter 
has this monkey in grief, spoken these words to you?"
Hearing the words of the high-souled Lakshmana, the eloquent Sugreeva replied to him 
as follows:
"O esteemed Lakshmana! Dadhimukha, the valiant monkey is informing that the foremost 
of monkeys, who returned from the southern direction, after searching for Seetha as also Angada and 
other heroes consumed honey."
"By seeing how these returned monkeys overpowered, destroyed, and behaved 
towards Madhuvana, we can deduce that the monkeys would not have indulged in such an exploit, had they 
not accomplished my purpose."
"When those monkeys have overpowered Madhuvana, then it means that our task has been 
accomplished by the monkeys. Seetha was found. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen 
Seetha."
"There is none other than, Hanuma who is the executor in accomplishing this work. In 
that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, capacity to accomplish any object; intelligence; strenuous, 
vigor effort; and learning are well established in his life."
"Where Jambavan, as well as Angada, are leaders and Hanuma is an administrator, the progress 
of that work cannot be as otherwise."
"It is so reported that Madhuvana has been destroyed by the heroes with Angada as the 
chief and the garden guards who were together preventing the damage, were beaten up with knees."
"To tell this matter in sweet words, the monkey renowned by Dadhimukha by name, with 
his celebrated prowess, has come here."
"O the long-armed Lakshmana! Perceive the truth that Seetha has been seen and see that 
all monkeys, getting together, are drinking honey."
"O Lakshmana, the foremost among men! If the renowned monkeys have not seen Seetha, they 
would not have abused the charming grove; which was granted as a boon."
Then, the righteous Lakshmana, together with Rama, felt delighted. Hearing the words 
coming from the mouth of Sugreeva, which were pleasant for the ears, Rama rejoiced. The mighty Lakshmana 
too was very much rejoiced.
Hearing those words of Dadhimukha, Sugreeva with a charming neck, was very much pleased 
and further spoke to Dadhimukha, the guardian of the grove (as follows):
"I am happy that Madhuvana has been enjoyed by those monkeys, who have accomplished their 
act. Since the act (damage to the grove) done by those monkeys, who have accomplished their purpose 
is fit to be forgiven, I pardon them.
"I, together with Rama and Lakshmana, soon desire to see those monkeys, with Hanuma as 
their chief, who had acquired the pride of a lion and who attained his purpose; and also to hear 
about their effort in finding out Seetha."
Seeing Rama and Lakshmana with their eyes filled with ecstatic delight, the princes, 
who were thrilled with joy and who accomplished their aim, Sugreeva that king of the monkeys was very 
much delighted, knowing that the accomplishment of their work is coming close to their hands and limbs 
were thrilled with joy.King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the sages indent paraphernalia, 
which the ministers are ordered to supply forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 
, excepting the inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in Ayodhya.
After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha desired to perform the Vedic 
ritual. 
Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is like that of a deity, King 
Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny 
to maintaining his family line. 
Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to the king, "So it shall be, let the 
paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative and 
let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, "Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors 
like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well 
as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly..." 
Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic scholars and clergymen. 
Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due worships to all the sages and saints brought in 
by Sumantra, uttered these words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner. 
"My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am thinking of performing the 
Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by 
strict observances... I wish to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage's 
son, Rishyasringa... 
Then "Splendid, splendid is this idea," said the Brahmana scholars blessing the king. Then Sage Vashishta 
along with all other important personalities have applauded the idea that has come out of the king's 
voice, and all those Vedic scholars and clerj~nmen keeping Rishyasringa at helm of affairs said this 
to the king, in appreciation of that idea. 
"Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come to you, you will by all 
means get four sons with boundless valour... let ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse 
be released and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
The Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. 
Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, and he spoke to the other 
ministers of his court, with happiness derived from those good words. 
The king said to his executives, "As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the paraphernalia for my ritual 
be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let 
religious teachers follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the northern 
banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and prospering throughout as ordained 
in the scriptures and tradition... all the kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, 
if only they can perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult ritual... the 
Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the rituals whereat they can inteject themselves 
in to the proceedings of the ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also 
gets ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be conducted faultlessly 
till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the scriptures... since all of you assembled here 
are efficient ones in conducting such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... 

In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying "it will be done accordingly..." 
and indeed they have faultlessly carried out works as ordered. 
Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is like a Sacred Bull among the kings for 
his virtuous endeavour of undertaking the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned 
from there as they have come. 
On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those ministers who are still available 
there for further orders from the king, and then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. 

The Indian yearly time-cycle is two-kind, one on northern solstice and the other southern solstice. 
And seasons are twelve and every two months is a season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing 
on the stars position every year. They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below:The high souled Dasaratha, while lamenting about the unworthy killing of that sage, spoke further to Kausalya as follows:
Having done that great sin inadvertently, having my senses confounded and I being
alone, I thought of using my reason of what best can be done."
"Taking the best water fully in that pitcher, I went to that hermitage by the path as directed by the young sage.
"There I saw the frail, blind and aged parents of the young sage. They were without a guide to support them, as birds whose wings were cut-off. Without any other occupation, they were narrating words only about their son. Having no protector and being immobile they lost the hope of
their son, because of me."
"With my mind afflicted by grief and worried about the impending peril, I fell a
prey to further grief after reaching the hermitage.
"Hearing the sound of my foot-steps, that sage spoke as follows: "O, son! Why are
you late? Give me the water soon."
"My dear son! Your mother is regretting why you are playing in water in this manner.Enter the hermitage quickly."
"O, son! My dear! If any disagreeable thing has been done by your mother, or me,
you, as a sage ought not have kept it in your mind."
"We being helpless, you are our refuge. We being blind, you are our eyes. Our livesare encircled around you. Why are you not talking with us?"
"As though fearful in mind to behold the ascetic, I spoke to him in a tone which was indistinct inarticulate and without some consonants?"
"Having strengthened the firmness in my speech and having abandoned fear in my mind by deliberate efforts, I told him of the alarm that awaited him of his son's death."
"I am Dasaratha, belonging to warrior- class. I am not your high-souled son. This
calamity created by my own act, despised by noble men, befell upon me."
"O, venerable sage! Wearing a bow in hand, I came to the bank of Sarayu River with an intent to kill an elephant arrived to a ford (for drinking water) or any other wild animal."
"Then by me was heard the sound of a pitcher being filled with water. Guessing it as an elephant, I killed it with an arrow."
"Thereafter, reaching the bank of the river there, I saw an ascetic lying dead on
the ground, with the arrow pierced into his heart."
"O, honorable sage! With a desire to kill an elephant by targeting the sound, I
released an iron arrow, and thus your son was killed (hit)"
"Approaching as per his request, closer to him who was suffering from pain, I took out the arrow soon from his vital part."
"Soon after taking out the arrow, he worried about both of you the parents,
lamenting that you were blind and there itself he attained Heaven"
"Unknowingly and unexpectedly your son was killed by me. It has happened like that. Let the honorable sage command me what to do in this matter."
Hearing that cruel news pronounced by me, confessing my sin, that venerable sage
could not resist his severe anger."
"That sage with great splendor, whose face was filled with tears and troubled by
sorrow, spoke with a sigh to me who came near him with joined palms"
"If you have not told me about this shameful deed yourself, O. king, your head would have burst instantly into a hundred thousand pieces."
"A killing brought about by a warrior premeditatedly and in particular to a hermit,would expel even Indra from his post."
"The head of a dispatcher of a weapon with a knowledge of the matter on a sage
established in austerity or such an unmarried student practicing sacred study, gets burst into seven pieces."
"You are still surviving because you have done it unknowingly. Not even you, but
today the whole of Ikshvaaku dynasty would have been no more, if it is not the case."
"He spoke to me thus: "O, king! Now we want to see, as our last look, our son whose body is drenched in blood, with his garment of deer-skin scattered from him, lying unconscious on the ground and who is subjected to the dominion of Yama(god of death) . Take both of us to that place."
"Thereafter, taking both of them, who were weeping profusely, to that place, I for one made that sage and his wife to touch their son."
"Approaching their son, that miserable couple touched their son's body and fell on it . Then, his father spoke as follows."
"My dear boy! You are not offering salutation to me, nor do you talk to me. Why are you sleeping on the floor? Are you angry?"
"O, righteous son! I am beloved to you. Otherwise, see your mother. Why are you not embracing, my son? Utter some words, O delicate youth!"
"Whose sweet and heart touching voice, reciting one sacred text or the other in
particular at the end of the night, shall I hear from now?"
"O, son! Who after taking bath, worshipping the goddess of dawn, and offering
oblations in fire, will be sitting beside me and talking confidently looking at me, as I was afflicted with grief and fear?"
"Who will feed me, like a beloved guest is fed, with roots and fruits while I am
sitting without any work, without fetching anything and without having any guide making me to walk?"
O, delicate youth! How can I support your mother, who is blind, aged and a poor
woman in a pitiable condition, longing for her son?"
"O, son! Come to a halt. Do not go to Yama's abode. You can proceed tomorrow with me and with your mother."
"Bereft of you, afflicted with grief, without any protection in the forest and poor, both of us also will come soon along with you to Yama's abode."
"Thereafter, seeing Yama, I shall tell these words to him.  O, Yama! Excuse me. Let this boy nourish his parents.' "
"The most glorious and high souled Yama, the guardian of the world will be obliged to give this solitary imperishable boon in the form of fearlessness to me, who is in such a condition."
"O, son! This criminal killed you. As it is true that you were sinless, you will
soon obtain the realms as reached by those who die fighting with weapons."
"O, son! Move on to that which is the highest state, which is obtained by the
warriors, who do not return even while being killed, from the direction facing their enemies in battles."
"Obtain the destiny which was obtained by Sagara, Saibya, Dilipa, Janamejeya,
Nahusha and Dundumara."
"O, son! Obtain that destiny, which is obtained by all the sages, by those who
studied scriptures, by an act of austerity, by a gift of the land, by him who has maintained sacred fire, who has taken a vow of marrying a single wife, who gifts a thousand cows, who are owed to the service of the preceptor and that which is obtained by those who have abandoned their body (by journeying to Himalayan Mountains, or drowning themselves in water or leaping into the flames)"
"The one born in the race of sages will not obtain an unsafe destiny. The person,
who killed you, my son, will obtain that bad destiny."
"Thus, that sage repeatedly wept there pitiably. Then he, along with his wife,
started doing the ceremony of offering water to his demised son."
"The pious son of the sage on his part, soon ascended the Heaven, wearing a
wonderful form along with Indra (the king of celestials) as a result of his own pious acts."
"That son of the sage who was together with Indra, talked to his parents. Consoling his parents for a while, he spoke the following words."
"I obtained the supreme state because of my service to both of you. You will also
obtain soon my vicinity."
"The son of the sage, whose senses were subdued, thus spoke and by a wonderful aero plane with beautiful form, quickly reached Heaven."
"That ascetic with great splendor along with his wife soon performed the ceremony
offering water to his dead son and spoke to me, who was standing near him with folded hands."
"O, king! You have made me, without a son, by killing my one and the only one son, by an arrow. You kill me also now. I am not frightened about death."
"Since you have killed my holy son through ignorance, I shall pronounce a most
painful and very cruel curse on you."
"O, king! Even as I am suffering from agony now because of the loss of my son, in
the same manner; you will also die due to agony caused by the loss of your son."
"O, king! Since the sage was killed by you, belonging to the warrior class, through ignorance, the son of killing a Brahmin will not take possession of you."
"A feeling similar to this, which makes the life awful and extinct, will indeed
quickly come to you, even as a merit accrues to the donor of a donation to the priest."
"Pronouncing the curse thus on me, that couple wept many times pitiably, placed
their body on the funeral pile and proceeded to heaven."
"O, Kausalya! The sin I myself committed through ignorance on that day, by invoking an arrow and hitting an invisible object the sound of which was heard, I remember it now on reflection over it."
"O, Kausalya! As a disease comes sometime after eating a nutriment mixed with
forbidden things, this present occurrence came as a result of the sinful act by me long ago."
"O, my dear lady! Those words of that noble sage, saying that I shall give up my
life due to grief for the loss of my son, have come true to me now."
"O, Kausalya! I am not able to see you with my eyes. Touch me well" Thus speaking, King Dasaratha, terribly weeping said to his wife as follows:
"O, queen! The wrong that was done by me in respect of Rama was not befitting of me. But the good that was done by Rama in my case was worthy only of him."
"Which wise man on this earth can abandon his son, even if he is of a bad conduct? Which son, even if he is sent to an exile, cannot become angry with his father?"
"Can Rama now touch me or approach me forth with? Men who attained the world of Yama (god of death) cannot even see their kith and kin."
"O, Kausalya! I am not able to see you with my eyes. My memory- power is fading
away. Messengers of Yama (god of death) are hastening me to come."
"What can be more sorrowful than the fact I am not able to see Rama, who knows
righteousness and who is a truly brave man, at the time of my death?"
"The grief arising out of non-appearance of that son, who performs unparalleled
actions, is parching up my life, as sun- shine dries up a water drop"
"They are not humans but celestials, who will be able to see again in the fifteenth year, the beautiful face of Rama, wearing his handsome ear-rings."
"The fortunate can see the face of Rama, looking like a moon, with its eyes
resembling lotus leaves, with beautiful eye brows, with a comely row of teeth and a charming nose."
"Fortunate are they, who can see the sweat smelling face of Rama, resembling the
autumnal moon and also a full- blown lotus."
"Happy ones can see Rama, who having finished his exile, will come to Ayodhya like the planet Venus coming from a journey."
"O, Kausalya! My heart is sinking down by delusion of mind. I am not able to grasp the related sound, touch and the smell."
"All of my senses are getting scared away due to mental break down, as rays of light of a lamp whose oil is exhausted, starts splattering."
"This grief caused by my own self is collapsing me, who am helpless and insensible, like a river bank being collapsed by the floods of a river stream."
"O, mighty armed! O, Rama! O, annihilator of my grief! Alas! O, darling of your
father! O, my protector! O, my son! Where have you gone?"
"O, Kausalya! O, Sumitra, the miserable! Alas! O, Kaikeyi, the cruel one! My enemy! The disgrace of my family! I am going to die."
In this manner, King Dasaratha weeping as aforesaid, reached the end of his life inthe presence of Kausalya and Sumitra.
King Dasaratha of noble appearance, thus speaking, who was already miserable and
distressed for sending his son to exile, felt afflicted with extreme grief by the time the mid-night passed and forthwith abandoned his life."Rama having departed to the forest, horses on the return path however, shedding
warm tears, did not proceed further on the way."
"I, on my part, offering salutation with joined palms to both the princes and
keeping back from that grief, ascended the chariot and moved on."
"With the hope that I shall be called again by Rama, I stayed there along with Guha for three days."
"Oh, emperor! Even trees in your domain have withered, without giving flowers
sprouts and buds, having emaciated due to Rama's separation."
"Rivers, pools and lakes were with hot water. Groves and gardens were with their
leaves, parched up."
"Living beings are not moving. Wild animals too are not roaming around. That forest became silent, predominated by grief towards Rama."
"Oh, emperor! Lotus-lakes were with lotus-leaves hiding under water pressing
themselves closely together, with muddy waters, with parched lotus-flowers and in which fish and water fowls have completely disappeared."
"Water-born flowers and flowers living on dry lands now give very little fragrance and fruits do not have a luscious look as before."
"Oh, best of men! The gardens here are empty of men and the birds have vanished. I am not seeing the gardens as charming (as before)."
"Nobody greeted me, entering into Ayodhya City. Having not seen Rama, the people are breathing their sigh of lamentation again and again."
"Oh, emperor! Seeing the royal chariot returning here without Rama, all the people along the royal high-way are shedding tears with grief."
"Seeing the returned chariot, women from mansions, seven-storied buildings and royal palaces are crying ha ha!', being troubled by the non-appearance of Rama."
"Women, being more sorrowful, are looking at each other indistinctly with their long bright eyes overwhelmed with a flood of tears."
"I do not see any distinction in their agony, whether they are non-friends, friends or neutral people."
"Oh, emperor! The city of Ayodhya with its joy-less people, with its elephants and horses looking miserable, with sighing exhaustion due to cries of pain, filled with sounds of moaning, cheerless and feeling anguish due to Rama's exile, appears to me, like Queen Kausalya without her son."
Hearing Sumantra's words, the king in a voice choked with tears and very much
woeful, spoke to that charioteer as follows:
"Enjoined by Kaikeyi with her sinful birth and intention, I could not deliberate
with people experienced in counsel or with elders beforehand."
"This act has been done by me in haste due to infatuation for the sake of a woman, without consulting with friends or ministers or with interpreters of sacred texts."
"Oh, Sumantra! This great calamity, surely, has come as an inevitable consequence or for the ruin of this race or accidentally."
Oh, sumantra! If at all I have done any favour to you, lead me fast to Rama. My
vital spirits are hastening me."
"If there is the same unlimited authority of mine even now, let Rama be brought back to Ayodhya. I cannot survive without Rama even for a moment."
"Or perhaps Rama the mighty-armed might have gone a long way. Make me to ascend the chariot and quickly show me to Rama."
"Where is that Rama having pearl-like teeth and wearing a large bow? If only I can see him well with Seetha, I can survive."
"If I cannot see Rama having red eyes, mighty arms and with ear-rings made of gems, I shall proceed to the world of Death."
"What is more distressing to me after getting into this condition, in not seeing
here, Rama who is a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty?"
"Oh, Rama! Oh, Younger Brother of Rama! Oh, unfortunate Seetha! You do not know that I am dying with grief, like one abandoned."
King Dasaratha, his mind very much despaired with grief and plunged in an ocean of sorrow, very difficult to be crossed, spoke (as follows)
"Oh, Queen Kausalya! I am plunged in this ocean of grief. Its area of sorrow is for Rama. its other shore is Seetha's separation. Its waves and huge whirlpools are sighs of anguish.
It is agitated with water and foam as tears. Throwing away of arms is the swarm of fishes. Its great sounds are cries of lamentation. The scattered hari is its duck-week. Kaikeyi is its submarine fire. Which is the cause for the rush in my tears. The words of the hum-backed are its huge crocodiles. Its shores are the boons asked by the cruel Kaikeyi. Its long stretch is due to sending of Rama to far away place. I cannot cross this ocean alive, without Rama. What a pity!"
"Though I want to see Rama and Lakshmana now, I am not able to see them here. It is very bad." - thus lamenting, the king of great renown soon became unconscious and fell down on his couch.
Hearing his words lamenting as much as twice more pitiably for Rama and the king
having fallen unconscious, Kausalya was alarmed once again.As long as the dust raised by the wheels of Rama's chariot could be seen, so long
did the king not withdraw his gaze from it.
As long as the king was seeing his beloved son who was exceedingly virtuous, so long did the dust in the earth appear to be rising for the purpose of seeing his son.
When the dust raised by Rama's chariot was no longer visible, the unfortunate king afflicted by dejection, fell insensible on ground.
When Dasaratha fell down, Kausalya his wife took her place on his right side to lift him up and Kaikeyi of charming limbs took her place on his left side.
The king endowed with wisdom virtue and discretion seeing Kaikeyi beside him, said to her in great agitation as follows:
"Oh, wicked Kaikeyi! Do not touch my limbs. I do not wish to see you .You are no
longer my wife nor a relative."
"I am not of those who are dependent on you nor are they anything to me. I discord you, by whom righteousness has been discorded and who are solely interested in avariciousness."
All that contract which I entered into by taking your hand and circumambulating the sacred fire, I now renounce in this world and the next. "
"If Bharata feels cheerful for having got this kingdom which is imperishable, let
the obsequial rites performed to me after my death do not reach me"
Meanwhile Kausalya the queen overwhelmed with grief, lifted up the king who was
covered with dust and returned to her house.
The virtuous monarch, thinking deeply of his son Rama, was so desolated as one who has slain a brahmin intentionally or as touching the fire by hand.
Turning again and again towards the track of the chariot, the countenance of the
king in grief lost its radiance like sun losing its radiance when swallowed by Rahu.
Afflicted by grief, thinking of his beloved son he lamented. Knowing that his son
reached the end of the city, he said as follows:
"The marks of hooves of excellent horses which carried away my child are seen on the way. But he the great souled one is not being seen"
"He who slept on comfort on coverings sprinkled with the essence of sandalwood and refreshed by fans waved over by him by the most deserving women, Rama the best of all my sons , will from now on , has to take refuge at the foot of a tree somewhere, lying down on its trunk or rest on a stone."
"The unfortunate one will wake up from the hard earth stained with dust, sighing
like a bull-elephant rising from the side of a hill"
From today the inhabitants of the forest will behold that long armed lord of the
world, Rama, rising from the ground and wandering around like an orphan"
"The daughter of Janaka, who was always accustomed to comforts, will wander
exhausted in the forest through the thorny undergrowth "
"Sita who was not earlier accustomed to woodlands, from now on will live in terror, hearing the roaring sound of wild beasts ,which was thundering ."
"Oh, Kaikeyi! Let your desire be fulfilled! Dwell in the kingdom as a widow. I do
not indeed wish to survive without Rama the tiger among men."
Thus lamenting, the king surrounded by his people, entered Ayodhya the best of
cities like entering a disastrous house by one who has taken the funeral bath.
Seeing the entire city with its road-junctions and mansions deserted, its shops and temples closed, with its people exhausted with fatigue and plunged in affliction; its highways not very crowded ,the king entered his palace wailing and thinking of Rama alone as the sun enters a cloud.
Bereft of Rama Sita and Lakshmana, the palace looked like a big pool rendered
unperturbed due to emptying of snakes in it by Garuda*
The lamenting monarch spoke in trembling accents and in soft, pitiful, indistinct
and not clearly intelligible words (as follows):
"Take me quickly to the apartment of Kausalya the mother of Rama. Nowhere else my
heart will find solace "
The attendants took the king who was speaking as aforesaid, to Kausalya's house and there he was gently laid (on a coach).
Having entered Kausalya's apartment and even though laid on a coach, his heart
became agitated.
Bereft of his two sons and his daughter -in-law also having deserted, the king saw that house devoid of charm as a sky without a moon.
Looking at that palace and lifting up his arm, the powerful monarch cried in a loud voice, " Oh, Rama! You have left us both, your mother and I."
"Alas! Those jewels among men who will survive the term of fourteen years, seeing
Rama come back and embrace him, will be happy indeed."
Thereupon, the night having fallen, the night resembling the hour of death to him, Dasaratha spoke these words to Kausalya when the midnight struck :
"Oh, Kausalya! My sight has extinguished along with Rama and not returned. Even now, I am not able to see you properly. Touch me with your hand."
Perceiving that monarch on the coach absorbed in the thought of Rama alone, Kausalyaappeared very sad and sitting beside him, began to sigh and lament with a distressed look.On seeing Seetha wearing bark of trees like a helpless woman, eventhough protected by her husband all the people there loudly cried out: "Fie upon you, Dasaratha!"
Pained by that loud cry there, King Dasaratha lost interest in his life, religious merit and esteem.
Dasaratha with a warm sigh, spoke to his wife these words. "Oh, Kaikeyi! Seetha does not deserve to go with a robe made of Kusa grass."
"My preceptro truly says that Seetha, who is delicate young and ever habituated to comforts, is not fit for forest-life"
"has this pitiable daughter of Janaka, the jewel of kings, done any harm to any one that, having obtained a bark of tree she is standing like a hermitess dumbfounded in the midst of men?"
"Seetha the daughter of Janaka need not wear these barks of trees. No such pledge
was given be me earlier. hence, let this prinecess go to the forest happily fully provided ewith all valuable possesssions."
"A Cruel pledge has been made on oath by me, who do not deserve to survive. This
(providing robes of hermitess to Seetha) has been initiated by you by sheer childishness. That will consume me, as by its own flower to a bamboo."
"Oh evil woman! (Even) supposing a little offence is done by Rama to you, what harm was displayed to you here by Seetha? Oh, mean woman!"
"What harm on earth can be done to you by Seetha, who has blooming eyes like those of a female deer, soft in disposition a practiser of penance?"
"Oh, the evil woman! Sending Rama to exile thus indeed is enough for you. What use is there for you in further doing these wretched, sinful acts too.
"Hearing the speech you gave to Rama who came here for coronation, only that much
was acceded by me, Oh queen!"
"Transgressing all that, you somehow or other wish to go to hell, by perceiving
Seetha also clad in bark of trees.
That high-souled king thus lamenting, did not see any ending to that sorrow.
Drenched as he was in excessive devotion to his son and having been hurt vey much, he fell down on the ground.
Rama, who was setting out to the forest, spoke these words to his father, who was
speaking thus bowing down his head, sitting there.
"Oh, virtuous king! This glorious Kausalya, my mother is aged. She is not of base
nature and will not accuse you.
"Oh, the bestower of boons! You are worthy of amply respection her, who is deprived of me, who is immersed in an ocean of sorrow and who has not see such an affliction earlier."
"Having been honoured by you the venerable man, she the pitiable woman will not get such a grief for her son, thinking of me alone and she will draw breath in you."
"Oh, the king akim to the mighty Indra the ruler of gods! You must see that my
mother, who has high affection towards her son, will not depart to the house of Yama the God of Death, by abandoning her life being emaciated by grief after my departure for the forest."The king, awakened after some time, with his mind afflicted with grief, got into an anxious thinking.
Due to banishing of Rama and Lakshmana, a great calamity befell on Dasaratha who was equal in strength to Indra like sun seized by obscurity, which is attributed to the demon Rahu.
After Rama along with his wife departed to the forest, Dasaratha the king of Kosala recalling his earlier sin, wanted to tell Kausalya, whose eye-corners were dark in colour all about it.
After Rama was sent into exile to the forest, King Dasaratha, on the sixth night at mid-night, was recalling his sin done (long ago).
King Dasaratha, afflicted by grief for his son, recalling his sin, spoke the
following words to Kausalya who was suffering from sorrow for her son.
"O, blessed lady! O gracious one! A doer reaps surely the fruit of his own deeds
corresponding to the nature of work either good or bad, of that which he does!"
"He who does not consider, while undertaking actions, the relative value of their
fruits as well as the utilities or defects accruing from them, is surely called a fool."
"Anyone, who after seeing their (charming and big) flowers, greedily desires their (large and luscious) fruits and nourishes Palasa trees, by cutting off a mongo grove, he will come to grief after bearing of their fruit."
"He who without knowing the result goes running towards action, will come to grief as a nourisher of Kimsuka trees coming to grief at the time of their fruit-bearing."
"I nourished Palasa trees, by cutting off mango grove. Being wicked-minded in
abandoning Rama at the time of arrival of fruit, I am lamenting thereafter."
"This sin was done by me while I was young and wielding a bow. At that time, I was famous as a young man, who can shoot heard (but unseen) object by an arrow, O Kausalya!"
"This grief, obtained by my own accord, has befallen me, as by a boy in ignorance
eating poison in the world; O, Kausalya!"
"How the other man became disillusioned by Palasa trees, I also became disillusioned in the same manner, without knowing accurately the correct result of hitting a target by means of sound only."
"O, Kausalya! You were unmarried till then and I was the Prince Regent. Then came
the rainy season which enhanced excitement and desire (for hunting)."
"The sun, partaking fluids from earth and warming the world with its rays, entered the terrible southern quarter haunted by spirits."
"Heat disappeared suddenly. Resplendent clouds appeared in the sky. All frogs,
cuckoos and peacocks were full of joy."
"Birds with moistened top of their wings as if they bathed, reached with great
difficulty the trees, the tops of which were shaken off by rain and wind."
"Enveloped by water falling again and again on the water already fallen, the
mountain with its antelopes in rut, glowed like an ocean."
"Although the water-streams were crystal clear, they flowed in serpentine courses, with white and red colours because of their admixture with ashes and mountain-minerals on the way."
"The water-streams, which were crystal-clear till then, became churned with reddish waters, carrying water by a wrong way, after the onset of rain."
"With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went
along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows."
"Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place."
"Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the
bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there."
"Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant."
"With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a
serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it."
"I released a sharp arrow, resembling a serpent. There, at dawn, arose a distinct
voice uttering 'Ah! Ah!' of a forest-inhabitant, dropping down in water after his vital part was hit by an arrow."
"While that arrow was attacking a human voice there was heard, saying, 'Oh, how a
weapon did rush upon an ascetic like me?' "
'I came to the river, which is away from habitation, in the night to fetch water. By whom I was hit by an arrow? On the other hand what wrong have I done to anyone?"
"To a seer like me, of having laid down violence and living a fruits and roots of
wild plants in the forest, how a killing by an arrow is enjoined?"
"Who is desirous of killing me, wearing a mass of locks of hair and clad with bark of trees and deer-skin? What harm was done to him by me?"
"A vain act concerning only with a useless objective is undertaken in this manner. No one will admire him, as for instance like any man seeking the bed of his preceptor's wife, as good."
"I do not worry that much of my death. I worry both for my mother and father, in the case of my death."
'By what means of livelihood this elderly couple, maintained since a long time by
me, support themselves when I obtain my death?'
"I and my aged parents are killed by a single arrow. By a man without self control and being very much a fool, all of as are virtually killed."
"Hearing those pitiable words and since I was always intent on righteousness, I felt distressed. The bow and arrow fell down from my hands to the ground."
"Hearing his pathetic cry, weeping profusely during the night, I became unconscious frequently, utterly bewildered as I was, due to flare-up of my grief."
"Distressed in mind and with much sorrowful feeling, I reached that place and saw
the ascetic, hit by the arrow at the bank of Sarayu River, with his tresses of hair scattered, his pitcher of water thrown asunder, having his limbs anointed with sand and blood lying down as he was, hurt by the arrow."
Looking up with his eyes, as if going to scorch with his glory, at me who stood
terrified and sick in mind, he spoke those harsh words then:
"O, king! I, who was carrying water for my parents, was hit by you. What was the
harm done to you by me who is residing in a forest?"
'Being hit on my secret part by a single arrow, you virtually killed both my mother and father, who are blind and aged.'
"Both of them, weak blind and thirsty, might have refrained their thirst with
difficulty and waited with expectation of my arrival since long. I am sure."
'Surely, our (mine or father's) religious austerity or sacred knowledge have not
borne fruit because my father does not have information about me, having fallen down and lying on the ground.'
"What my disabled father, unable to walk around can do, even if he knows like a tree unable to protect another tree which is being cut off?"
'O, Dasaratha! Going there soon, you alone tell my father; so that he will not
scorch you by his anger, as a forest is scorched by a flared-up fire.'
'O, king! This foot-path will lead you to my father's hermitage. After going there, seek his graciousness, lest he should get angry and execrate you."
'O, king! Extract this arrow-head from my body. This sharp arrow torments my
delicate vital part in the same way as a river-current corrodes the sandy bank, which is at a height.'
"While extracting the arrow-head from him, this thought entered my mind. With
arrow-head in his body he will suffer, even though surviving. But after extracting the arrow-head, he will die."
"Then, the son of the sage perceived worry in the heart of myself, who was lamenting pitiably, suffering from anguish."
Sinking into despondency with distress, distorting his limbs in agony, coiling round himself on the floor with extreme pain and having approached the end of his life, he spoke to me (as follows) with great difficulty.
'Suppressing my grief with firmness, I am becoming stable-minded. Let the torment in your heart, caused by the thought of your having killed Brahmana be removed.'
'O, king the ruler of the country! I am not a Brahmana. Let there be no agony in
your mind. I am born through a Sudra woman by a Vysya.
"While he was speaking in that manner with great difficulty, his vital part having been hit by an arrow and was rolling on the ground, now exerting himself, now trembling and sinking, I drew out that arrow from him. That sage looked up towards me in fear and relinquished his life."
"O, my dear Kausalya! Seeing him, with his body drenched in water, weeping with
anguish, unceasingly sighing his breath, with injury in his vital part and lying down in River Sarayu as he was, I became very much grief-stricken."While the night passed away, there arrived at the residence of the emperor, at the dawn of the next day, highly cultured and excellently learned bards who were pronouncers of benedictions and whose custom was to eulogize the king, as well as singers and panegyrists uttering recitations in different styles.
Their sounds of praises, uttering benedictions in a loud voice and pronouncing
accolades of the king, pervaded in full the interior area of the palace.
While those bards are uttering praises, others who make a bang of claps, patted the claps, eulogizing the previous glorious acts of Dasaratha.
The birds dwelling in royal palaces perched on the branches of trees and others in cages were awakened by that sound and began to twitter.
The auspicious words uttered by bards parrots etc and the notes of Vina as well as blissful songs of the metric verses filled that palace.
Then, as before, persons who maintain pure practices and those who were skilled in the services to the king, most of whom were women and eunuchs, arrived there to serve the king.
Those who took care of royal ablutions brought water sprinkled with yellow sandal in golden pitchers in accordance with appropriate time and the set procedures.
In that manner, women too most of whom were virgins brought all that were pleasing to the touch, eatables, decorative clothing and ornaments.
All that was brought near him was endowed with all auspicious characteristics
offered with reverence as per prescribed scriptures. All that was extremely graceful. All that retinue, greatly excited as they were, without coming near to the king and with a suspicion as to what was it, stayed thus till sunrise.
The women who were empowered to go near the bed of Dasaratha went in proximity to
him and woke him up.
Even so, those modest and prudent women with proper conduct, touched Dasaratha's bed and could not detect any sign of life whatsoever in him.
Those women knew the condition of a body in sleep, by its gestures, movements and
others. As such, they were possessed of tremor apprehensive as they were about the king's life and they resembled like tips of reeds standing against a stream.
Now, seeing the king, certainty arose in the minds of those doubting women about the calamity (of death) that was apprehended.
Overpowered by grief for their sons, the slumbering Kausalya and Sumitra did not
wake up, as though they were completely overtaken by death.
Kausalya bereft of luster, pale faced, emaciated with grief and dispirited, did not shine brightly (as before) like a star hidden away in darkness.
The queen Kausalya, immediately close to the king and with Sumitra on her side, was not shining as before with her face ruffled by tears of grief.
The persons in the gynaecium, having seen those distinguished queens in slumber and also the king in that manner, thought that the king had lost his life while just sleeping.
Then, those beautiful women miserably cried loudly with their voice, like female
elephants crying when their group leader an elephant was removed from their place in the forest.
Kausalya and Sumitra suddenly obtained consciousness by the sound of their cries and woke up from sleep.
Kausalya and Sumitra, on seeing and touching king Dasaratha, cried  O, Lord!' and
fell on the ground.
Rolling on the floor and covered by dust, Kausalya the daughter of Kosala king was not shining as before and resembled a star falling down from the sky.
While the king was deceased, all the women saw Kausalya who fell on the floor
appearing as a female elephant, which was killed and felled on the ground.
Kaikeyi and all other wives of king Dasaratha were weeping afflicted by grief and
fell unconscious.
That great noise was supplemented by those wailing women, bloated by which, it
rendered the house all the more noisy.
That gynaecium of the king who met his appointed end was filled with people who felt bewildered with fear and restlessness, with tumultuous wail all around, and crowded with relatives disturbed by sorrow, with happiness withered away in it suddenly and became a sight of misery and despondency.
Knowing that the glorious king of excellence had passed away, the king's wives
surrounded him with great sorrow; pitiably wailing profusely and lamented, grasping their hands one another, like orphans.King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the sages indent paraphernalia, 
which the ministers are ordered to supply forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 
, excepting the inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in Ayodhya.
After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha desired to perform the Vedic 
ritual. 
Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is like that of a deity, King 
Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny 
to maintaining his family line. 
Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to the king, "So it shall be, let the 
paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative and 
let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, "Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors 
like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well 
as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly..." 
Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic scholars and clergymen. 
Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due worships to all the sages and saints brought in 
by Sumantra, uttered these words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner. 
"My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am thinking of performing the 
Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by 
strict observances... I wish to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage's 
son, Rishyasringa... 
Then "Splendid, splendid is this idea," said the Brahmana scholars blessing the king. Then Sage Vashishta 
along with all other important personalities have applauded the idea that has come out of the king's 
voice, and all those Vedic scholars and clerj~nmen keeping Rishyasringa at helm of affairs said this 
to the king, in appreciation of that idea. 
"Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come to you, you will by all 
means get four sons with boundless valour... let ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse 
be released and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
The Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. 
Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, and he spoke to the other 
ministers of his court, with happiness derived from those good words. 
The king said to his executives, "As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the paraphernalia for my ritual 
be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let 
religious teachers follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the northern 
banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and prospering throughout as ordained 
in the scriptures and tradition... all the kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, 
if only they can perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult ritual... the 
Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the rituals whereat they can inteject themselves 
in to the proceedings of the ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also 
gets ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be conducted faultlessly 
till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the scriptures... since all of you assembled here 
are efficient ones in conducting such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... 

In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying "it will be done accordingly..." 
and indeed they have faultlessly carried out works as ordered. 
Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is like a Sacred Bull among the kings for 
his virtuous endeavour of undertaking the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned 
from there as they have come. 
On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those ministers who are still available 
there for further orders from the king, and then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. 

The Indian yearly time-cycle is two-kind, one on northern solstice and the other southern solstice. 
And seasons are twelve and every two months is a season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing 
on the stars position every year. They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below:Introduction
Dasaratha mentions his desire about coronation of Rama before the assembly of people. All people in the assembly unanimously and delightfully accept it while describing all of Rama's virtues.
Addressing invited gathering in the court, Dasaratha spoke in friendly, pleasing and clear terms.
In a loud voice resembling that of a kettle-drum, resounding the air like a
thundering cloud and in a sweet splendid and incomparable voice endowed with the characteristics of a king's voice, King Dasaratha the lord of men spoke to the kings as follows:
"It is well known that my excellent kingdom was ruled by my ancestral kings as if it were their son."
"I have a desire that this entire land which was protected by the descendents of
Ikshvaaku dynasty, be bestowed with goodness and the resultant happiness."
"Following the path established by my ancestors, I have always protected my people with alertness and to the best of my ability."
"In conducting the kingdom for benefit of the entire people, my body became impaired under shade of the white umbrella."
"This body has been living for many thousands of years. Hence I desire rest."
"This burden of worldly righteousness is very heavy. This can be sustained only by royal power with qualities like courage and valor. A person who has no control of senses can not carry this burden. I have become tired while carrying this burden of righteousness. "
"I desire to take rest, entrusting the rule to my son for the benefit of the people, after obtaining consent from all those best Brahmans who are close to me."
"My eldest son Rama is equal to Devendra in valor. He is the conqueror of cities of enemies. He is equal to me in all qualities."
"Joyfully, I shall appoint Rama, who shines like the moon together with Pushya star, who is the best among the protectors of righteousness and who is an excellent man, to the realm of prince."
"If Rama becomes the lord, the three worlds also will have the best master. He is a glorious man. That Rama is the only fittest lord for the kingdom."
"By entrusting this kingdom to Rama, I shall be thus doing an immediate good and
shall be devoid of difficulties."
"I am telling this after lot of thinking. Give consent to me if you feel this to be good and befitting. How else shall I do it?"
"This is my desire. Yet, let there be thinking on any other beneficial way. Thinking by impartial neutral people will be distinctive and well developed through grinding of opposing views."
Those delighted kings complimented king Dasaratha so speaking with a loud applause as the peacocks cry in delight when they see the raining great cloud.
That building appeared trembling by the sweet and reverberating sound made by the
gathering of people there with their fond uproar.
After understanding the opinion of King Dasaratha, who knew the holy and worldly
matters, the Brahmans, important people, urban and rural citizens came to a consensus after discussing together and told the aged king as follows.
"Oh king! You are an elderly person with thousands of years of age. Hence,
inaugurate Rama as the ruling prince."
"All of us want to see Rama, with long arms, the hero with great might born in the clan of Raghu , his face protected by a white umbrella, moving on a great elephant."
King Dasaratha, after hearing their words, spoke as follows as though he did not
know their mind earlier and sought to know their true intention.
"Oh kings, I have a doubt as to why you want Raghava to be the king immediately
after hearing my words. Inform your real opinion in this matter."
"Why do you desire to see my son as the prince, when I am ruling this earth with
righteousness?"
Those kings together with urban and rural citizens after hearing those words spoke to the great soul Dasaratha as follows: "Oh king! Your son Rama has many auspicious virtues".
"Oh king! We shall tell you now the various virtues of your wise son, listen to
them. His qualities are equal to those of celestials. They are liked by all. They give happiness to all."
"Oh king! Rama is equal to Devendra in heavenly qualities. He has true valor. He is greater than all the kings born in Ikshvaaku clan."
"Rama is the world renowned gentleman. He is keenly interested in truth and
righteousness. Only Rama can make both righteousness and wealth combine without separation."
"He is equal to moon in making the people happy; equal to the earth in the quality of forgiveness; equal to Brihaspati in wisdom and verily to Devendra in valour."
"Rama knows all righteousness. He is true to his word and has good character. He has no envy. He has patience. He consoles those who are in troubles. He speaks good words. He has gratitude. He keeps senses under control."
"Rama is soft natured; has stable mind, always an auspicious man, and has no envy.
He speaks truthful and loving words to all living beings. He worships aged Brahmans endued with the knowledge of various sciences. By that, his name, glory and splendor are growing in this world."
"He is skilled in the use of various weapons known to celestials, demons and men. He has duly concluded his vow of studying the various sciences and has systematically learnt all the Vedas along with its branches. *"
"Rama is best in the world in the art of music. He has best relatives. He is gentle. He is not weak in mind. He has great wisdom."
"Rama was trained in all matters from the best of Brahmans skilled in the art of
righteousness and in the science of political economy. If it is necessary to go to a battle to protect a village or a city, Rama goes with Lakshmana and returns home only after obtaining victory."
"After returning from battle, Rama goes to citizens on an elephant or a chariot and inquires about their well being as though they were his own kinsmen, like a father does to his sons. He asks about their wives and children, about the sacred fires, about their servants and students, always completely as per the due order."
"Rama the best among men always asks us interrogatively thus: 'Are your disciples serving you by keenly performing their actions?' "
"Rama feels very sad towards afflictions of men; and feels delighted in all
functions celebrated by people on the occasions of child birth and the like, just as their own father does."
"Rama speaks only truth. He is a great hero. He serves elders. He kept the senses
under control. Rama, who talks smilingly, protects righteousness in all ways."
"Rama duly procures beneficent deeds. He is not interested in wrangling talks. He is an orator like Brihaspati by his replies and rejoinders."
"Rama, who enchants the world, has beautiful eyebrows. He has red and broad eyes. He is absolutely like the God Vishnu himself in strength, heroism and valour."
"He knew the ins and outs of public administration. His senses are not afflicted by passion. He is capable of administering not only earth, but also the three worlds."
"Rama's anger or mercy is not arbitrary at any time. He kills those who are to be
slain as per rules. He is not angered at the innocent."
"He gladly bestows wealth to those with whom he is satisfied. As the sun shines by his rays, Rama shines by his qualities that are peaceful, which are enchanting and delightful to men."
"All people desire Rama, who is endowed with this wealth of qualities, who has true valour, who is equal to presiding deities like Devendra, to be their lord."
"Oh king Dasaratha! Rama is born to you as a son, because of your good fortune, for the welfare of this world. He has all the virtues befitting of a son, like Kasyapa, the son of Marichi."
"All people in the state including those in the capital as well as those in the
nearby and in the far off places, pray for long life, health and strength of Rama of reputed nature."
"Both young and aged women are praying with a stable mind each morning and evening to all celestials, for the benefit of renowned Rama."
"Oh best of kings, Dasaratha ! We shall see Rama adorned with princely kingdom. Your son Rama has the complexion of a black lotus flower and annihilates all his enemies. Let the wish of the people be fulfilled by your grace."
"Oh fulfiller of people's desires, Dasaratha! For our benefit, you gladly and
immediately inaugurate your son Rama, who is equal to Vishnu, who is interested in the welfare of the entire world and who is possessing the best of virtues."Dasaratha was not suitable for such an unfortunate condition nor was he habituated to such a situation. He was lying down on the floor, as king Yayati who fell down on earth fter exhausting his merit in the region of heaven. Kaikeyi who was a manifestation of worthlessness who accomplished her desire, who was fearlessly exhibiting her fearful form, asked for those boons again in a loud voice, to Dasaratha who was in such a bad mood situation.
"Oh, king! You always boast yourself, saying "I speak truth. I am persisted in my
promise." Now, why are you objecting to my boon?"
After thus spoken to by Kaikeyi, Dasaratha became angry, turned out delirious for a moment and again spoke as follows:
"Oh, the vulgar one! You, my enemy! You want to be happy after your desire is
fulfilled when Rama the best among men leaves for the forest and when I die thereafter. Alas!"
"When celestials ask for me about Rama's well-being after I reach heaven, how can I indeed convince them that he is well obscuringly the actual fact?"
"If I tell without obscuring the fact that I sent Rama to exile desirous of showing kindness to Kaikeyi, nobody will believe me."
"With much effort I, the childless begot the great and powerful Rama as my son. How can I abandon such Rama?"
"How can I send away Rama who is valiant and knowledgeable, who has subdued anger, who has forbearance and who has eyes like lotus-petals".
"How I can I send Rama, who is dark blue in colour like a blue lotus, who is
long-armed , who is very strong and graceful, to Dandaka forest?"
"Rama is accustomed to comforts. He is not accustomed to difficulties. How can I
imagine such sensible Rama in a troublesome situation?"
"Oh, cruel one! One with sinful thoughts! Oh, kaikeyi! why are you planning to do
harm to Rama who is beloved to me and who is truly heroic? I shall certainly get unequalled ill fame and humiliation in this world".
While Dasaratha was thus lamenting with his disturbed mind, there was approach of
night with setting of the sun.
To Dasaratha, who was thus lamenting painfully, the night seemed to be dark even
though it was adorned with charming circular moon.
The aged Dasaratha was lamenting painfully as though afflicted with a disease, with lot and hard breaths, having his eyes fixed on the sky.
"Oh, auspicious night, decorated with stars! do not wish you to do break into a
dawn. Have mercy on me. I pray with folded hands."
"Otherwise, Oh, Night! Leave away quickly. I do not went to see Kaikeyi, who is
shameless, cruel and for whose reason this great calamity occurred"
The king spoke like this and beseeched kaikeyi with folded hands. He again spoke
this word to Kaikeyi.
"Oh, auspicious queen! I am a well conducted man. I am dejected and seeking refuse in you. I am an old man and especially a king. Be kind to me."
"Oh, well-hipped one! I hope that whatever I told, has not merged in the sky. Oh!
young woman, be kind to me . You are good-hearted."
"Oh, queen with dark outer corner of eyes be kind. You your self give my kingdom to Rama. Thus, you will obtain great fame."
"Oh, broad hipped, with beautiful face and eyes! do this. It will be pleasing to me, to Rama, to the world, to priests and to Bharata."
Hearing the king, who was her pure-hearted husband and who was pitifully lamenting strangely with red eyes filled with tears, that bad tempered cruel woman did not follow his words.
Seeing his discontented wife talking unpleasantly about sending Rama to forest, that king was distressed, fainted again and fell down unconscious on the floor.
While the distressed and self-respected king was sighing terribly in the way, that night came to an end. In the dawn, bards and singers started to awaken him. But the excellent king prevented them to do.After the citizens left, Dasaratha who was efficient in taking decisions pertaining to place and time of ceremonies, again conferred with the ministers and decided thus: "Tomorrow will be a day when the constellation of Pushya would be in the ascendant. My son Rama, who has eyes like red lotus, can be crowned as a prince tomorrow".
Thereafter, king Dasaratha entered the inner palace and then ordered Sumantra thus, "Bring Rama again here".
Obeying the king's words, Sumantra went to Rama's house immediately to bring Rama
once again.
The doorkeepers informed Rama that Sumantra had come again. Hearing that, Rama was uncertain as to the reason for Sumantra's arrival again.
Rama immediately allowed Sumantra inside and spoke these words to him: "Tell me
completely the purpose of your arrival again."
Hearing those words, Sumantra said: "King Dasaratha wants to see you. Decide
yourself in this matter whether to proceed to your father or otherwise".
Rama, after hearing Sumantra's words, started immediately and went to the royal
palace to see king Dasaratha, the Lord of people, again.
Hearing Rama to have arrived, king Dasaratha allowed him to come into the house, to tell him an excellent and affectionate word.
The glorious Rama, soon after entering his father's house, saw his father from a
distance and fell prostrate before him in an act of submission, with his palms joined together.
Dasaratha lifted Rama up and took him into his embrace. Then, he offered a beautiful seat to Rama and spoke to him as follows:
"Oh Rama, I have now become aged after living for a long period. I enjoyed all the luxuries in life, as I desired. I propitiated Gods by performing hundreds of sacrifices, in which food and lots of fees were given away to the officiating priests. "
"O Rama, the best of men! You are now born to me as without an equal on earth and as my beloved child. I had given away lots of donations, I had performed holy rites and I have also studied Vedas and other Holy Scriptures during my life time."
"Oh gallant Rama! I also enjoyed all the comforts, as I desired. Thus I am relieved of all debts to the celestials (by performing holy sacrifices), to the sages (by studying Vedas etc.), to my ancestors (by begetting you), to the Brahmans (by giving away donations and food) and to myself (by enjoying all comforts as I desired)."
"I have no duty other than to anoint you for the crown. Hence, do what I tell
you."
"Now all the people want you to be the king. Hence, I can install you as
prince."
"Oh, Rama! It is not only the people's desire, but also these days I am getting
fearful and inauspicious dreams. Here, thunderous comets are falling with great sound, during day time."
"Oh, Rama! Astrologers are informing me that fearful planets like Sun, Mars and Rahu are encroaching my birth star."
"Whenever such inauspicious signs are produced, the king generally will get either death or a fearful accident."
"Oh, Rama! Hence, before my mind gets changed, get you anointed to the crown. Are
not the minds of men unstable?"
"Today, the moon is entering the constellation known as Punarvasu which comes before Pushyami star. The astrologers inform that the coronation ceremony can be fixed for tomorrow, when the moon joins Pushyami star."
"Hence, get anointed for the crown on the day of Pushyami star. My mind is urging me as it were to expedite things. O, annihilator of the enemies! I shall anoint you for the princely kingdom tomorrow."
"That is why, with self control, you along with your wife should observe fast for
this night from now onwards, and sleep on a couch made of Kusha grass."
"Generally, there are many obstacles for such type of functions. Hence, your friends should guard you vigilantly from all directions."
"It is my opinion that your coronation function should occur, while Bharata is away from the city."
" Bharata, your brother, goes according to his eldest brother. He is righteous,
compassionate and has the senses under control. He verily follows the path of good people."
"Oh, Rama! It is my opinion that minds of men are inconstant. But the ever
righteous, endowed with goodness, sometimes may act unexpectedly on impulse."
Dasaratha, after telling in this way about the ensuing coronation ceremony scheduled for the next day, permitted Rama to depart. Rama offered his salutations to his father and went to his house.
After hearing the decision of Dasaratha regarding coronation ceremony, Rama entered his house and by starting immediately, went to his mother's queenly house.
There, in the queen's worshipping place, Rama saw Kausalya silently in meditation, wearing silk clothes and praying to goddess Lakshmi.
Hearing the good news of the coronation ceremony of Rama, Sumitra and Lakshmana came there even before Seetha was brought.
At that time, Kausalya closed her eyes and was in meditation. Along with her,
Sumitra, Lakshmana and Seetha were sitting nearby.
Hearing that her son will be anointed for the princely kingdom on the day of
Pushyami star, Kausalya with controlled breath, was meditating on lord Vishnu.
Rama approached his mother, even while she was engaged in pious observance, offered salutation and spoke the following words making her delighted.
"Oh, mother! My father ordered that I should rule the people. As per his orders,
there will be anointing ceremony to me tomorrow."
"Seetha too, along with me should observe fast this whole night. The father together with preceptors and teachers said this to me."
"Have all the auspicious rites that are required for the ensuing tomorrow's
anointment ceremony, performed to me and to Seetha today."
Hearing the news of anointment ceremony, which was being desired by her for a long time, Kausalya spoke to Rama the following sweet words with tears of joy in her eyes.
"Oh, child Rama! You live a long life! Let your enemies be destroyed! Let the
cousins of mine and of Sumitra be made happy by your glory."
"O, my little son! You were born to me on a day of an auspicious star. That is why, your father king Dasaratha was propitiated by your virtues."
"O, son! My worship to the lotus eyed Lord Vishnu with endurance has become
fruitful. Hence, this glorious kingdom of Ikshvaku dynasty is going to embrace you."
Rama, after hearing the words spoken by his mother, saw his brother Lakshmana who
was sitting humbly nearby with joined palms and spoke to him smilingly as follows: "O, Lakshmana! You rule this earth together with me. This glorious kingdom has reached you, who are my second conscience."
"O, Lakshmana! You enjoy the benefits as desired by you and the fruits of kingdom. I desire to live and even to rule the kingdom but for you."
Rama, after speaking thus to Lakshmana, offered salutations to both the mothers, got Seetha to obtain permission from them and went to his house along with Seetha.After hearing the cruel words of Kaikeyi; King Dasaratha got disturbed and suffered great agony for a while.
"As it a day-dream or confusion of my mind? Or could it be an eclipse of my experience or a disease of the mind?"
Thinking over thus, the king could not make out on the spur of the moment what it was. 
Then, regaining consciousness, he felt tormented by Kaikeyi's words. Distressed and disgusted as a deer at the sight of a lioness and seated on the bare floor, he gave forth a long sigh like a highly venomous serpent fixed to a charmed spot through magic spells. Uttering words "what a pity!" the angry king fell into a swoon once more, his mind infatuated with grief.
Regaining consciousness after a long time and feeling much distressed and angry; the King spoke thus to Kaikeyi, as though consuming her with fire in his eyes
"Oh cruel woman of wicked conduct inclined to exterminate this race! What wrong has been done to you by Rama or by me?"
"When Rama is treating you in the same way as his mother, why are you bent upon harming only him?"
"By not knowing you as a female snake with fiery poison, you were admitted by me as princess in my house for my own self destruction."
"When all living beings extol the virtues of Rama, for what offence shall I forego my beloved son?"
"For what offence shall I forsake my beloved son; when the entire world of living beings extol the virtues of Rama?"
"Supreme delight comes to me on seeing my eldest son. My very consciousness is lost, if I fail to see Rama."
"The world can exist without the sun, a crop without water. But life cannot continue in my body, without Rama."
"Oh, sinful woman! Enough of it. Let this resolution be given up. I even touch your feet with my head. Be gracious to me."
"Oh, sinful woman! Why this most design has been conceived by you? If you wish to ascertain my kindly or unkindly feeling towards Bharata, let it be so. But the observation made by you earlier that glorious Rama, who is senior in the practice of virtue is my eldest son as it were, must have been uttered in order to coax me or to get service from him."
"Afflicted with grief by hearing Rama's proposed installation; you are tormenting me too much. Possessed by an evil spirit in a lonely house; you are subject to control of another" 
"Oh, queen! In this Ikshhvaaku race, which is rich in good conduct, this very great misfortune has appeared, due to which your mind has been perverted 
"Oh, large eyed one! Earlier you have not done anything unreasonable or repugnant to me. That is why; I do not believe what has been done by you."
"Indeed, Rama is on par with the great souled Bharata to you, for many times you were telling me stories illustrating this, Oh, young lady!"
"Oh, timid lady! How do you take delight in banishment for fourteen years of that pious-minded and illustrious Rama?"
"How do you take delight in the sojourn, in a most dreadful forest; of Rama with very delicate body and having his self held in piety?"
"Oh, the fair-eyed one! Why do you take delight in banishment of Rama, who is so pleasing to look at and who is so obediently doing service to you?"
"Rama always is doing service to you more than Bharata does. For that reason also, in your case, I do not see any speciality in Bharata."
In fact, who else other than Rama the best of men could do much more service to you with respect, with correct notion and in obedience?"
"No censure or calumny against Rama can come from the mouth of many of thousands of women or from numerous dependents maintained by me. Addressing gently all created beings with clear mind, Rama a tiger among men, captivates the people of his kingdom by his kind actions."
"Rama the valiant, conquers men by virtue, the poor through charity, the elders by service, the enemies in battle by his bow."
"Truthfulness, charity, austerity, sacrifice, purity, straight forwardness, learning, service to elders-these firmly established in Rama."
"Oh, Queen! How do you wish harm to that Rama who is richly endowed with honesty, who is equal to god and who is having splendour as of a great sage?"
"I do not remember an unkind word spoken by Rama, who always speaks kindly words to all. 
As such, how can I for your sake, break unpalatable news to Rama the beloved."
"What recourse is there for me other than Rama, in whom forgiveness, asceticism, self-denial, truthfulness, piety, gratitude and harmlessness towards living beings exist."
"Oh, Kaikeyi! You ought to bestow mercy to me, and old and miserable man who reached his end and is coaxing painfully to you"
"Whatever can be attained on earth, which has the sea an end, all that I can give you. 
Let not anger take possession of you "Oh, Kaikeyi! I fold my hands in salutation to you. I am even touching your feet. Be a protector of Rama. Let not unrighteousness lay hold on me in this matter."
The fierce Kaikeyi again spoke these fiercer words to Dasaratha, who was burning with sorrow and was wailing as aforesaid, who had fallen unconscious and was tossing about as he was filled with grief, and was praying again and again for being speedily borne across the sea of grief.
"Oh, Valiant king! Having again boons, if you repent again and again how can you proclaim piety on this earth?"
"Oh, knower of what is right! When many royal saints assemble and converse with you, what will be your reply?"
"Can you say" a wrong was done to Kaikeyi, on whose grace I am living now and who protected me earlier?"
"Oh, King! You having granted boons indeed today, now talk in another way, creating blemish on other kings"
When there was a dispute between a hawk and a pigeon (who were no other than Indra the ruler of gods and the god of fire respectively), the ruler of Sibis* gave away his own flesh to the bird and king Alarka* by parting with his eyes, attained to the highest destiny.
"The ocean, having given a promise, never crosses its limits. Therefore, bearing in mind the previous occurrences do not violate the pledge given by you to me."
"Oh, the evil-minded! By giving up righteousness and by installing Rama in the kingdom, you want to enjoy life with Kausalya forever."
"Let it be unrighteous or righteous, real or hoax. There should be no change in whatever is promised by you for me."
"If Rama is coroneted, I shall indeed die before your eyes by drinking abundant poison now itself in front of you."
"If I have to see Kausalya, the mother of Rama receiving salutations even for day, death is indeed better for me."
"Oh, King! I swear to you an oath by Bharata and by myself that I will not be pleased with anything else other than sending Rama to exile."
Kaikeyi spoke words of such extent and stopped. She did not further reply to the wailing.
Hearing Kaikeyi's boons, asking for Rama's exile and Bharata's sovereignty which are very much unwelcome, king Dasaratha nevertheless was perturbed for a while and did not move his lips towards Kaikeyi.
He kept gazing with unwinking eyes towards his beloved queen Kaikeyi, who spoke such disagreeable words. The king could not become comfortable on hearing that utterance, which was unkindly to his heart filling with pain and sorrow and was as terrible as a thunderbolt.
Reflecting over Kaikeyi's resolve and her terrible swearing, Dasaratha heaved a sigh, uttering "Rama" and fell like tree which was cut off.
Then the king become like mental a mad man who lost his equilibrium like an ailing man getting upset and like a serpent losing it's fierceness.
The king spoke to Kaikeyi in a distressed tone as follows "By whom have you been taught this worthless thing which appears to be worthwhile? Like a woman whose mind has been perverted by an evil spirit; you are not ashamed to speak to me."
"In the beginning, I was not knowing your wavery conduct in this way. But now, I am seeing it in you. It is perverted."
"From whom has such fear cropped up in you, so as to seek Bharata to be seated on the throne and Rama to stay in the forest?"
"If you want to do favour to your husband, to the world at large and to Bharata, you give up this sinful intention of sending Rama to exile."
"Oh, cruel! Petty minded woman of sinful resolve and wicked deed! Which grievance or offence are you finding in me or in Rama?"
"With out Rama, Bharata will not in any case take possession of the kingdom of Ayodhya as I think him to be stronger in virtue than even Rama."
"Having uttered the words 'proceed to the forest!' How can I behold the pale face of Rama resembling an eclipsed moon?"
"How can I see that reasonable view of mine, which was well made in consultation with friends and decided, being foiled like an army destroyed by enemies? What the kings who came from many directions, will speak about me? 'Alas', this king Dasaratha, a fool was ruling this kingdom for such a long time!"
"When many virtuous and learned elders enquire me about Rama, what then shall I tell them?"
"Even if I tell the truth that Rama was sent to forest by me, hard-pressed as I was by Kaikeyi, nobody will believe it and think as untruth."
"What will Kausalya say to me if Rama proceeds to forest? What can I, having done an unkind act, reply to her?"
"Oh, Kaikeyi! Whatever Kausalya, who was always desirous of showing kindness to me, who was blessed with a pet son, who speaks kind words and who deserves to be kindly treated, was waiting on me like a maid-servant, like a friend, like a wife, like a sister and like a mother. But, for your sake, she was never treated kindly by me."
"That which was done good be me for you, is hurting me now even as a meal taken with forbidden sauces fills an ailing person with repentance."
Being apprehensive of seeing Rama being treated with contempt and his exile to the forest, how will Sumitra put faith in me?"
"Seetha, alas, will hear woefully two unpleasant, of me having befallen to death and of Rama seeking refuge in the forest."
"Alas! Like a Kinnara girl bereft of her partner at the side of Himalayan hill, Seetha with her grief will make me lose my life."
"Seeing Rama dwelling in a great forest and Seetha lamenting, I cannot indeed desire to line."
"Oh, Kaikeyi! Deprived of your husband, you can as such rule the kingdom along with your son. It is indeed impossible for me to survive, after Rama's exile"
"I considered you, a good and virtuous wife as you are, proving to be perpetually bad wife, as one, having drunk wine with poison, though possessing an attractive appearance, concludes it to be obnoxious."
"You used to speak to me very consolingly with untruthful gentle words like a deer being killed by a hunter after enticing it with melodious sounds."
"Venerable people gathered in the streets will reproach me who has sold away my son, saying that I am as bad as a brahmana who drinks wine. It is certain."
"Alas! How was distressing and how painful it is that I have to forbear your words! I got this type of trouble as an evil consequence earned in a previous life."
"Like a rope used for hanging up one's neck through ignorance; Oh sinful woman; you have been lovingly maintained by me, sinful as I am"
"Enjoying life with you, I could not recognise you as death. I touched you, like cobra touched with hand by a child in a deserted place."
"This world of living beings is certainly fit to curse me, such as I am; saying that Rama the great souled is deprived of fatherly protection by me, the evil-minded."
Alas! Extremely foolish is king Dasaratha; whose mind is lustful for a woman and sent his son to the forest."
"Emaciated by vow's, by study of Vedas and by service to his preceptors, Rama will indeed during the period of enjoyment, again undergo a great hardship."
"My son Rama is incapable of saying a second word to me to go to forest, he will say "Be it so."
"If Rama does contrary to my command to go to forest, it will be most welcome to me. 
But, Rama the darling would never do so."
"Rama, who is pure minded; cannot indeed conjecture my way of thinking. Having been told to go to the forest, he will say "Be it so."
"On Rama reaching the forest, Death will take me, who is condemned by all men and unpardonable, to the abode of Yama the god of punishment."
"Rama the foremost among men-having left for the forest and I having been dead, what sinful act can you think of the remaining people beloved of me."
"The queen Kausalya, after losing me, Rama and sons Lakshmana and satrughna, will be enable to endure the woes and will follow me to the abode of Yama."
"Having thrown Kausalya, Sumitra along with three sons and myself into tortures of hell, you be happy!."
"Being abandoned by me and Rama, the Ikshhvaaku dynasty which was eternal, which was adorned with qualities, which could not be disturbed, will now be protected by you by bringing disorder."
"If it becomes agreeable to Bharata to send Rama to exile, let not Bharata do funeral rite to me, when life has departed."
"Alas! My adversary! Oh, vulgar lady, Kaikeyi! Become satisfied with your desires! When I am dead consequent on Rama, the foremost of men, having proceeded to forest, you a widow along with your son will then rule over the kingdom."
"You are residing in my house with the designation of a princess. All fame, which is unequalled in this world and lasting insult as well as disrespect of men will fall to my share as to a perpetrator of sins.
"How can my beloved son Rama, who was hitherto travelling as a Lord time again in chariots elephants and horses, will move on foot in a great forest?"
How will my sin; in whose dining time; cooks wearing ear-rings used to prepare excellent food and drinks trying to finish their work before others actually survive by eating astringent bitter and pungent wild foods?"
"How having worn costly robes, will Rama who is deserving of lasting comforts, be in brown-red clothing on this earth?"
"Whose terrific and thoughtless words are these of one demanding Rama's exile to forest and the other of Bharata's consecration as king?"
"Women of course are deceivers, even occupied with selfishness. Let them be condemned! 
Here, I am not mentioning of all women but of Bharata's mother only."
"Oh, cruel woman of evil intent; given to pursuit of your selfish ends, you have a settled disposition to bring grief to me. What a mischief do you expect through me or through Rama, who is always doing benefit to you?"
"On seeing Rama plunged in adversity fathers leave of their sons and wives too their husbands. Not, even the entire world gets exasperated."
"I, for one, rejoice by seeing that son Rama in the form of a divine boy, adorned with ornaments coming in proximity to me. By seeing him again and again, I get rejuvenated."
"Active life may not be possible even without sun or even Indra (the wielder of thunder bolt) not pouring rain. But, my opinion is that not even one will survive, by seeing Rama departing from here."
"I lodged in my house, as one would one's own mortal enemy, you, who seek my destruction and are unfriendly. Alas, due to ignorance, a highly venomous female serpent has been held on my lap so long and therefore I am undone."
"Bereft of me as also Rama and Lakshmana, let Bharata along with you, rule over the city and the state. After killing your relatives, bring delight to my enemies."
"Oh, cruel natured! One who has struck a blow in adversity! When you violently utter such words now, why the teeth from your mouth have not fallen down, breaking into thousands of pieces?"
"Rama does not speak a word which is even a little malevolent or unkindly. He does not know how to utter harsh words. How indeed are you recounting the faults of Rama, who talks beautifully and who is always admired for his virtues"
"Oh, Kaikeyi, the black guard of Keka dynasty! You may faint away or flare up or perish or enter the earth split up into thousands of cracks! I will not act on your word which is very cruel and inimical to me."
"I do not wish the survival of you, who are destructive like a razor, always speaking falsely pleasing words, are of evil natured, disastrous to the family, intent upon burning my heart along with vitals and repellent to my mind."
"There is no life to me without my son. How can there be happiness moreover? From whom else can there be joy, while I survive? Oh, queen! You ought not to do an unfriendly act to me. I even touch your feet. Be gracious to me."
That king, who has been gripped in the heart his by his wife, who transgressed all bounds of decorum, he wailing like a forlorn child and not reaching Kaikeyi's both the feet which were spread along, sank down like an ailing man.On the next dawn that heartened king Dasharatha who is with his teachers and his 
relatives then said this to his minister Sumantra. 
Now let the chancellors of exchequers draw ample riches, gems and numerous other 
items that are used in the marriage from bridegroom's side, all-inclusively, and 
let them travel in advance and let them be well-prepared for any exigency... 
Let the quadruple forces start off in a trice from everywhere at my order, and 
others shall start with unexcelled vehicles like palanquins, sedan chairs, litters 
etc., and with those that can be yoked with horses, like cabined-coaches and horse-carriages... 

"Vashishta, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali and Kaashyapa, and the long-lived Maarkandeya, and 
Sage Kaatyaayana... let these Brahmans travel in forefront... and let horses be 
yoked to my royal-cariole, and as the messengers of Janaka are hastening me arrange 
for the travel without time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha ordered. 
On the word of that best king the fourfold opulence, and even the fourfold forces 
up to some extent followed rearward of the king who is going after the sages who 
are going afore of him. 
Travelling on a four-day-route Dasharatha reached the fringes of Videha kingdom, 
and on hearing this, the illustrious king Janaka arranged for welcome ceremonies 
at the outskirts of the city. 
Then the king Janaka who is by far gladdened went into a state of ecstatic elation 
when he met the senescent king and paladin of people, namely Dasharatha, as the 
pace for the marriage celebrations is quickened because of the immediate arrival 
of Dasharatha. 
And the best one among men, king Janaka, gleefully said this commendable sentence 
to Dasharatha, the best legatee of Raghu, "oh, king, a hearty welcome to you. Oh, 
legatee of Raghu, your arrival to my city is just by my providence... you will now 
get delectation on seeing your sons who won accolades just by their valorousness 
in the act of raising and breaking Shiva's bow..." 
Providentially bechanced is the arrival of this great-resplendent and godly sage 
Vashishta, who arrived here with all of these eminent Brahmans, like Indra himself 
with all gods... 
Providentially my hindrances are overcome by the arrival of godlike sages, and 
providentially my lineage too is gloried owing to this hymeneal engagement with 
noble-souled Raghava-s, who are the most valorous among all the valorous people... 

Because you are born in first and foremost Ikshvaku dynasty, hence you are the 
Indra of Indra-like kings on earth... and hence, it will be apt of you to initiate 
the celebrations of marriage tomorrow, and the marriage itself after the culmination 
of the Vedic-ritual in three or four days, and the date and time for the marriage, 
that which is agreeable to the best sages can be decided, and you can get it performed 
on that date, through those great sages... 
On hearing that sentence of king Janaka the sententious king Dasharatha replied 
the king Janaka from amongst the sages. 
"Recipiency rests with the restitutor..." so I have heard earlier. Hence, whatever 
you say, for you are the knower of probity and nothing goes amiss in your astute 
thinking, that we will do... 
On listening that sentence of that affirmer of principles, namely Dasharatha, that 
which is conformable to the principles of marriages and familial glory, a thrill 
of joy came over the king of Videha. 
Then, on the foregathering of sages from Vashishta's side with the sages of Mithila 
all the sages have attained extreme joy and they spent that night happily. 
Then that most brilliant Rama, keeping Vishvamitra ahead, and strutting in step 
with Lakshmana, strutted to touch the feet of his father Dasharatha. 
On seeing his two sons, the super medallists in Raghu's dynasty, King Dasharatha 
is highly rejoiced and he resided in Mithila with a high contentment, for the reverence 
of Janaka is that high. 
Even the great-resplendent Janaka on performing ritual acts according to scriptures 
for the Vedic-ritual on hand, and the preparatory rituals for handing out both of 
his daughters in marriage, went into the sleep of the just, with his palm on his 
chest. On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for 
a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. 
""Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him 
with the demons. 
"Here is the full-fledged battalion, calledakShouhiNii senaa, 
for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter 
those demons. 
"Brave and daring are these soldiers of mine, and as experts in weaponry they are the appropriate 
ones to combat the hordes of demons, but, it will be ungentle of you to take Rama with you. 

"I alone with bow in my hand can protect your ritual, and as long as I bear my lives so long 
I war with those nightwalkers staying in the van of war. 
" I myself wish to come over there thereby the works of ritual will be well-guarded and unimpeded, 
but, taking Rama with you will be ungracious of you. 
"Why because, Rama is boy! And he is unschooled in his princely education; does he know the 
strengths and weaknesses of opponents - no; has he got the equipage of arsenal - no; has he 
any expertise in warfare - no; is he an equal to the demons - no; be that as it may, those 
demons definitely conduct a deceitful warfare, isn't it. 
"Alienated from Rama I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, tigerly sage, hence taking 
Rama with you will be unjust. 
"Otherwise, oh, Brahman with best vows, if you so wish to take Rama along with you, you lead 
him off along with me, and along with my four kinds of troops. 
"Sixty thousand years have passed from my birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered 
at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate 
of you. 
"I will have exceptional affection for all of my four sons, isn't it, and among them Rama 
has a significance in the matter of his descent as an eldest son, hence taking Rama with you 
will be unjust of you. 
"Oh, eminent sage, of what fortitude are those demons? Whose sons are they? Who are they? 
How is their size and shape? Also who protects all of them? 
"Oh, Brahman, how Rama, or my forces, or I myself have to retaliate those demons that are 
deceitful militants. 
"Tell me all that, oh, god, how I have to carry on when warring with those evil minded demons, 
for the demons will be delirious by their audacity, isn't it..." Thus Dasharatha asked Vishvamitra 
insistently. On hearing those words Sage Vishvamitra replied this way. 
"One born in Paulastya dynasty, an extremely mighty and exceedingly brave demon named Ravana 
is there, and he with the boon given by Brahma, and accompanied with many other demons is 
torturing the triad of worlds, contemptuously. 
"Unequivocally that chief of demons is the brother of Kubera and the son of sage Vishravasa, 
thus we hear. 
"That formidable Ravana is not a devastator of rituals by himself, even so, two very mighty 
demons called Mareecha and Subaahu will cause devastating hindrances to rituals, instigated 
by him." Thus Sage Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. 
Thus when he is said so by that sage Vishvamitra, then the king Dasharatha spoke to the sage, 
"I myself am not capable of standing against that evil minded Ravana, in truth, where is the 
question of deputing my young Rama to confront him? 
"You are the knower of probity, such as you are, you may please bestow benevolence upon my 
boyish son, as well on a less fortunate one like me too, and as our mentor you are indeed 
a god of ours. 
"Gods, demons, celestial beings like gandharva-s, yaksha-s, winged and reptile beings 
are incapable to bear the brunt of that Ravana in fight, why tell again about humans. 
"But that Ravana depletes the valour of valorous opponents in a battle, oh, eminent sage, 
either with my entire forces, or with all my sons I am inadequate to grapple with all his 
forces, or with him, individually. 
"My boyish son is godlike and unfledged in warfare, oh, Brahman, and he is the one who alleviates 
me frompunnama narakathe hell of sonless fathers... no, I cannot 
spare my son in anyway. 
"Further, those saboteurs of your ritual namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are similar to Death-god 
and the descendents of the earliest demons and subverters of rituals, namely Sunda and Upasunda, 
no, I cannot spare my son, in any case. 
"Mareecha and Subaahu are well-trained and valorous ones, hence I will proceed with all my 
friendly forces to war with either of those two demons, otherwise, I along with all my relatives 
implore upon you for your exoneration in my failure to comply my own promises. 
Thus, by the incongruous talk of Dasharatha, the outstanding Brahman and son of Sage Kushi, 
namely sage Vishvamitra is overwhelmed with outrageous anger by his mentation, and that fire-like 
glorious sage looked like the ritual fire into which many inflammable oblations are offered, 
and which is drenched with a lot of clarified butter, whereby it is flaring up its tongues. 
Hearing the words of the evil-minded Ravana, who was thus lamenting, as he was
overcome with grief, Trishira (one of his sons) spoke as follows:
"Truly in such a manner, the highly valiant Kumbhakarna, (the middle of our father
and uncles) has been killed. But good persons like you do not lament as you are doing, O king!"
"O Lord! You are capable of conquering even the three worlds. Why are you, as such,
lamenting about yourself, as a common person?"
"You do continue to have a javelin given by Brahma, an armour, a bow and an arrow
together with a chariot yoked to a thousand donkeys, emitting a sound resembling the rumbling of a
cloud."
"The celestials and giants were indeed destroyed several times by you with your
various types of weapons. As such, you can punish Rama, when endowed with all weapons."
"You stay on, O monarch! I will set out and eradicate your enemies in battle, as
Garuda the eagle eradicates the serpents."
"Beaten down by me, as Shambara by Indra and Naraka* by Vishnu, I will lay down Rama
today in battle."
Hearing the words of Trishira, Ravana the king of demons considered himself as
though born anew, after being summoned by Death.
Hearing the words of Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka and the energetic Atikaya were
rejoiced of war.
Then, the brave Ravana's sons, whose prowess was equal to Indra and the foremost of
demons, roared asserting their superiority saying "I will lead, I will lead!"
All of them wee capable of passing through the sky. All were skilled in magic. All
had humbled the pride of gods. All were fierce in battle.
All were endowed with great strength. All were widely renowned. All were such as had
never been heard of having been conquered by celestials or Gandharvas or Kinnaras or large serpents
while encountering a battle.
All the demons were valiant ones, well-versed in weaponry. All were skilled in
war-fare. All were greatly knowledgeable and all had obtained boons.
That Ravana the king, surrounded by his sons, who were radiant as the sun and who
tormented the strength and fortune of the enemies, shone like Indra surrounded by celestials who
can destroy the pride of gigantic demons.
Embracing his sons, embellishing them with ornaments and blessing them profusely,
Ravana sent them to battle.
For the defense of his sons, Ravana sent Yuddhonmatta and Matta (better known as
Mahodara and Mahaparshva), his brothers to the battle.
Those demons with colossal bodies, paid obeisance (by circumambulating) to Ravana
(who caused the people to cry in terror) and departed.
Anointing their bodies with all types of herbs and perfumes, those six mighty and
excellent demons went away, eager to fight.
Trishira, Atikaya, Devantaka, Narantaka, Mahodara and Mahaparshva, under the clout
of destiny; set out for the battle.
Thereupon, Mahodara mounted an elephant called Sudarshana, like unto a dark-cloud
and born in Airavata-race.
That Mahodara, adorned with quivers, endowed with all types of armoury and mounting
the elephant, shone like the sun on the peak of Ashtachala mountain.
Trishira, the son of Ravana, ascended an exquisite chariot, yoked to excellent
horses and filled with all types of armoury.
Trishira, wielding a bow and mounting the chariot, shone like a cloud with
glittering meteors, illuminations and a rain-bow.
That Trishira with three diadems in that exquisite chariot, stood out like Mount
Himavat, the king of mountains with its three golden hills.
Then, Atikaya, having very fiery energy, the son of Ravana and the foremost among
the wielders of bow, mounted an excellent chariot.
Atikaya mounted that chariot, having first-rate wheels and axles, well-yoked, having
a good carriage and pole, filled with quivers and bows and flashingly full of missiles, swords and
maces.
He was radiant with his diadem, shining in brilliant gold and other ornaments, like
Mount Meru, causing to shine with its splendours (by the sun).
In that chariot, Atikaya that mighty prince, surrounded by the foremost of demons,
shone like Indra surrounded by celestials.
Narantaka mounted a white gigantic horse, similar to Uchchaishrava (the mount of
Indra), adorned with gold ornaments and as swift as thought.
Narantaka, holding a javelin, which was resplendent like a meteor, appeared shining,
like Guha (the offspring of Shiva) holding a spear and riding a beautiful peacock.
Devantaka, holding a glided iron-bar, marched ahead, resembling an incarnation of
Vishnu holding Mandara-mountain in his arms.
Mahaparshva, possessing a great splendour and vigour and wielding a mace in his arm
in battle, looked like Kubera the lord of wealth.
Those distinguished demons set out from. Lanka, like the gods leaving Amaravati.
Mighty demons, holding excellent weaponry, accompanied them, mounting on elephants, horses and
chariots making sounds of rumbling clouds.
Those mighty princes, having sun's brilliance, wearing diadems and possessed of
prosperity, shone like glowing planets in the sky.
The row of auspicious attire worn by them, shone like an autumnal cloud or like a
flock of cranes in the sky.
Determined either to die or to vanquish their enemies, those valiant demons went
forward, thus making their courageous resolve, eager to fight.
Those mighty demons set out with a mad conception of war, roared and made a
reverberatory sound, took up arrows and dispatched them.
The earth trembled as it were, by their battle-cries and clapping of arms. The sky
appeared breached, by the lion's roars of the demons.
Those mighty leaders of demons, having set out, were delighted to see the army of
monkeys having uplifted rocks as their weapons.
The mighty monkeys too saw that army of demons, which appeared like a black cloud
but blazing like fire and sun on all sides, abounding with elephants, horses and chariots, made to
resound with hundreds of small bells and wielding well-raised great weaponry.
Seeing that army which arrived and as they got the target for their fight, the
monkeys, having the great mountains uplifted, roared again and again. The monkeys, not tolerating
the demons, thus shouted, standing opposite to them.
Hearing the enhanced noise of the leaders of the army of monkeys, the troops of
demons who were terrible in might, not tolerating the rejoice of the enemies, then made a noise
more terribly.
Entering that terrific army of demons, those monkey-leaders, with their raised
mountains, roamed about like mountains with their peaks.
Some monkeys entering the sky and some others enraged, staying on earth with trees
and rocks as their weapons, wandered among the army of demons.
The foremost among the monkeys, holding trees, having extensive branches, roamed
about in the battle-field. That battle-front, filled with demons and monkeys, looked terrific.
Those monkeys, of terrific prowess, though impeded by a flood of arrows, initiated a
matchless rain of trees, rocks and mountains.
In the battle, the demons and the monkeys made a noise of lion's roars. The monkeys
pounded the demons with rocks.
The enraged monkeys killed demons wearing armours and ornaments. Some killed valiant
demons, sitting or standing in chariots and also those demons mounted on elephants and horses.
Valiant monkeys struck the demons vehemently. Those foremost of demons trembled, as
their bodies were attacked by mountain-peaks and blows of fists, down and roared.
Those demons also pierced the foremost of monkeys with sharp arrows, striking them
with spears mallets, swords, javelins and lances.
There, the monkeys and demons having their limbs smeared with the blood of their
foes, mowed each other with a desire to conquer each other.
Thereupon, within an instant, the battle-field became dampened with blood and
covered by the mountains and swords thrown by the monkeys and demons.
Then the battle-field became filled with dead bodies of demons, who had an ardent
passion for battle, having their colossal bodies devastated and scattered all over.
The demons, already thrown down and still being thrown down, with their spears
broken by the monkeys at that time, approached the monkeys and carried out a wonderful combat with
their limbs, arms and legs.
Those foremost of demons struck the monkeys with their own corpses and the monkeys
also struck the titans with their own dead bodies.
Then, grabbing the rocks and mountains, those titans struck the monkeys with them.
The apes too, snatching away their weapons, struck the titans.
The monkeys and demons fractured each other with crags and made a noise with lion's
roars.
The titans, having their armours broken, as struck by the apes, emitted blood at
that place, like trees oozing their sap.
Some monkeys in the battle-front destroyed chariot with chariots, elephants with the
very elephants and horse by the very horses.
The titans broke the trees and rocks of monkey-chiefs with their sharp arrows with
their hoe-shaped head, those arrows with crescent-shaped head and those with spear-like head.
The battle-field, filled with those mountains, broken trees and dead bodies of apes
and titans, became difficult to be traversed.
Reaching the battle-field and abandoning their fear, all those monkeys, with their
thrilling martial arts full of pride, nay, who were having various weapons (like trees, rocks,
teeth and nails) and unrepressed in spirit, carried out battle with the demons.
Seeing the monkeys rejoicing in that tumultuous battle which commenced and the
demons falling down, the great sages and troop of celestials emitted shouts of triumph.
Meanwhile, mounting on a horse having speed equal to the wind, and taking a barbed
javelin, Narantaka entered the terrific army of monkeys, as a fish entering the ocean.
That valiant and mighty Narantaka, the enemy of Indra, single-handedly within an
instant, rent asunder seven hundred monkeys with that shining javelin and killed that army of the
foremost of monkeys.
Vidyadharas, the super natural beings and great sages, saw the mighty Narantaka,
seated on the back of a horse and hacking a path way for himself through the army of monkeys.
His path-way was covered with a mire of flesh and blood, along with heaps of
fallen-down dead-bodes of monkeys, looking like hills.
Whenever the foremost of the monkeys thought of showing their valour, so often
Narantaka overtook and cleaved them.
He burn away the army of monkeys, as the fire burns away the forests. Even before
the monkeys get time to uplift the trees and mountains, the javelin struck them and they fell down,
as mountains riven by lightning.
That mighty Narantaka, the destroyer of men, roamed in all directions in the
battle-field, holding up his shiny javelin, ravaging in all directions like the wind ravaging the
earth in a rainy season.
Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys with
his javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth.
Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys with
his javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth.
Those monkeys were unable to tolerate the down-onslaught of the javelin, which was
similar to the striking of a thunderbolt and they shouted with a great uproar.
The images of the falling monkeys were flashing like those of falling mountains,
with their peaks shattered by a thunderbolt.
Those great-souled and the foremost of monkeys, who were earlier thrown down by
Kumbhakarna, regained their self and approached Sugreeva.
That Sugreeva, while looking on, saw the army of monkeys running away hither and
thither, as they were tormented of the fear of Narantaka.
To that Sugreeva who was seeing his army running away, Narantaka appeared, coming
seated on the back of a horse, holding a javelin in his hand.
After seeing Narantaka, the vastly splendoured Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spoke
thus, to Angada, the valiant prince, having a prowess equal to Indra's (as follows):
"Go out and quickly detach the lives of this valiant demon, who is riding a horse
and consuming the army of his enemies."
Hearing the words of Sugreeva his sovereign, that valiant Angada then came bouncing
from his army, as the sun coming out of a cloud.
Angada the excellent of monkeys, resembling a rocky mass, wearing bracelets on his
upper arms, looked brilliant like a mountain with its metallic streaks.
Angada the son of Vali, bereft of arms but only nails and teeth besides having a
great splendour, approached Narantaka and spoke the following words:
"Stop! What can you do with these common monkeys? Throw your javelin, having the
sensation equal to a thunderbolt, towards my chest."
Hearing the words of Angada, Narantaka was very much enraged. The enraged Narantaka,
tightly biting his lip with his teeth, hissing like a serpent, approaching Angada and firmly
holding that highly radiant javelin, then quickly released it towards Angada. That javelin broke
against Angada's chest, that was as hard as a diamond and fell to the earth.
Then seeing his javelin shattered, like a serpent whose powerful coils were cut off
by Garuda the eagle, Angada stretched out his palm and struck the head of the horse.
That mountain-like Narantaka's horse, struck by a blow of the palm, had its head
shattered, feet broken, eyes and pupils put out and tongue come out. It fell down on the earth.
Seeing his horse fallen down dead, Narantaka was enraged. Raising his fist, that
exceedingly powerful Narantaka in battle struck Angada on his head.
Then, Angada having his head shattered by the blow of the fist, heavily oozed out
very hot blood, repeatedly felt a burning sensation and swooned. On regaining consciousness, he was
surprised.
Thereupon, the great-souled Angada, the son of Vali, clinching his fist and then
with a force equal to death, rushed it against the chest of Narantaka.
Having his chest deeply sunk back by that fist-blow, giving out flames and with his
limbs smeared by blood, that Narantaka fell down as a mountain is broken up by the fall of a
thundr-bolt.
When that Narantaka of great prowess was killed by Angada in battle, the chiefs of
celestials and the monkeys too then emitted a great roar of triumph in the sky.
Then, that Angada, who showed that forcible means, which was very difficult to do,
and which rejoiced Rama's intellect. So much so, Angada too was surprised. Thereupon Angada, of
terrible acts, was infused with vigour and again showed enthusiasm in battle.That Hanuma the courageous one, the son of Lord Vayu, saw the great aerial plane
standing in the middle of that building with a surprising hue, due to diamonds, and gems decorated
by series of refined gold.
That plane shone like the symbol for the solar path standing in the aerial path obtaining
the sky. Manufactured by Vishvakarma himself and praised by him as one without comparison in
beauty.
In that plane, there is not even a small thing that is not made with great effort, in
that there is nothing without the best diamonds, those characteristics are not in Devas
also, in that, there is nothing that is not of great significance.
One that has been obtained by austerities and by prowess, one that moves about by
thoughts of concentrated mind, made from various significant parts with an appearance of parts of
equal significance, collected from here and there from all over the world.
Obtaining a special construction as a special object, like a mountain with wonderful
peaks adorned by many peaks, attractive to the soul, calm like an autumnal moon, like the peak of a
mountain with other wonderful small peaks.
Hanuma saw that aerial plane with rakshasas who were great eaters, with a face
beautified by earnings, who roamed around in the sky, and thousands of genii with round eyes,
crooked eyes and wide eyes capable of great speed carrying it.
That Hanuma the best among Vanara warriors saw there a best plane with the name of
Pushpaka with a more beautiful appearance than a group of flowers during spring, a more attractive
appearance than even the spring season.
Thus, this is the th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.Beholding the demon, Dhumraksha of terrible prowess coming forth, all the monkeys
waiting for the war, roared with joy.
A highly tumultuous battle was seen between those monkeys and demons, who were
slaying each other, with terrible trees, lances and maces.
The terrible monkeys were moved down on all sides by the demons. The demon too were
levelled down to the earth with trees by the monkeys.
Enraged with anger, the demons, on their part, paralyzed the monkeys with sharp and
frightful arrows, going as straight as wings of eagle.
While being torn asunder by the demons with terrible maces, spears, hammers,
frightful iron bars and variegated tridents, the mighty monkeys fearlessly accomplished their tasks
with an excitement born of anger.
While their bodies were split up by the tridents and their limbs broken by arrows,
those leaders of monkeys took up trees and rocks there to fight.
Those terribly swift monkeys, roaring aloud harassed the valiant demons at all
places, by calling out their names.
That awful battle with all kinds of rocks and trees furnished with many branches
between monkeys and demons appeared wonderful.
Some demons were crushed by monkeys, who conquered fear and some blood-sucking
demons vomited blood from their mouths.
Some demons were slashed open at their sides. Some were formed into a heap by the
trees. Some others were crushed by stones and yet others torn to pieces by the monkeys teeth.
With their standards crushed and broken, their swords snapped and their chariots
overturned, some demons were perturbed.
Crushed by the great rocks of monkeys, the earth was scattered with corpses of great
elephants resembling hills and horses with their riders.
The monkeys of terrific prowess rushed upon the demons, flinging themselves upon
them with great bounds horizontically and vertically and scratching their faces with their sharp
nails.
With their faces dejected very much, their hair torn out and maddened by the smell
of blood, those demons fell on the ground.
Some other demons of exceeding valour, who were enraged, very much, ran up towards
the monkeys to attack them with their palms having a diamond-like blow.
The monkeys, receiving that sharp shock, with even a greater ferocity, crushed the
demons with blows of their fists, feet teeth and trees.
Seeing his army routed, Dhumraksha that lion among the demons, in his anger began to
create a blood-shed of the monkeys wishing to fight.
Some monkeys pierced with spears lost rivers of blood while others struck down by
blows of axe, fell to the earth's surface.
Some were crushed by iron bars, others torn by harpoons, some others pierced by
javelins, all exhausted and lost their lives.
Slain in battle by infuriated demons, some monkeys, drenched with blood, fell on the
ground and some others disappeared, having been driven away.
With pierced hearts, some monkeys were made to lie down on one side. Some were torn
asunder by tridents that even their intestines came out.
That mighty battle assumed most awful proportions in that monkeys and demons were
crammed with rocks, trees and multitude of weapons.
With the bow-strings as the tuneful lute, the neighing of horses as a measure rhythm
and the trumpeting of elephants as the vocal music, the whole battle resembled a symphony.
Dhumraksha on his part, wielding a bow in his hand and laughing at the battle-front,
made those monkeys to run away to all the quarters by a shower of his arrows.
Seeing the army perturbed due to tormented by Dhumraksha, Hanuman was enraged and
turned towards him, taking a gigantic rock in his hands.
Hanuman, who was equal in strength to his father, with his eyes inflamed with anger,
flung the rock on the chariot of Dhumraksha.
Beholding the befalling rock, Dhumraksha lifting his mace hurriedly, jumped down
speedily from the chariot and stood there on the earth.
Shattering his chariot with its wheels, its pole, its crest along with banner and
bows, that rock rolled down to the ground.
Thereafter, Hanuman the son of Maruta (the wind-god), after breaking the chariot,
destroyed the demons with trunks of trees furnished with their branches.
With their heads crushed, the demons were drenched with blood. Some others were
crunched by the trees and fell down to the earth.
Having driven away the army of demons, Hanuma born of Maruta, breaking off the peak
of a mountain, ran towards Dhumraksha.
The valiant Dhumraksha lifted his mace and making a roaring sound, ran towards that
Hanuman who was rushing on him suddenly.
Thereafter, Dhumraksha with an outrage, brought down that mace studded with
countless spikes on the head of that Hanuma.
That Hanuman, who was endowed with an energy similar to the wind, was in no way
disturbed by that blow but struck Dhumraksha on the middle of his skull with his rocky peak.
That Dhumraksha, struck by the rocky peak, which shattered all his limbs, soon fell
down on the ground like a mountain crumbling.
Seeing Dhumraksha having been killed, the demons left surviving were frightened of
being killled by the monkeys and re entered Lanka.
That illustrious Hanuman the son of Pavana having destroyed his enemies, causing
rivers of blood to flow, weary of slaughter of the enemies, with delight, received the cordial
felicitations by the monkeys.That tumultuous sound, set up by the monkeys who were full of martial ardour,
arrested the attention of Ravana and his demons.
Hearing that mighty clamour, sounding smooth and deep, Ravana spoke to his ministers
who surrounded him.
"A great uproar, resembling the rumbling of clouds, has arisen from that horde of
rejoiced monkeys. Undoubtedly their joy is great, their mighty roars are agitating the briny ocean
itself.
"Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana were tied by sharp arrows. This sound of a
great magnitude being heard by me, is begetting an apprehension in me."
Having spoken thus to his ministers, Ravana the Lord of Demons said to his demons
who stood round him there (as follows)
"You immediately discover from what cause this general rejoicing among all these
monkeys coming for the their present grievous situation!'
Thus commanded by Ravana, they mounted the rampart very briskly and saw the army
lead by the high-souled Sugreeva and also the highly fortunate Rama and Lakshmana who were relieved
of the terrific shackle of arrow a and risen up together. All the demons felt desponded on seeing
it.
With their hearts trembling with fear and faces turning pale, all those terrific
demons descended from the rampart and approached Ravana.
With downcast faces, those demons skilled in speech, faithfully informed Ravana of
those unpleasant tidings, saying:
"The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, whom Indrajit had bound with his benumbing
shafts and whose arms he had pinioned, are free from the arrows which paralyzed them and now appear
on the field of battle, as two strong elephants who have snapped their fetters."
Hearing their words, the might Ravana was filled with anxiety and fury. His face
became pale (and he spoke as follows):
"If my adversaries, having thus been bound by Indrajit are freed, despite their
injuries in battle by his formidable arrows which were infallible those rare boons, resembling
serpents, bright as the sun, I perceive my entire army in jeopardy."
"Those very arrows, bright as fire, which in battle have taken the life of my
enemies, have now been rendered void indeed!"
Having spoken thus in furious tones, hissing like a snake, he addressed a demon
called Dhumraksha who was seated amidst the demons and said.
"You, with a terrific prowess, go quickly with a considerable force of demons and
slay Rama, Lakshmana and his monkeys."
Thus commanded by Ravana, the intelligent Dhumraksha, going past from there, quickly
departed front her royal palace.
Having crossed that gate, he spoke to the General of the Forces as follows:
"Mobilize the army. Hasten quickly. What need is there for the delay?"
Hearing the words of Dhumraksha, the general of forces, having the army which
followed him, kept the army ready quickly, as per Ravana's command.
Those strong demons of terrific form, making sounds with bells hung on their bodies,
joyously surrounded Dhumraksha.
Furnished with every kind of weapon, brandishing spears, hammers, maces, harpoons,
sticks, iron cudgels, bars, clubs, javelins, missiles, nooses and axes, those terrible demons
sallied forth with the noise of thunder.
Clad in mail, mounted on chariots that were magnificently dressed with flags and
decorated with bands of pure gold, harnessed to mules of many heads or steeds of exceeding
fleetness or elephants in furious rut, some other excellent demons went forth like veritable
tigers.
Dhumraksha, with a mule-like clatter, set out in a celestial chariot to which mules
adorned with gold and heads of deer and lions were hitched.
That Dhumraksha of mighty prowess, surrounded by demons, set forth amidst mocking
laughter, through the western gate where the army-chief Hanuman was stationed.
As he mounted and advanced in an excellent chariot harnessed to mules, whose voices
he emulated, birds of ill-omen in the sky obstructed that advancing demon of very terrible and
fearful appearance.
A highly terrible vulture alighted on the top of his chariot, while those devourers
of corpses clustered on the point of his standard.
Streming with blood, a huge decapitated trunk fell to earth, emitting inarticulate
noise in Dhumraksha's vicinity and the sky rained down blood. The earth trembled.
The wind with noise resembling a thunder blew adversely. Every quarter, obscured by
abundant darkness, did not dazzle.
Seeing those terrible amones that appeared in all their horror to the demons,
Dhumraksha became perturbed. Terror seized all the demons who were advancing in front of
Dhumraksha.
Then, Dhumraksha, the highly terrible and strong demon, surrounded by a multitude of
demons, eager to enter into combat, set out and beheld that army of a multitude of monkeys,
resembling a flood, protected by the arms of Rama.Rama along with Soumitri is well revered by Sage Suteekhsna, spent that night there and awoken in the 
morning. 
Rama got up according to time along with Seetha and touched finely cool water with lotus-fragrance for 
morning bath. 
Then they all, Vaidehi, Rama and Lakshmana, on worshipping sacred fire and deities dutifully in the 
shelter of the sages in that forest and on seeing the dawning sun, they are reft of their blemishes, 
and then they approached Sage Suteekshna speaking this sentence gently. 
"We stayed here happily, oh, god, venerated by a venerable one like you, and here we come to ask your 
permission as we wish to journey on, as the sages are hastening us... 
"We make haste to see the habitats of hermitages in their entirety, and even wish to see the sages with 
meritorious selves living in Dandaka forest... 
"We wish to have your permission, and that of these eminent sages, who are ever virtuous, self-controlled 
by their ascesis, and who look like the veritable tongues of sacred fire... 
"We wish to proceed before sun attains an intolerable glare, like an unworthy person of unworthy lineage 
attains wealth in an improper way with much glare..." saying so Rama with Seetha and Lakshmana venerated 
at the feet of that sage Suteekshna. 
That eminent sage lifted them that are touching his feet, embraced them tightly, and said this sentence 
in all his friendliness. 
"Proceed in an invulnerable way, Rama, along with Lakshmana, and with this Seetha while she follows 
you closely like a shadow... 
"See the pleasant thresholds of the hermitages of the dwellers in the forests of Dandaka, oh! Valiant 
one, whose souls are consecrated just by their ascesis... 
"See the well-flowered woodlands with well-grown fruits and tubers, with herds of best animals and 
peaceful bird flocks... tranquil waters with spreading clusters of bloomed lotuses and water-birds in 
the pools and lakes... eye-pleasing rapids from mountains and you can see pleasant forests loaded with 
the hearty screams of precooks... 
"My dear Rama, you may go and Soumitri you too also may go... but come again towards this hermitage 
after seeing all of them... 
Thus said by the sage, Rama in his turn said to him, "so be it..." and having performed circumambulations 
around the sage he started to journey on. 
Then the broad eyed Seetha gave auspicious quivers and bows to those brothers and then spotless swords 
too. 
Both of those two Rama and Lakshmana tied their beautiful quivers well on their backs, and took the 
twangy bows and exited from that hermitage to go on their way. 
Those two Raghava-s, the handsome princes, have swiftly set out when permitted by that august sage, 
wielding bows and swords, and along with Seetha. On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best 
man's son who is firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage. 

"Upon my father's order, upon my honour to my father's word, and looking upon this 
as the word of sage Kushi's son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented. 

"What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, 
that word too cannot be disregarded. 
"Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according 
as the follower of father's words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma 
scholar, such as your are, without a doubt. 
"I am ready to effectuate the bidding of an inestimable sage like you, for the welfare 
of cows and Brahmans, and for the advantage of this province." So said Rama to sage 
Vishvamitra. 
Saying thus, Rama, the enemy-destroyer, clenched his left fist on the handgrip in 
the middle of the bow, and with the right he made a thunderous sound of the bowstring 
making all the directions to blast. 
By that sound the inhabitants of Tataka forest are startled, and even Tataka is 
stupefied by that sound, and she is intolerably infuriated at it. 
She who is convulsed in anger to hear that sound gave attention to the direction 
wherefrom it emerged and she rancorously rushed thereto. 
Raghava on seeing that monstrous-looking demoness with a distorted face and who 
by proportions is very gigantic, furthermore infuriated, spoke to Lakshmana. 
"Lakshmana, see that yakshii's grisly and ghastly physique, seeing which hearts 
of cowards are prone to burst. 
" She is unstoppable and has magical powers, is't, you may see now how I will make 
her to readily retreat by lopping off her ears and the tip of nose. 
"As it is her femininess is protecting her, and I too I do not really attempt 
to kill her, but I intend to terminate her impudence and mobility. 
While Rama is still speaking that way, convulsed in anger Tataka roaringly rushed 
towards Rama alone, swinging her arms. 
But the Brahma-sage Vishvamitra daunted sounded her off and said to Rama and Lakshmana, 
"let you be safe, and be victorious." 
Flinging up dreadful dust on those two Raghavaa-s, Tataka baffled them for a while 
with a massive cloud of dust. 
Then taking hold of witchery she inundated both the Raghava-s with highly torrential 
stone rain, by which Rama became indignant. 
On forestalling her effusive stone storming with his arrow storm, Rama even mutilated 
both of her arms with arrows while she rushed towards them. 
With her arms severed and fatigued she started to roar extremely at the nearby, 
and then provoked Lakshmana made her to loose her ears and the tip of nose by cutting 
them off. 
That guise changer vanished after variously altering her aspects, and then on baffling 
them with her illusoriness and discharging stone storms she moved about appallingly. 

And on seeing both Rama and Lakshmana who are being overspread by storms of stones 
from all-over, then the illustrious sage Vishvamitra spoke this sentence. 
"Enough is your compassion Rama, she is a sinister, behaviourally malevolent, a 
hinderer of rituals, and this yakshii gets a grip on herself in a short time by 
her illusory powers. 
"Sun is going to set in a short time, and only before that time she shall be destroyed, 
for demons at dusk and afterwards become unassailable, indeed." So said sage Viswamitra 
to Rama. 
When Vishvamitra addressed him thus, Rama displaying his capacity in sonic archery 
forestalled that yakshii who has gone into invisibility and storming stone-storms, 
with his arrows. 
And when the arrays of arrows obstructed her who possesses illusional powers, she 
dashed towards Rama and Lakshmana blaring stridently. 
And Rama struck an arrow in her chest who is invading and speedily swooping down 
like a thunderbolt, and thus she is readily felled down and totally dropped dead, 
too. 
On seeing her who is horrendous in her shape is  eliminated, Indra and other gods 
have highly esteemed Rama saying, admirable, admirable is this act. 
The thousand eyed and the destroyer of enemy?s citadels Indra then spoke with high 
satisfaction, and even all of the gods are gladdened and said to Vishvamitra this 
way. 
"Oh, sage Vishvamitra, you are blessed, all the groups of wind-gods along with Indra 
are pleased, so you please show more concern for Raghava. 
"The sons of Prajapati Krishasva who are valiant by their virtue and who possess 
ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava. 
"Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver 
of those missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods. 
So said gods to Vishvamitra. 
All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned 
to heavens, and then the sunset has come to pass. 
That best sage is satisfied with Rama and gladdened for the eradication of Tataka 
kissed the forehead of and then said this sentence. 
"Here we stay for tonight, Rama, the august one for a gaze, and tomorrow morning 
we will go to that hermitage of mine. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. 
On listening sage Vishvamitra's words, Dasharatha's son Rama, comfortably stayed 
that night there in that forest of Tataka. 
On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and 
it shone forth like the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha. 

Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete 
elimination of yaksha's daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage 
only to be awakened by the next day's sunrise. On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him out of temper, without 
assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of virtue following the protocol 
of righteous war. 
"So, this is all the strength of yours and your army that is displayed and nothing more to display, 
is it! You wretched demon, it is paltriest compared to my strength, yet you vaunt aloud futilely! 
"This mace of yours in which you repose your bombastic aplomb, now completely battered with my arrows 
has gone onto the surface of earth, so also is your vanity. 
"What that is said by you, 'I will dab the tears of the demons whose kinfolk are dead here...' even 
this word of yours is a fake. 
"In boasting you are knavish, in character roguish, and in behaviour ghoulish, such a demon as you are, 
I will take your life away as the Divine Eagle Garuda took away Ambrosia. 
"Now, my arrows will rip and chop off your throat, and then the earth will guzzle the blood gushed therefrom 
garnished with froth and foam. 
"You will go to eternal sleep embracing the earth as you embrace an un-gainable lady, when both of your 
arms are knocked down to slide on earth, and limbs smeared with dirt. 
"While you are in profound sleep, oh, notorious demon, this Dandaka forest becomes a shelter to the 
shelter-worthy sages and saints. 
"When the strongholds of demons in your Janasthaana are ruined with my arrows, the sages in this forest 
will move about everywhere, fearlessly. 
"The demonesses who terrorized others so far will be pitiably terrorised now, and they flee away very 
quickly with tear-wet faces as their kinsmen are killed. 
"To which demonesses your kind of grievous demon is the husband, they must have taken birth in a befittingly 
grievous family like that of yours, and must be well-matched to you in grievous atrocities, and though 
they might not have tasted a grievous situation so far, since their lives have become meaningless, now 
they will become the enjoyers of the empathy of grief. 
"You are atrocious in conduct because you countervail against Veda-s, debased by conscience because 
you counteract to Vedic rituals, and you are countermanding Vedic procedures because you have always 
been bothersome to Brahmans, and those Brahmans becoming sceptical of your deeds of hindrance, they 
are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be swiftly dropped into fire to 
the chants of hymns and even on time, hence you are countervailing against Veda-s and counteracting 
to their rituals, and countermanding their procedures." Thus Rama spoke to Khara irefully. 
While Raghava is speaking that way with such an impetuosity in that forest, Khara started to intimidate 
him rancorously in a voice stridulous than braying. 
"Priding yourself resolutely you are unfearing even in a fearful situation, thereby you have indeed 
gone into the control of death, and for sure you are unmindful of what is speakable and what is not." 
Thus, Khara started his tongue-lashing. 
"Such of those men on whom the Lead of the Time verily closes in, they will not know what is to be done 
and what not, for all of their six senses will be rendered insensible." Thus Khara intimidated Rama. 

Saying so to Rama that nightwalker Khara then knitting his brows tightly saw everywhere for an assault 
weapon for use in that combat, and then he indeed found one not far away from him, namely a huge saala 
tree. 
He curled his lips in frown and started to extricate that Saala tree, and that great-mighty Khara on 
forcefully uprooting that tree with both of hands hurled it aiming at Rama, braying loudly and shouting 
at him 'you are dead...' 
But that adventurous Rama on shredding that tree which is swooping down with a torrent of arrows, and 
deciding to eliminate that Khara in that war evoked an unusual rancour, which rancour is equally an 
unusual facet of Rama. 
Rama whose body is perspiring and whose eyes are acrimoniously bloodshot at ends, he utterly shredded 
Khara with a thousand arrows in that war. 
Copious frothy blood gushed out from the gashes of arrows on the mountainous body of Khara, like the 
rapids on Mt. Prasavana, and it overflowed on earth too. 
When Khara is tormented with the arrows of Rama in that conflict he is bedevilled and with his blood 
stinking body he quickly bolted towards that Rama alone. 
When Khara is descending on boisterously with his body bathed in blood, that adept one in the Science 
of Archery,dhanur veda, the scripture on archery, and that valorous Rama, 
in swiftness lurched a little...say, two or three steps... 
Then, Rama snatched an arrow which is similar to the Ritual-fire, and secondary only to the ultimate 
missile, namely the Brahma-missile, for the elimination of Khara in war. 
That particular arrow is made available to Rama through Sage Agastya by the king of gods, namely Indra, 
because Indra is a sensible one about the future course of events, and he is also prosperous in securing 
impossible weaponry, and now Rama fitted such an arrow on his bow and released it towards Khara. 
That formidable arrow is promptly released on Rama's stretching the bowstring up to his ear, bending 
bow almost to a circularity, and which arrow is thunderous while in egress like the thunder of a thunderbolt, 
and that has come and plunged inthe chest of Khara. 
Khara fell down on to earth and on being burnt by the radiation of that arrow he is like demon Andhaka, 
who once was very completely burnt by Rudra in Shveta-araNya, the White-forest. 
As with fall of demon Vritta or fall of demon Bala who are eliminated by Indra with his Thunderbolt, 
or as with the collapse of demon Namuchi who is eliminated by the same Indra just with forth or foam, 
Khara too is brought down. 
In this meantime gods gathering along with carana-s drummed celestial drums from all over and showered 
flowers on Rama from all over. 
And those gods and other celestials in their amazement said among themselves that 'in one and half hours, 
say seventy two minutes of this extreme crack-down Rama with his sharp arrows has eradicated fourteen 
thousand guise changing demons, including their chieftains Khara and Duushana. 
"Aha! Surprising is this great deed of Rama, the shrewd-soul, what a valour, what a fortitude, really, 
his valour and fortitude are like those of Vishnu..." Thus saying that way all of those gods have gone 
away as the have come. 
All the kingly-sages and elite-sages along with Sage Agastya, who as incidentally came here to witness 
the victory of Rama, then on foregathering near at Rama delightedly said this on adoring him. 
"He that great-resplendent one, the controller of demon Paka, and the destroyer of enemy's cities, namely 
Indra, once came to the meritorious hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga only for the purpose such an elimination 
of demons. 
"For the purpose of eradicating these demons who are the evildoers by nature and the natural enemies 
to saintly people you are led to this countryside by the great sages with an ideation. 
"That which is the task of ours it is accomplished by you, oh, son of Dasharatha, now that Dandaka is 
unimpeded these great-sages will be practising their respective sacred devoirs in it." Thus, the sages 
expressed their thanksgiving. 
In the meanwhile the brave Lakshmana exiting from the mountain cave came along with Seetha to their 
hermitage, and he is charmed at the victory of his brother Rama. 
And then that brave and victories Rama too came towards hermitage while great-sages reverenced him, 
and he entered the hermitage while Lakshmana came forward to greet him. 
And Seetha on seeing her husband, the eliminator of enemies and accorder of happiness to sages, embraced 
her husband Rama, rejoicingly. 
Janaka's daughter Seetha on seeing the hordes of demons eliminated, and even on observing her husband 
is also scatheless, she is all-smiles for him smiling sniggeringly. 
She whose face is beaming with delight that Seetha, the daughter Janaka, on seeing Rama who has eliminated 
demonic troops, and whom great-sages are worshipping, again embraced him and became rapturous. But when Khara is about to lunge to the forefront of Rama, nearing him the commander of demonic forces 
named Trishira spoke this to him. 
"Desisting from your personal adventure you enjoin me for I am an invader, and then you are certain 
to see me felling that mighty-armed Rama in combat. 
"Taking oath on my weapon I promise to you that I truly wish to kill this Rama, as he deserves ill of 
all the demons by killing. 
"Hold back your combative-adventurism and become an examiner to decide whether I am going to become 
his god of death in this combat, or he becomes mine. 
"If I were to kill Rama you may gladly proceed to Janasthaana, else if Rama kills me then you can adventurously 
proceed against him for a combat." Thus Trishira spoke to Khara. 
By that death-greedy demon Trishira, Khara is manoeuvred and Khara to him said 'begone... combat...' 
and thus permitted, Trishira proceeded to the forefront of Rama. 
Trishira with a lustrous chariot that is yoked with equally lustrous horses hurried towards Rama in 
that war, like a tri-peaked mountain, for they say, he is a tri-headed demon. 
Discharging hosts of arrow-torrents like a hefty-arrow-cloud, he readily discharged a noise similar 
to the thudding drumbeat when a water-wet war-drum is beaten, rather than a blast from a heated drum. 

On seeing the oncoming of that demon Trishira, Raghava welcomed him by speedily winnowing smarting arrows 
from his bow. 
That grave and tumultuous encounter chanced between Rama and Trishira is like the extremely forceful 
encounter between a loin and an elephant. 
Later when Trishira smote on the forehead of highly enraged Rama with three arrows, Rama's ire is intensified 
and he franticly said this to that demon. 
"Oho! What an energy of a triumphing adventurer is this! A demon with this sort of energy is adventuring 
me, whose arrows rap my forehead peripherally, like flowers! 
"Now you accept arrows plunging from the string of my bow..." saying thus, that infuriated Rama with 
his alacritous swiftness hit the chest of Trishira with fourteen arrows similar to venomous snakes. 

With four of his straight shooting arrows that have hook-like barbs, that resplendent Rama hewed down 
four of the speedy horses of Trishira's chariot. 
With eight arrows Rama felled the charioteer from his settle on the chariot, and with one arrow ripped 
off the high flying flag on that chariot. 
When that nightwalker is vaulting from that smashed chariot Rama with his arrows tore his chest to shreds 
and he that Trishira became inert. 
And with three sharp and rapid arrows, and even with his own exasperation, Rama of inestimable aptitude 
rolled the three heads that demon. 
When that nightwalker is highly tortured with Rama's arrows he collapsed spewing blood with fumes, whereat 
he is standing in war, at where his three heads rolled just now. 
As with the fleeing of deer alarmed by a tiger, the demons remaining after liquidation, whom Khara has 
protected so far and whose confidence is now shattered, are running away, and they gave Khara the run-around. 

On seeing at those deserters Khara is piqued and quickly brought them back to his control, and then 
as with the scampering of eclipsing planet Rahu towards moon during lunar-eclipse, he scurried towards 
Rama alone. Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are 
			in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved 
			over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are 
			the ultimate in Vedic culture.
Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama's exile is inaaryavarta, the place of noblemen, 
			from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area calledjanasthana,meaning 
			people's place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic 
			individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though 
			people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as 
			per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their 
			own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals.
The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of 
			Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, "The finding allows us for the first 
			time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals." It is not clear from 
			the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even 
			at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which 
			had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence 
			indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, 
			and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about  years ago. This practice is attributed to some 
			underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in 
			Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But 
			the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for 
			their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported 
			to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but 
			a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing 
			towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests.
When it comes toisms, it is said that the whole clash is betweenVaishnavaitesandShaivitesorShaaktaites, because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism 
			is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons  portrayed 
			hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity 
			of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything 
			that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down 
			by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama's war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will 
			be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity 
			that goes against any civility.
Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, 
			and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient 
			commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence 
			much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically 
			and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what 
			we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected 
			by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It 
			may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, 
			the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create 
			havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, 
			with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra.
On entering the impenetrable Dandaka forest that courageous and unassailable Rama saw a clusters of hermitages of sages. 

Overspread with Darbha, the sacred grass, and jute clothing, well pervaded with Vedic splendour and well glowing like the 
un-seeable solar arena in the sky, with naked eye. 
On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking "Oh! Pooshan! God Sun, nourisher of the universe, the trueness of 
the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like vessel,  slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous 
devotee, I visualize 
Those hermitages have well-tidied thresholds on all sides, dense with many deer and teemed with many groups of birds, and 
they are the recourse for all living beings. 
Those hermitages are always adored by groups of apsarasa-s with their continued dancing, their Holy Fireplaces are very 
broad, and are with oblation items, vessels, deerskins and sacred grass, and they are beaming forth with gigantic trees 
that yield sacred and palatable fruits, and with ritual fuels, and water vessels, tubers and fruits. 
Those hermitages are sacrosanct for Ritual fire is being worshiped with fire-oblations and sacrifices to the reverberating 
Vedic sounds, and they are enwrapped with lotus ponds with lotuses, and even with flowers of forest. 
They have age-old saints with controlled senses who are clad in jute cloths and deerskin, and who subsist on fruits and 
tubers alone, ye their resplendence is like that that of the Sun-god or the Fire-god. 
Rama has seen such a cluster of hermitages that is glistening forth just by the presence of holy saints whose sustenance 
is constrained, and that hermitage is distinctive like Brahma's abode, reverberating with the sounds of that Brahma's Vedic 
chants alone. 
That glorious and great resplendent Rama on seeing those precincts of hermitage that is graced with highly blest Brahmans, 
the knowers of Brahma, neared it, unstringing the bowstring of his great bow. 
Those great sages, the possessors of divine knowledge, are gladdened on seeing Rama and illustrious Seetha, and they moved 
towards them welcomingly. 
But those sages who are austerely committed to vows, on their seeing Rama, the treader on the path of rectitude, and who 
is now arising like moon, and at Lakshmana and at glorious Seetha as well, rendered Vedic blessings and welcomed the trio. 

Those forest-dwelling sages saw the physical built, its augustness and gracefulness, and his fine attire remaining in astonished 
postures. 
The forest-dwellers saw Seetha, Lakshmana and Rama, without a wink on their own eyes, as that trio is causing surprise with 
their arrival.
The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes  as their arrival is causing surprise.
The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes 
Those august sages that are interested in the well being of all beings have indeed accommodated Rama in that hermitage, 
as Rama is their guest a priori. 
Then those august sages who are similar to sacred fire in glow have procedurally accorded guestship to Rama, and fetched 
water for him. 
On sounding out Vedic blessings those virtuous sages have offered flowers, fruits and tubers, and even the entire hermitage 
to that great soul Rama, and then with their palms adjoined. 
"The king will have great renown for he is the ruler of the righteousness of these people, a protector, a respectable and 
adorable one, and as he wields the sceptre of justice, he is a revered one too... 
"The fourth part of Indra is the protector of people, called the king, and hence Oh! Raghava, the king is hailed, and hence 
he enjoys best and delightful fortune... 
"You alone have to protect us as we are the subjects living in your kingdom..May you be in the capital... or in the forest...you 
are our king... 
"We gave-up punishments, either physically or by the power of curses, conquered are our anger and senses, and our ascesis 
is the only wealth of ours, thus oh! King, we are to be protected by you, like the foetus inside a womb... 
Thus saying they worshipped Raghava along with Lakshmana, on giving fruits, tubers, flowers and other varieties of forest 
foods. 
Thus other saints and sages who are the followers of the virtue, and similar to the Sacred Fire adored Rama, the king, according 
to the wont of custom. On entering the hermitage Lakshmana, the younger brother of Raghava, reached Agastya's disciple and 
spoke this sentence to him. 
"A king named Dasharatha was there, his eldest son and the dynamic one, Rama has arrived along with 
his wife Seetha to see the sage. 
"I am his loyal, dedicated, and adherent younger brother named Lakshmana, if ever you have heard of 
us. 
"Such as we are, we entered the awful forest at the decree of our father, and we wiush to see the godly 
sage, let this be informed to him." Said Lakshmana to the disciple of Agastya. 
On hearing that sentence of Lakshmana that disciple who is ascetically rich replied 'agreed, ' and he 
entered the sanctum of Ritual-fire to submit the same to Agastya. 
He that agreeable disciple of sage quickly approached the irrefutable sage by his asceticism, made palm-fold 
and said this to the eminent sage about about the arrival of Rama, exactly as said by Lakshmana. 
"Sons of King Dasharatha, Rama and also thus Lakshmana have entered the threshold of hermitage along 
with the wife of Rama, namely Seetha. 
"Those two enemy-destroyers have come cherishing to see and serve you, hence it will be apt of you to 
order what next is to be done in this regard." Said disciple to the sage. 
Having heard from the disciple that Rama has arrived with Lakshmana and with highly fortunate Seetha 
the sage said this to him. 
"My heart is indeed yearning for his arrival, and after this long a time Rama providentially came to 
see me." 
"Go forth and make welcome to Rama, Lakshmana and to Seetha, and they be entered here, why you have 
not invited them as yet? 
Thus said by the great-souled sage and the knower of virtue, the disciple adored him with palm-fold 
saying that "as you say." 
Then that disciple went out with a little perplexity and said this to Lakshmana, "Where is this Rama? 
He may come to see the sage and let him enter hermitage on his own." Said that disciple to Lakshmana. 

Then on going out to the exterior of that hermitage along with that disciple, Lakshmana has shown him 
Rama and Janaka's daughter Seetha. 
While that disciple repeated the obliging words of Agastya entered that reception-worthy Rama into hermitage 
on receiving him well. 
And then Rama entered the hermitage with Seetha and Lakshmana looking over it which is overspread with 
docile deer. 
Rama entered inside the hermitage and saw therein the sanctus of Brahma, Fire-god, Vishnu, Indra, Vivasvat 
- the Sun-god, Soma - the Moon-god, Bhaga - one among the twelve Suns, and the sanctusms of Kubera, 

Then encircled by disciples the sage Agastya came out quickly, and Rama saw him who is glowing brilliant 
before all the other sages. 
On seeing the brilliantly glowing sage among those sages, he that bold Rama said this sentence to Lakshmana, 
the fortifier of fortune, "Here comes the godly sage, Lakshmana, by his eminence I comprehend him as 
a depository of all ascesis." 
That dexterous Rama on saying about that sun-like radiant sage Agastya, he that descendent of Raghu 
fell on the feet of Agastya touching them reverentially. 
Then he who is a delight to the on lookers that noble-hearted Rama on revering the sage along with Lakshmana 
and Seetha, the princess from Videha, stood aside with his palms adjoined. 
Offering seat and water that sage received Rama, and even on exchanging pleasantries that sage said 
to him, "please be seated." 
Having completed his personal worship to Fire-god, and having offered water and other formalities to 
guest, that sage gave viands to guests according to his hermitic observances. 
Then that eminent and shrewd sage Agastya in righteousness took his seat at the outset, and spoke to 
prudent Rama of righteousness itself, and who by now is sitting with his palms adjoined. 
"Worshipping the fire, giving water and worshipping the guest a hermit should receive a guest and feed 
him, and if a hermit practices contrarily, oh, Rama, he is destined to eat his own flesh like a false 
deponent in other world say, hell. 
"You are the king of all the world, the treader in the path of righteousness, great charioteer of probity, 
and you are the venerable and estimable one, and you have arrived as my dear guest. 
Saying thus, Agastya adored Raghava well with fruits, tubers, flowers and others according to his ardency, 
and then he said this to Rama. 
"This sacred bow that is decorated with gold and diamonds is crafted by the divine architect Vishvakarma 
pertains to Vishnu, and these unwasteful arrows equalling sun in their blaze are the gift of Brahma. 

"Also these two inexhaustible quivers packed with arrows that have the blaze of Ritual-fire, and this 
sword decorated in gold together with its sheath made up of excellent golden are once given to me by 
Indra. 
"By this bow, oh, Rama, once Vishnu eliminated horrible demons in war and brought back radiant prosperity 
to the celestials. 
"The bow, these two quivers, arrows, and the sword, oh, Rama, the endower of grace, receive and wield 
them to triumph over the demons as Indra would wield Thunderbolt. 
On saying thus that great resplendent and godly sage Agastya, gave all of those best weapons to Rama, 
and again spoke to Rama The misters for the great soul from Ikshvaku kings of Emperor Dasharatha, are 
			epitomised ones of their tactfulness, adroitness and are always obliged to undertake 
			welfare activities of their king and the kingdom. 
Eight ministers are there for that valiant and glorious King Dasharatha, who are 
			clean at heart and are involved in the works of the king and kingdom at all time. 
			
Dhristi, Jayantha, Vijaya, Suraashtra, Raashtravardhana, Akopa, Dharmapaala, are 
			seven, and Sumantra is the eighth one. 
Two venerable saints of eminence are religious ministers for they are authorities 
			in Vedic rituals, namely Vashishta and Vamadeva, who are the acquiescent with 
			religious matters, and apart from these two some more religious ministers are 
			also there to King Dasharatha. 
Suyajna, Jabaali, Kaashyapa, Gautama, Maarkandeya, Deerghaayu, and then Kaatyayana 
			are the scholarly Brahmans acting as religious ministers, and along with them 
			there are also Brahma-sages who are always the ancestral ritual scholars for Dasharatha's 
			family. 
All the ministers are well versed in scriptures, they shun bad deeds, skilful 
			ones in their duties with their senses regulated. Those great souls are affluent, 
			knowers of all sciences, firmly courageous, and they are distinguished and quiet-souls, 
			and those ministers are true to their word. They are magnificent, patient and 
			famed ones and they smile afore they converse. 
They never speak untruthful words in anger or in greed or for monetary reasons 
			either. There is nothing unknown to them, even a little, in their own country 
			or in the others either, or about everything that is happening or has happened, 
			or that is going to happen, for they know them through agents. 
They are efficient in administration and their friendships are well examined by 
			the king, and those ministers impose punishment even on their own sons, if situation 
			demands it. 
In collections to their treasury and to militarise their armies they are dutiful, 
			even an unfriendly person will not be tortured, if he were not really blameworthy. 
			
They are valiant ones with engineered enthusiasm, administrators of political 
			science, clean persons and protectors of subjects of their kingdom at all times. 
			
They do not persecute Brahman-s and Kshatriya-s to fill-up the treasury, and high 
			degree punishments will be given on assessing that person's, or the offender's 
			strength and weakness. 
All of those ministers are clean administrators of kingdom, and are in league 
			with each other, as such there is none anywhere, either in capital or in country, 
			a liar. 
None with an evil-mind or with an interest in other man's wife is there, and thus 
			on whole in the kingdom and also like that in the capital, there is an undisturbed 
			society. 
Well-dressed and well-decorated and they the ministers of King Dasharatha, observe 
			decency in the interest of the king and also of the kingdom, with diligence and 
			with a truthful-eye. 
They acquired good qualities from their mentors and they are renowned by their 
			expertise, and even in foreign countries they are famous for their intellectual 
			determinations in all affairs. 
Versatile and virtuous are they the ministers and there is none who discarded 
			his virtuosity, and they are the determiners of truce or war, and by their nature 
			they possess opulence. 
They are capable to keep up the confidentialities of strategies, and also capable 
			to apply their mind even in micro-affairs, and they know moral science comprehensively, 
			and above all, they are gentle articulators. 
Accompanied with such of those effectual and good-natured ministers the exalted 
			king Dasharatha ruled the earth. 
He that most generous one among men, Dasharatha, while observing through spies, 
			and to protect people righteously, and to give a good governance to them, he forsook 
			unrighteousness and became a generous king avowed to truthfulness alone, and thus 
			he that Dasharatha ruled the earth, which rulership is renowned in all the three 
			worlds. 
Emperor Dasharatha has not encountered either a superior or an equal in his kingship, 
			and to him there are many friends, subdued are his provincial kings and eliminated 
			is thorniness by his own valour. He thus ruled the world like Indra would in Heaven. 
			
In the company of those ministers, who are conducive to the strategies, interested 
			in the king and subjects as well, skilful and efficient ones, he that King Dasharatha 
			obtained brilliance, like the rising Sun along with resplendent sunrays. Rama spoke to Lakshmana while residing on the mountainside of Mt. Malayavata, also known as Mt. Prasavana, resulting in the elimination of Vali and the enthronement of Sugreeva.

"This is that time of which we thought and it has come to pass. Now it is the rainy season. You see the sky fully covered with mountainous clouds.

"Sustaining a nine-month pregnancy, impregnated through the Sun with his sunrays guzzling the essence of oceans, the heaven is giving birth to the elixir of life.

"It is very likely to climb up the flight of stairs of clouds to bedeck the sun with the garlands of white wild-jasmines, and red Arjuna flowers, in these days.

"Those clouds with pure white edges, and with the reddish hue of sunset extending on them, look like soft pieces of cloth bandaged on the gashes of the sky.

"Slothful breezes as she sighs, sunset tingeing her as sandal paste, the sky with blanched clouds on her face appears like the one sighing for love.

"Overly agonized with the searing summer, but thoroughly wetted with new waters, this earth looks like Seetha, both implacably outpouring tears.

"Freed from the wombs of clouds, cool as the leaves of minty-camphor, perfumed with the fragrance of Mogra plants, such as these breezes are it is possible to have a draught of them with the bowl of palms.

"This mountain with fully bloomed Arjuna flowers, further fragranced by Ketaka flowers is being anointed with downpours on a par with Sugreeva, who is anointed when his enemy is silenced.

"Donning clouds as black deer skins, torrents as sacred threads, and caves replete with breezes as vocals, the mountains look like young scholars reciting Veda-s.

"While the flashes of lightning are whipping the sky as if they are the golden whips, it is letting out the rattle of thunders holding out against its only throes.

"That lightning hingeing on the blue cloud is squirmy, to me it appears like woeful Vaidehi squirming in the grasp of Ravana.

"For those who are with their beloveds, these precincts are advantageous, as their directions, as to which east and which is west, are unclear; and to loverless ones like me, they are disadvantageous, because the same precincts have their planets and even their moon lost, and they look as though begrimed with dark-clouds.

"Feeling happy with the arrival of rain wild jasmine plants standing somewhere on the terraces of the mountain are flowered, and they are thickly covered with droplets of vapor as if they are the tears of happiness hovering round the flower-like faces of ladyloves at the arrival of their lovers, and such plants are becoming inciters of passion in me, who am let down by my sorrow for my ladylove.

"In these days the dust is quietened, the breeze is chilly, vile pervasions of summer are also quietened, conquests of kings indeed came to a halt, and the people in outstation are returning to their own countries.

"Presently swans have started journey to Lake Manasa eager to live there, but the Cakravaka birds, ruddy gees, that are together with their beloveds are not departing, and vehicles are not taking to the road as the rainwater has battered the roadways oftentimes.

"Widely bestrewn with clouds the sky is bright somewhere, and not so bright somewhere else, thus it is gleaming well with an aspect of the vast but tideless ocean that is by far dammed up with cloudlike mountains.

"Coalesced with Sarja and Wild-jasmine flowers, and also with the coppery ores of the mountain, the new waters are swiftly transiting towards the ocean, while screams of peacocks haunt them.

"The fruits of rose-apple that resemble honeybees are delightedly devoured as they are highly luscious, but the mango fruits that are discoloured and putrefied are falling to the ground heaved down by the wind.

"Electric charges as their fluttering flags of war, flights of cranes as their garlands of gallantry, those clouds very similar in their build to the pinnacles of lordly mountains are thundering with very high pitched voices like invigorated lordly elephants standing up to a fight.

"When clouds have completely rained on the greenery pasturelands are satiated with rainwater and peacocks are stimulated to dancing carnivals, thus it is extremely splendorous in afternoons, behold it.

"Clouds adorned with cranes around them are rumbling to transport them, and the weighty water contained inside their wombs, and reposing on the loftiest mountain peaks they are moving, moving and again reposing, like pregnant women.

"Highly delighted cranes are flying all over in rows highly desirous of the clouds, and they are shining forth like the best and lovely festoons of white lotus flowers as if the wind has upheaved and dangled them on the sky.

"The meadowland is with its new meadows which are medially dappled with young and small red-beetles, and it is shining forth as if she is a woman wearing a parrot-green wraparound on which lac-red spots are embroidered.

"These days sleep is slowly getting closer to Vishnu, rivers are rapidly getting closer to oceans, cranes are gleefully getting closer to clouds, and women are passionately getting closer to their beloveds.

"Interiors of forests have become adaptive for the peacocks to dance very well, Kadamba trees have become adaptive to their branches and bouquets, bulls with matching sensualities became adaptive to cows, and adaptive is this earth with its enrapturing crops and orchards, and all are adaptive to the season's gaiety.

"Rivers are surging, clouds are showering, rutty elephants are shrilling, forest interiors are shining, loverless are speculating, and peacocks are rocking, monkeys are resolving to stay at one place, for this is the rainy season.

"On whiffing the fragrance of new Ketaka flowers the lordly elephants are highly joyous and became excited, but they are baffled at the sounds made by the fall of water in the streamlets of forest, and those best ruttish elephants are blaring along with screaming peacocks.

"Honeybees languishing on the branches of Kadamba trees are knocked down by the downpour of rain, thereby they are slowly forfeiting the intemperance which they acquired in a trice by plunging themselves into the nectar of flowers.

"Rose-apple trees contain abundant fruits with profuse juice which look like the globated coal powder, with them the branches of those trees shine forth as though swilled by hives of honeybees.

"Ornamented with the flags of lightning, and that have whooping, profound, and blaring booms, those clouds by their appearances are verily shining forth like the elephants enthusiastic for war.

"That energetic and lordly elephant which readily started going towards the forest minding the track of that mountain, heard the thundering of the cloud, and doubting it a the war-whoop of another elephant took a right about turn wishingAt the screaming sound of birds and the sound of the crash of falling trees, all the 
inhabitants of Lanka then became trembled with fear.
Made to run to-and-fro and getting frightened, beasts and birds began to scream. Atrocious 
omens made their appearance before the demons.
Then, the ugly-faced female-demons, whose sleep has vanished, found that grove demolished 
and saw that great heroic monkey.
Seeing those female demons, the mighty-armed Hanuma endowed with great courage and 
might, assumed a gigantic form that created terror for the female demons.
Beholding that mighty monkey having a gigantic body similar to a mountain, the female demons 
then asked Seetha (as follows):
"Who is he? Whose messenger is he? From where and for what purpose he has come here? 
Wherefore a conversation was held by him with you?"
"O large-eyed Seetha! Tell us. Let there be no fear for you, O fortunate lady! What did 
he say to you? O lady having black outer eye corners!"
Thereupon Seetha the virtuous lady, having a complete beauty of all limbs, spoke as follows: 
"Where is the ability for me to know about the demons of a terrific form?"
"You alone can recognize who he is and what he does. A serpent only can recognize the 
feet of another serpent. There is no doubt about it."
"By seeing him, I too get frightened. I do not know who he is. I only know him as a demon, 
able to assume any form at his will, who arrived here."
Hearing the words of Seetha some female demons fled in different directions. Some stayed 
back. Some others went to Ravana to inform them about the matter.
After approaching Ravana, the female demons of ugly faces started to tell (as follows) 
of the monstrous and terrific monkey.
"O king! A monkey having a terrific body and boundless prowess, is stationed in the 
middle of Ashoka grove and made a conversation with Seetha."
"Even though questioned in many ways by us, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, having eyes 
similar to those of a doe, is not inclined to tell about the monkey."
"He may be a messenger of Indra the Lord of celestials, or the messenger of Kubera the 
king of riches or even a messenger sent by Rama to search for Seetha."
"He, having a wonderful form, has wiped off your grove, attached to the gynaecium, which 
is fascinating and extending with many kinds of animal flock."
"There is no place whatsoever in that grove, which was not destroyed by him. Only that 
place, where Seetha the daughter of Janaka was sitting, was not destroyed by him."
"It is not known whether to protect Seetha or because of fatigue, he has left that place 
undestroyed, or else, what fatigue is there for him? He has done it to protect Seetha."
"That well-grown Simsupa tree, abounding in charming sprouts and flowers, under which 
Seetha herself took shelter, and has been spared by him."
To that looking monkey by whom Seetha was spoken to and that grove destroyed you to order a terrible punishment.
"O chief of the demons-troops! Who would dare to talk to Seetha, who has been mentally 
accepted by you, except perhaps he who is ready to abandon his life?"
Hearing the words of the female demons, Ravana the lord of demons flared up like a funeral 
fire, his eyes spinning with anger.
Tears dropped from Ravana's enraged eyes, like drops of oil dripping from resplendent 
lamps.
Ravana, with great splendor, sent demons with a valiance equal to him, called Kinkaras, 
to catch hold of Hanuma.
He ordered eighty thousand of those Kinkaras who were strong. All those mighty Kinkaras 
with their large bellies, long tusks, and terrible forms, longing to fight with iron mallets and clubs 
in hand, in eagerness to lay hold on Hanuma, started from that place.
Approaching Hanuma who was standing near the arched doorway, they rushed toward him 
with a great speed, like locusts rushing towards a fire.
They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold, and arrows 
shining like the sun.
Quickly surrounding Hanuma with clubs, sharp-edged spears, iron pikes, lances, javelins 
and swords, they stood in front of him.
The highly splendorous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his 
tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise.
The highly splendorous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his 
tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise.
With that great sound made by Hanuma through clapping his arms together with a resound, 
birds fell from the sky. Hanuma also then cried aloud with a clamorous voice (as follows):
"Long live the mighty Rama and the powerful Lakshmana! Long live the King Sugreeva, protected 
by Rama!"
"I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am 
the servant of Rama, the king of Kosala Kingdom, who is unwearied in action."
"Even a thousand of Ravanas will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking 
with thousands of rocks and trees in battle."
"Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka, and after 
offering salutation to Seetha, I will go back after fully completing my task."
Those demons became frightened by the clamorous voice of Hanuma cried aloud and saw him 
to be as high as a twilight rain cloud.
Not feeling apprehended because of the orders of their king, those demons thereafter 
rushed towards Hanuma, with their terrific weapons.
Surrounded by those strong demons, Hanuma endowed with great strength 
seized a huge iron bar belonging to the arched gate.
Taking that iron rod, Hanuma killed the demons. That violent Hanuma strolled in the sky, 
taking that iron rod in his hand, as Garuda the eagle would carrying a serpent in its claws.
Killing the valiant demons called Kinkaras, that heroic Hanuma wishing to fight again, 
arrived at the archy gateway.
Some demons, who somehow escaped from that terror, went to Ravana and informed him that 
all the Kinkaras have been killed.
Hearing of a large army of demons having been killed, Ravana with his eyes rolling 
rapidly (with anger), ordered Jambumali, son of Prahasta, who was unequal in prowess and admirably unconquerable 
in battle.On the wish of King Dasaratha, Vasishta goes to Rama's palace and asks him to perform fast that night along with Seetha. Vasishta returns to Dasaratha's palace and informs him about this. On the way to the king's palace Vasishta observes the festive atmosphere in Ayodhya anticipating Rama's coronation the next day.
After Rama left, king Dasaratha called for his family priest Vasishta and spoke to him as follows about the ensuing anointment ceremony of the next day.
"O, great sage Vasishta! Please go to the avowed Rama and Seetha today to make them perform fasting for obtaining prosperity, glory and sovereignty."
Vasista, who is the best of knowers of Veda, who is expert in mantras, who is firm in austerities and who is divine, said to Dasaratha : "I agree to it" and personally went to Rama's house on a chariot which was ready and quite suitable for a Brahman; so as to advise Rama to undertake a fast (with mantras) performed by Rama, a knower of mantras.
That great sage reached Rama's house, which was radiant like a dense white cloud and entered the three gateways of the house by the chariot itself.
To respect the honorable sage, who arrived, Rama came quickly and hurriedly out of the house.
Rama quickly got nearer to Vasishta's chariot and personally helped him to alight
from the chariot.
That family priest Vasishta seeing that lovable and humble Rama, spoke the following words, bringing cheerfulness and happiness to him:
"O, Rama! Your father is delighted with you. You will be getting the princely
kingdom. Hence, you and Seetha perform fasting today."
"Your father; King Dasaratha is anointing you affectionately for the princely
kingdom tomorrow at dawn; even as king Nahusha has done to Yayati".
Vasistha thus spoke to Rama and enjoined him to undertake a vow of fasting together with Seetha, in the accompaniment of mantras.
Thereafter, Rama worshipped the royal priest Vasistha suitably. Vasistha then got
Rama's permission and left his house.
Rama spent some time by delightedly talking with friends and having been  congratulated by them in various ways went into his palace after taking leave of them.
Then, Rama's house was shining, as brilliantly with delighted men and women, as a
lake filled with opened lotuses and visited by innumerable happy birds.
Vasishta, leaving Rama's house, which seemed like the royal palace, saw the way
filled with people.
All the royal highways in the city of Ayodhya were filled with groups and groups of delighted people and became congested.
Then, on the royal road, the resonance created by the rush of the people, moving
hither and thither like waves, combined with their rejoicing, resounded like the roar of an ocean.
On that day, in the city of Ayodhya, all the roads were cleaned and sprinkled with water. There were rows of trees on both sides of the roads and flags hoisted on houses.
Then, the people of Ayodhya including children, women and the old-aged were waiting for sunrise, wishing the anointment ceremony of Rama to happen.
In Ayodhya, people were enthusiastic to see the great public function, which was
decorative to the community and which would bring forward an increased joy.
Vasishta, thus seeing the king's way being overcrowded with people, reached the
royal palace slowly by forcing a passage through that crowd.
He walked up the royal palace, which was akin to the top of a mountain enclosed by a white cloud and met king Dasaratha in the manner Brihaspati met Devendra.
Seeing Vasistha had returned, King Dasaratha alighted from his throne and asked him with regard to his mission. Vasistha informed him that it was accomplished.
The members of assembly who were sitting along with the king till then, raised in
obeisance to Vasishta from their seats, following the example of the king.
King Dasaratha, after obtaining permission from Vasishta, left that assembly of men and entered his palace as a lion enters a mountain cave.
That palace with women in top dress and form was like the palace of Devendra. By the entering of King Dasaratha, the palace became more radiant, just as the moon radiates a beautiful sky with its stars.Thus said Rama in agony that monkey Sugreeva with his palms adjoined, and with tears rolling in their eyes and also voice trembling with tears said this to Rama.
"Unfamiliar is the residence, or capability, or courage, or lineage of that sinning demon from a sinister dynasty, in any wise...
"Truthfully I am promising you, oh, enemy destroyer, as to how you will get back Maithili therefore I strive to make an effort, let anguish be discarded...
"As to how you will satisfy yourself by killing Ravana along with his henchmen, and as to how you pride yourself thereby, I will make it happen in that way in no longer a time...
"Enough is this clinging on to despair, recollect your inherent courage, and it is unseemly for persons of your sort to have this kind of mental ineptness...
"Upon me too this yearning caused by the separation of wife has changed, but I did not despair this way, nor I have forsaken my courage...
"Though I am a primitive monkey I am not disheartened by the distancing of wife, why tell about a great soul like you who are well read and courageous...
"It is apt of you to control trickling tears with courage, and equally it is inapt of you to discard the courage and decency of self-controlled people...
"Either in a riddle, or in financial loss, or at the end of life, or in fear, a courageous one does not sink, but indeed introspects in his mind...
"Stupid is that man who always follows self-piteous sadness unable to control himself and he drowns down in that melancholy like an overweighing ship in waters...
"Adjoined are my palms in this way beseeching you in friendship, kindly bear up your self-esteem and you should not give any leeway to sadness...
"Those that delve deep into moroseness, to them there is no happiness, and their brilliance too dwindles, thus saddening is inapt on your part...
"One well-engulfed in sadness doubts even his life, oh, king of kings, leave off that sadness and just hold on to courage...
"I am telling a benefiting and friendly thought, but not instructing you, should you regard my friendship then your saddening is inapt..." [Thus said Sugreeva to Rama.]
Sweetly solaced thus Sugreeva Rama dabbed his face with the edge of the cloth, which was covered fully with tears.
Lord Rama steadied himself in his nature by the words of Sugreeva, and on embracing him Rama said this sentence to him.
"Sugreeva, a friendly obligation that which is to be done, a benefiting, befitting and a timely one too, is what you have performed with your friendly advice...
"Oh, friend, I steadied myself in my nature when implored by you... it is impossible to get this kind of friend, especially at these times...
"But, trying to search for Maithili and that furious, evil-minded demon Ravana, is your endeavour...
"What is to be done by me that be said in all believability, and all your endeavour will reap like the crops planted during the rainy season in good lands...
"What I speak that is in my self-confidence but not in any self-conceit, oh, tiger-monkey, deem them as doubtless facts...
"Untruth is not uttered by me earlier nor will be at any time from now, and all this I am promising you taking oath on that truthfulness alone.
Then on hearing the words of Rama Sugreeva along with his monkey ministers is gladdened, especially by Rama's promise.
Then those two, the man and the monkey, met in privacy and both discussed in a mutually befitting manner about their pleasures and pains.
On hearing the word of that intellectual, highly capable one and the best king among kings, namely Rama, Sugreeva, the chief among the monkey heroes, thought at heart that his manoeuvre to surpass his dominant brother Vali was accomplished.Meanwhile, Sugreeva the king of Monkeys, possessing a great splendour and a mighty
power, enquired saying, "Why is this army agitated, like a ship driven out of its course in
water?"
Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Angada the son of Vali replied, saying "Do you not
see the high-souled Rama and Lakshmana of the great chariot, those two valiant sons of Dasaratha
covered with darts lying all bloody in a bed of arrows?"
Thereupon, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeys said to his son Angada: "To my mind, there
is some othere cause why the monkeys are bewildereed. There must be some danger ahead."
"Here, these monkeys are runnng away in all directions, with their eyes distended
with terror, throwing down their arms and looking dejected."
"They are not ashamed of one another. They are not looking behind than even. They
are jostling each other and leaping over those who have fallen."
In the midst of this turmoil, the valiant Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his hand
came there and cheered Sugreeva and Rama saying "Victory to Rama! Victory to Rama!."
Observing Vibhishana to be the cause of panic among the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke to
the illustrious Jambavan the king of Bears who stood near (as follows):
"It is Vibhishana who has come here. On seeing him, the foremost of monkeys seized
with terror have fled, deeming him to be Indrajit, Ravana's son."
"You reassemble those monkeys immediately, who in fear have scattered in many
directions and inform them that it is Vibhishana who has come!"
Thus spoken by Sugreeva, Jambavan the king of Bears called the fugitive monkeys back
and restored them to confidence.
Hearing the words of Jambavan the king of Bears, all those monkeys, on perceiving
Vibhishana, retraced their steps, shaking off their fear.
Meanwhile, the virtuous Vibhishana, on beholding Rama's body as also of Lakshmana's
covered with arrows, felt distressed.
Washing their eyes with his hands dipped in water, Vibhishana began to weap, with
anguish seizing his heart and lamented, saying:
"These two powerful and valiant warrriors have been brought tot his state by the
demons, the treacherous combatants."
"The son of my brother, that wicked youth of perverse soul in his demoniac cunning
mind, has decived those two honourable fighters."
"These two warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, who were struck badly by arrows and covered
with blood are lying on the earth, like two porcupines."
"These two lions among men, on whom depended the positon aspired by me, are lying
insensible, waiting for the dissolution of the body."
"Deprived of the hope now of becoming a king, I am as one dead, eventhough
surviving; while my rival Ravana sees his vow fulfilled and gets his desires realised."
Then, Sugreeva the magnanimous King of Monkeys embraced that Vibhishana thus
lamenting and spoke the following words:
"O, knower of what is right! You shall certainly reign over Lanka. Ravana and his
son will not acheive their purpose."
"The injury done to Rama and Lakshmana is not grave. Emerging from their swoon, they
will destroy Ravana with his hordes in battles."
Consoling and convincing Vibhishana thus, Sugreeva spoke to Sushena, his
father-in-law, who was on his side (as follows):
"Taking these two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana with the troops of monkeys who are
strong, you go to Kishkindha, till these two scourgers of their foes have recovered their
consciousness."
"As for me, I shall slay Ravana with his son and his relatives and bring back Seetha
as did Indra the Lord of celestials, the prosperity he had lost."
"Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Sushena replied as followers: " A highly terrific
and great was between celestials and demons was perceived by me."
"By making themselves invisible again and again, the demons skilled in the use of
arrows overcame the celestials despite their skill in bearing arms."
"To those celestials who were wounded, unconscious and almost deprived of life,
Brihaspati treated them by the aid of herbs accompanied by his spells of sacred formulas."
"Let the monkeys Sampati, Panasa and others go quickly in speed, to the ocean of
milk, to bring those herbs."
"These monkeys are conversant with those efficacious mountianous herbs - the
celestial Sanjivakarani and Vishalya, which were created by a God."
"In the bosom of the milky ocean the best of oceans, rise the mountains called
Chandra and Drona, where the ambrosia was formerly churned. These two excellent herbs exist
there."
"The celestials place dthose two mountain in the vast sea. O, King! Let Hanuman the
son of Wind-God go there."
In the meantime, a great wind arose, accompanied by massed clouds and lightning,
whipping up the salty waves in the ocean, causing the mountains to tremble as from an
earthquake.
"Large trees on the sand-banks had their branches broken by the mighty stroke of
Vata's wings and fell headlong into the briny waters of the ocean."
"The snakes became frightened. The snakes inhabiting there and all the marine
animals plunged quickly into the briny ocean."
Thereupon, all the monkeys saw within a moment, a mighty eagle, Garuda, the son of
Vinata, like unto a blazing torch.
On beholding Garuda the eagle which came there, the serpants who bound those two
warriors Rama and Lakshmana in the form of mighty arrows, fled away.
Thereupon, Garuda the eagle, coming into contact iwth Rama and Lakshmana d offering
them his good wishes, with his hands caressly touched their faces that were radiant like the
moon.
Their wounds, touched by Garuda the eagle, were healed. Their bodies soon became
smooth and well-rounded.
Their lustre, valour, strength, endurance and resolution, those great qualities,
also their perspicacity, intelligence and memory were re-doubled.
Lifting them up both who were like Indra, the highly majestic Garuda the eagle
embraced them. Rama also, being pleased, spoke to him (as follows):
"Now, by your grace, we both have overcome a great disaster created by Indrajit the
son of Ravana. We have been made strong as before."
"By meeting you thus, my heart is gladdened in the same manner as I am meeting
Dasaratha, my fatehr and Aja, my paternal grandfather."
"Who are you, the one endowed with beauty, having blissful garlands and anointments,
wearing clean garments and adorned iwth divine ornaments?"
The highly majestic and the mighty Garuda the eagle, the King of Birds, with his eys
widened in gladness and with a pleased heart, spoke to Rama as follows:
"O, Rama! I am your dearest friend Garuda dear as your own breath moving outside I
came here for the purpose of helping you, both."
"Either the most valiant demons or the exceedingly strong monkeys or the celestials
together with the celestial musicians having Devendra the Lord of celestials in their forefront are
unable to untie this awfully terrific entanglement of arrows created through his power of sorcery
by Indrajit of terrific deeds."
"These serpents, which took their base at, were none other than the sons of Kadru
with their sharp fangs, abundantly filled with poison, transformed into arrows, by the dint of
sorcery by Indrajit the demon."
"O, Rama the knower of righeousness and true to your promise! You, along with your
brother Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies, indeed are lucky."
"Hearing about this incident, I have hastened all at once, duly cherishing the love
and friendship (for you)."
"You have been released from this quite terrific shackle of arrows. Both of you
should maintain vigilance, all the time."
"All the demons by their very nature are treacherous fighters in battle. For you,
the warriors, your pue-mindedness and straight forwardeness are the strengths."
"What Indrajit has done, exemplifies how the demons are always crooked-minded. For
this reason, you should not trust the demons in battle."
That mighty Garuda, having spoken thus to Rama then and having affectionately
embraced him, began to take leave of him.
"O, Rama the knower of piety, affectionate even towards your enemies and my dear
fried! I wish to take leave of you." I shall proceed happily."
"O, hero! You need not be so curious to know the casue of my friendship. You will
know of it, once you have accomplished success in battle."
"When, under the flutter of your arrows, Lanka has been destroyed save for the aged
and the children and you have slain Ravana,. your enemy, you will bring back Seetha."
Having spoken thus, Garuda of swift flight, having beautiful wings, who had just
healed Rama's wounds in the presence of monkeys, having paid obeisance presence of monkeys, having
paid obeisance to him (by circumambulation) and taken him into his arms, entered the sky with the
speed of the wind.
Seeing Rama and Lakshmana healed of their wounds, the cheifs of monkeys haowled like
roars of lions and lashed their tails.
Thereupon, gongs were beaten, drums resounded, and couches were blown amid jumping
in joy of the monkeys as before.
Some other strong monkeys who use trees as maces in battle, waving their arms and
uprooting hundreds and thousands of various trees, stood there, ready for the battle.
Uttering great noises, frightning the demons and desirous to fight, the monkeys
reached the gates of Lanka.
Thereafter, a highly terrible and tumuluous sound arose among the leaders of the
monkeys, as, at the end of summer the roaring of thunder clouds in the mid-night.Hearing the cries of these who were thus wailing, the virtuous minded Rama then
became thoughtful for a while, afflicted as he was with melancholy, his eyes filled with tears.
Thereupon, Kubera the King of Yakshas, Yama the lord of death together with the
deceased ancestors, Indra the lord of celestials Varuna the lord of waters, the illustrious Shiva
the great deity who bears the device of a bull as his banner and having three eyes, Brahma the
creator of all the worlds and the best among the knowers of sacred knowledge all these together
reaching the City of Lanka in aerial cars, shining like the sun approached Rama.
Lifting their long arms, their hands decked with ornaments, those excellent gods
thereupon, spoke (as follows) to Rama who stood there, making a respectful salutation to them with
his folded hands.
"How do you, the maker of the entire cosmos, the foremost among those endowed with
knowledge and an all-capable person, ignore Seetha who is falling into the fire? How do you not
recognize yourself to be the foremost of the troop of gods?"
"Among the Vasus (a class of gods, eight in number), you are the Vasu, named
R^itadhama (one whose abode is Truth or the Divine Law) who was formerly the self-constituted
ruler, the first creator of all the three worlds and the lord of creatures."
"You are the eighth Rudra among (eleven) Rudras and the fifth (Viryavan by name)
among the Sadhyas (a particular class of celestials belonging to Gana Devata). The twin Aswinis are
your ears. The sun and the moon constitute your eyes."
"O the destroyer of the adversaries. You are seen (to exist) at the beginning and at
the end of creation. Yet, you ignore Seetha, just like a common man."
Hearing the words of those guardians of the world, Rama, the lord of creation, who
was born in Raghu dynasty and the foremost one among protectors of righteousness, spoke to those
god-chiefs as follows:
"I think of myself to be a human being, by name Rama, the son of Dasaratha. You, as
a gracious Divinity, tell me that which I as such really am like this."
Hearing the words of Rama, Brahma (the creator), the foremost among the knowers of
Brahma the Absolute, spoke as follows: "Listen to my true word, O the truly brave lord!"
"You are the Lord Narayana himself the glorious god, who wields the discus. You are
the Divine Boar with a single tusk, the conqueror of your past and future enemies."
"You are Brahma, the imperishable, the Truth abiding in the middle as well as at the
end of the universe. You are the supreme righteousness of people, whose powers go everywhere. You
are the four-armed."
"You are the wielder of a bow called Sarnga, the lord of the senses, the supreme
soul of the universe, the best of men, the invincible, the wielder of a sword named Nandaka, the
all-pervader, the bestower of happiness to the earth and endowed with great might."
"You are the leader of the army and the village headman. You are the intellect. You
are the endurance and the subduer of the senses. You are the origin and the dissolution of all,
Upendra the Divine Dwarf and (the younger brother of Indra) as also the destroyer Madhu, the
demon."
"You perform action for Indra the lord of celestials, the Supreme Ruler, the one
having a lotus in one's navel and who puts an end to all in battle. The divine sages pronounce you
to be fit to afford protection to all and the refuge for all."
"In the form of the Vedas, you are the great Bull with hundred heads (rules) and
thousand horns (precepts). You are the first creator of all, the three worlds, and the self
constituted Lord of all. You are the refuge and the forbear of Siddhas (a class of demi-gods
endowed with mystic powers by virtue of their very birth) and Sadhyas (a class of celestial
beings.)"
"You are the sacrificial performance. You are the sacred syllable 'Vashat' (on
hearing which the Adhvaryu priest casts the oblation to a deity into the sacrificial fire). You are
the mystic syllable 'OM'. You are higher than the highest. People neither know your end nor your
origin nor who you are in reality."
"You appear in all created beings in the cattle and in brahmanas. You exist in all
quarters, in the sky, in mountains and in rivers."
"With thousand feet, with hundred heads and with thousand eyes along with Lakshmi
the goddess of wealth, you bear the earth with all its created beings along with its
mountains."
"O Rama! You appear as Sesha, a large serpent in water, at the earth's bottom,
bearing the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas, the celestial musicians and the demons."
"O Rama! I (brahma) am your heart. Saraswathi, the goddess (of learning) is your
tongue. O lord! The gods created by Brahma are the hair on all your limbs."
"Night has been recognized as the closing of your eye-lids and the day, as the
opening of eye-lids. The correct usages of your words are the Vedas. Bereft of you, this visible
universe does not exist."
"The entire cosmos is your body. The earth constitutes your firmness. Fire is your
anger. The moon constitutes your placidity. You are Lord Vishnu (who bears the mark Srivatsa - a
curl of white hair on his breast)."
"In the past, the three worlds were occupied by you in your three strides, after
binding the exceptionally formidable Bali (the ruler of the three worlds) and Indra was made the
king (by you)."
"Seetha is no other than Goddess Lakshmi (the divine consort of Lord Vishnu), while
you are Lord Vishnu. You are having a shining dark-blue hue. You are the Lord of created beings.
For the destruction of Ravana, you entered a human body here, on this earth."
"O Rama, the foremost among the supporters of righteousness! The aforesaid purpose
of ours has been fulfilled. Ravana has been killed. Return to your divine abode, with a
rejoice."
"O Lord! Unerring is your valour. Your exploits are never in vain. O Rama! Your
blessed sight is powerful. The songs in praise of you never go in vain."
"Those humans who are full of devotion to you will never be unsuccessful on this
earth. Those who are devoted to you, the primeval and the eternal lord, belonging to ancient times
and the Supreme Person, will forever attain their desired objects here as well as hereafter."
"Humiliation will never be the plight of those humans who will recite this hymn in a
divine ancient history, sung by Brahma, the foremost seer."That night having given way to dawn, the illustrious Rama with a broad chest spoke (as follows) to Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra and who was endowed with auspicious signs : "Oh, dear brother! This is the hour of sunrise. The auspicious night has departed. That bird of dark plumage, the cuckoo, is singing."
"Oh, good brother! Hear the cries of peacocks resounding in the forest. Let us cross the swift-flowing Ganga River that gushes to the sea."
Lakshmana, the delight of his friends, having understood the words of Rama, called Guha as well as Sumantra and stood in front of his brother.
Hearing the command of Rama, Guha quickly received it, invited his ministers and
spoke to them as follows: "Let a beautiful boat that is solidly constructed, sails well and a helmsman in it, be brought to the bank to carry this hero across!"
Hearing that command, the chief minister of King Guha brought a charming boat to the bank and reported the matter to Guha.
Then, Guha with folded hands spoke to Rama as follows: "Oh, Lord! Here, the boat has arrived. What more can I do for you?"
"Oh, tiger among men! Oh, Rama resembling a son of divinity! Here is the boat for
you to cross the river, which flows into the sea. Oh, virtuous one! (Pray) get into it."
Then, Rama with great splendor, spoke to Guha as follows: "My desire has been
accomplished by you. Let us embark with all speed."
Having equipped themselves with a quiver each with arrows, fastening their swords
and armed with their bows, Rama and Lakshmana, with Sita, proceeded towards the river of Ganga.
Sumantra joining his palms in humility, approached Rama who knew what is right and said, "What shall I do?"
Touching Sumantra with his auspicious right hand, Rama then said: "Oh, Sumantra!
Return quickly to the king's presence and be attentive in serving him."
"Go now, that your service to me has been completed. Abandoning the chariot, I shall go on foot to the mighty forest," Rama said.
Finding himself dismissed, Sumantra the charioteer was distressed and spoke to Rama, the tiger among men, as follows:
"None in the world has had to suffer such a fate as yourself; that you should have to dwell in the forest with your brother and your consort as if you were an ordinary man!"
"I think that there is no reward in leading a life of religious student or in
studying religious scriptures or even in cultivating tenderness and straight forwardness, when adversity has come to you."
"Oh, heroic Rama! Living in the forest along with Sita and your brother, you will
obtain the same position as one who has conquered the three worlds."
"Oh, Rama! We are actually ruined, in that, disappointed in our hopes by you too, we shall fall under the sway of Kaikeyi the sinful woman and reap the suffering."
Sumantra the charioteer thus speaking, wept for a long time, stricken with grief,
seeing Rama, equal to his soul, departing to a distance.
Then, Rama again and again spoke these sweet words as follows to that charioteer,
whose tears got dried up and who had sipped some water and got himself purified:
"I do not see any one who is as great a friend of the Ikshvakus as you are. (Pray) act in such a way that king Dasaratha may not lament about me"
"The king, his mind afflicted with grief, is aged as well. He is pressed down by a burden of passion. Hence, I tell you this."
"What so ever act that high-soled emperor may enjoin you to do, with intent to
oblige the desire of Kaikeyi, it is to be done unhesitatingly."
"The kings indeed rule the states with this end in view that their will may not be frustrated in any undertaking."
"Oh, Sumantra! Carry out everything in such a way that the said emperor neither
finds it unpleasing nor gets tormented by grief."
"Only after performing respectful salutation to the old and venerable king, who has never known suffering and who has subdued his senses, you tell these words to him on my behalf."
"Indeed neither I nor Lakshmana and Sita grieve for having moved from Ayodhya or
that we are going to dwell in a forest."
"After completing fourteen years, you will once more see Lakshmana, myself and Sita too returned apace from the forest."
"Oh,Sumantra! This is what you should say to the king, my mother, all other queens and Kaikeyi. Tell Kausalya again and again that I am keeping good health. Thereafter, convey salutations at her feet on behalf of Sita as well as myself and Lakshmana the faithful man."
"Tell our salutations to the emperor too. Bring Bharata quickly. After his arrival, Bharata may be installed in the position, as desired by the king."
"When you embrace Bharata and install him in the office of the Prince Regent, the
agony caused by the repentance felt by you on our account will not overpower you."
"Bharata too is to be told thus: "Treat without distinction all your mothers with
the same regard as you behave towards the king."
"As is your affection for Kaikeyi, so let it be for Sumitra and also the divine
Kausalya, my mother"
"If you accept the princely kingdom with an intent to please our father, it will be possible for you to enhance happiness in both the worlds (in this world and the next)."
Sumantra, who was being sent back by Rama, was agonized with grief after hearing the whole of that discourse and affectionately spoke to Rama as follows:
"If I spoke to you fearlessly in a friendly tone without following courteousness,
you ought to forgive my mode of expression, considering me as your devotee"
"How indeed can I return without you to that city, which through separation from
you, has been reduced to the state of a mother stricken with grief due to separation from her son"
"By seeing my chariot on that day even with Rama in it, the people were lamenting so much. Now, if they see the chariot without Rama the city of Ayodhya will even be broken asunder."
"The city will be plunged in misery, like an army in which its commander is lost in a combat with the charioteer alone surviving, on seeing this chariot without you."
"Thinking of you, who though residing far away are established foremost in their
minds, the people of Ayodhya must have been deprived of their food today."
"The great perplexity that ensued, on the occasion of your exile, among the people (of Ayodhya), whose minds were depressed through grief on your account, was witnessed by you indeed, Oh, Rama!"
"The cry of distress raised by the citizens (of Ayodhya) will be increased a
hundred-fold, when they see me with an empty chariot."
"Further, shall I say to the queen Kausalya as follows: -  Your son, Rama has been taken by me to the house of his maternal uncle, do not grieve'."
"I cannot tell such words too which are untrue. How can I tell,  I abandoned your
son in the forest', which words are true but unkind?"
"How will the excellent horses obedient to me, which carried yourself, Sita and
Lakshmana, draw the chariot bereft of you?"
"Oh, the faultless Rama! For this reason, I cannot go back to Ayodhya. (Pray) permit me to accompany you to the forest."
"If you leave me even though I solicit you to take me with you, I shall enter a fire with chariot and all, here itself the moment I am forsaken by you"
"Oh, Rama! With the help of the chariot, I shall ward off those animals in the
forest, which create obstacles to your austerities."
"The pleasure of driving your chariot has been obtained by me because of you and it is through you that I seek the happiness that comes in dwelling in a forest."
"Be graceful. I desire to become your close associate in the forest. I wish to hear your loving assent with the words  be my close associate!"
"Oh, hero! If these horses too can render service to you, they can attain a supreme abode."
-"By all means, I am leaving for good, Ayodhya or even heaven. Dwelling in the
forest, with my head bent low, I shall render service to you."
"As a doer of wicked deeds cannot enter Amaravati, the capital of Devendra, so also I cannot enter Ayodhya without you."
"This is indeed my desire that after reaching the end of your exile, I may take you back to the city of Ayodhya in this very chariot."
"So long as I am with you together in the forest, fourteen years will slip away
momentarily. Otherwise than this, they will multiply a hundred- fold."
"Oh, prince, who are so fond of your dependents! You ought not abandon me, your
devoted servant, established in the path followed by the son of his master and (always)keeping within bounds."
Rama, who was compassionate towards his dependents, spoke as follows to Sumantra,
who was miserably entreating him again and again in many modes.
"Oh, charioteer so fond of your master! I know your excellent devotion to me. Hear wherefore I send you from here to the city of Ayodhya."
"Seeing you, returning to Ayodhya, Kaikeyi, my younger mother will get the proof
that Rama has gone to the forest."
"Having completely satisfied, about me having gone to forest, Kaikeyi will leave her strong suspicion that the virtuous king may be a person who speaks untruth."
"This is my first priority that my younger mother should get the extensive kingdom, protected by Bharata and thus ruled by her own son."
"For my pleasure and pleasure of the king, you go along with the chariot to Ayodhya and inform all the matters that you have been asked to tell each in the way you have been asked to do."
Having spoken thus to the charioteer, the courageous Rama consoled him again and
again. Then, he spoke the following reasoned words to Guha:
"Oh, Guha! This stay in the inhabited woods is not proper for me. My stay should
definitely be in a hermitage. Let an action diverted towards that aim be taken"
"I as such, wishing well of my father, Sita as well as Lakshmana and having taken up a discipline to be followed by ascetics, want to proceed further, wearing matted hair. Please bring the latex of a banyan tree."
Guha immediately brought that latex to the prince. With that, Rama made matted hair to himself and to Lakshmana.
Rama, tiger among men who possessed long arms wore the distinguished mark of an
ascetic (in the shape of matted hair) . Then, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers clad in the bark of trees and wearing a round mass of matted locks (on their head) looked bright like two ascetic sages.
Having adopted the way of a hermit (temporarily) along with Lakshmana, Rama then
accepted the vow of an ascetic life and spoke to Guha, his friend as follows:
"Oh, Guha! Remain vigilant in defense, finance, internal security and public
relations, for a kingdom is the most difficult one to be protected!"
Then Rama, who was a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty, bade farewell to Guha and departed quickly, remaining undistracted, along with his consort and together with Lakshmana.
Seeing the boat on the bank of the river and keen to cross the swift- flowing Ganga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: -
"Oh, Lakshmana the tiger among men! You get into the boat stationed here unhurriedly afterwards, having helped Sita the virtuous wife step into it."
Hearing the command completely of his elder brother, the prudent Lakshmana, by not counteracting it, made Sita to ascend the boat first and stepped into it afterwards.
Then, the glorious Rama got into the boat himself. Thereafter, Guha the ruler of
Nishadas commanded his kinsfolk to row them across the river.
After ascending the boat, Rama too of mighty splendor then recited a sacred text
(daiviim naavam etc) fit for brahmanas and Kshatriyas alike and conducive to his own good.
Having sipped water as per scriptures and with extreme delight, Rama with Sita made obeisance to that river. Lakshmana, of infinite splendor, followed suit.
Bidding farewell to Guha with his army of men and Sumantra, Rama sat on the boat and directed the boatmen to move on.
Propelled by those splendid and vigorous oarsmen, that boat furnished with a pilot, rapidly moved across the water.
Coming to the middle of Bhagirathi river, the irreproachable Sita with joined palms, spoke as follows to the said river: -
"Oh, Ganga! Let Rama, the son of the emperor Dasaratha honor his father's command
under your protection! Having dwelled in the forest in full fourteen years, may he return once more to your bank with his brother, Lakshmana and myself! Oh, blessed goddess Ganga! Returning safely, with all my desires fulfilled, I shall worship you with great joy."
You, Oh goddess flowing through three regions (namely heaven, earth and subterranean regions), include in your basin the realm of Brahma (the outermost of the six spheres enveloping the earth) and are vividly seen on this terrestrial plane as a consort of the ocean king."
"Oh, charming goddess! I, Sita, greet you and extol you too. When Rama the tiger
among men safely returns and regains his kingdom, I shall give away a lakh of cows, soft clothing and food to brahmanas with intent to please you."
"Oh, goddess! After reaching back the city of Ayodhya, I shall worship you with
thousand pots of spirituous liquor and jellied meat with cooked rice well prepared for the solemn rite."
"I shall worship all deities dwelling on your banks as also sacred spots and
sanctuaries."
"Oh, irreproachable goddess! May the sinless Rama (with mighty arms) re-enter
Ayodhya again from the forest, along with Lakshmana and myself."
Thus praying to Ganga, the efficient and irreproachable Sita rapidly reached the
right bank of the river.
Reaching the bank and leaving the boat, Rama the best among men and the chastiser of foes proceeded further along with Lakshmana and Sita.
Then, Rama the mighty armed, spoke to Lakshmana (who heightened the joy of Sumitra) as follows:
"Security is an inevitable need in a forest, which has unforeseen dangers and is
uninhabited, Oh, Lakshmana! Go in front. Let Sita follow you."
"I shall proceed in the rear, protecting you and Sita. Oh, jewel among men! We must accord protection here to one another."
"An act which has gone out of hand, whatsoever, cannot indeed be remedied again.
Sita will experience the hardship of staying in a forest only from now."
"Today she will enter the forest, where density of people is not seen, which is
utterly devoid of fields and gardens, has a rugged surface and is full of stumbles."
Listening to Rama's words, Lakshmana walked in front. Immediately after Sita, Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, advanced.
Constantly gazing at Rama, who reached soon the other bank of Ganga River, the
distressed Sumantra, his vision having failed due to the long distance and perturbed as he was, shed tears (of grief over separation from Rama).
Having crossed the great river, Rama the high-soled, the bestowal of boons, equal in glory with the guardians of spheres, then reached progressively the prosperous and the happy land of Vatsa; which contained rows of beautiful crops.
Having hunted there four deer, namely Varaaha, Rishya, Prisata; and Mahaaruru (the four principal species of deer) and taking quickly the portions that were pure, being hungry as they were, Rama and Lakshmana reached a tree to take rest in the evening.Then Guha the foremost dweller reported Bharata, who was having incomprehensible
qualities, about the quality of goodness of Lakshmana(as follows):
"I spoke as follows to that Lakshmana, who is endowed with virtues and wielding
arrows bow and a sword and who was keeping a vigil for the safe guard of his brother."
"O, dear brother! Here is a comfortable bed made ready for you. Feel yourself at
ease. Rest peacefully on this, O, delight of the Raghu race!"
"All my people are habituated for hardships, o virtuous prince! You are used to
comfort. Hence ,we shall keep awake for the safe guard of Rama."
"None is more dear to me than Rama on this earth. Moreover, do not become restless.I am telling this truth in your presence."
"By the grace of Rama, I wish to attain a very great renown in this earth, an
extensive acquisition of righteousness, an unalloyed wealth and enjoyment."
"I as such with a bow in my hand, along with my relatives will guard my dear friend Rama, who slept together with Seetha."
"Nothing is indeed unknown to me, who forever wander in this forest. We can defeat even an army consisting of all the four limbs in battle."
"Thus spoken as aforesaid by us the high soled Lakshmana, who perceives
righteousness alone,politely replied to all of us( as follows)
"How is it possible for me to get a sleep, or even life or comforts when Rama is
reposing on the floor along with Seetha?"
"O, Guha! Behold that Rama, who cannot be conquered in a battle even by all the
celestials and demons, sleeping on the blades of grass along with Seetha."
"This Rama is an excellent son, having qualities equal to those of Dasaratha. The
king obtained Rama by performing a great penance and after facing various troubles."
"When Rama having seen exiled, the king Dasaratha will not survive for long.This
earth will surely be without a husband soon."
"The women in the gynoecium's, having cried with a great noise, would have ceased
their crying out of fatigue. Now, the great noise would have stopped in the royal palace by now."
"I do not expect whether all of them, like Kausalya Dasaratha and even my mother
Sumitra will survive at all till this night."
"By beholding Shatrughna, my mother perhaps may even survive. However, the afflicted Kausalya who gave birth to the eminent Rama will surely die."
Without realising his long-cherished wish and failing to install Rama in the kingdom of Aodhya, my father Dasaratha will expire."
"Those who have accomplished their purpose (Shatrughna and others) will perform all the funeal honours to king Dasaratha, my father when the time comes for it."
"They will joyfully inhabit my father capital City, with its pleasant cross roads
and meeting places, with its main roads well laid out, sumptuous with large houses and lofty mansions, with all the gems they are encrusted, with elephants horses and chariots that abound there, the sound of trumpets with which the city resonates, the many diversions it contains, its properous and well-fed people, its luxurious gardens and parks as well as the assmeblies and festivals that continuously take place inti."
Shall we enter Ayodhya happily along with that virtuous Rama, who has truly redeemed his promise, when he completed his term of exile? While that magnamimous prince was lamenting thus, standing guard, the night passed.
"When the sun rose brightly in the next morning Rama and Lakshmana got their locks of hair matted into a thick mass at the banks of River Ganga and they were safely ferried by me."
"Rama and Lakshmana, who were capable of tormenting their enemies, possessing great strength, wearing matted locks of hari and clothes made of bark, like unto the leaders of herd of elephants, wielding excellent bow, arrows and sword, looking back at me, went away with Seetha.Hearing those most disagreeable words from Guha, Bharata began to think deeply,
directing his mind on Rama, of whom those unpleasant words were heard.
That gentle, extremely courageous and the mighty armed young prince, whose shoulders resembled a lion's his large eyes opening like a flowering lotus and having pleasing appearance, momentarily sighed and in his extreme anguish, sank to the ground suddenly like an elephant that has been wounded in the heart with goads.
Seeing Bharata unconscious, Guha growing pale, shook like a tree during an
earthquake.
Shatrughna, who stood near, taking Bharata, who was in that unconscious state in his arms, becoming non-pulsed, cried loudly, overcome as he was with grief.
Then, all the queens, emaciated through fasting, extremely miserable, being unable to find consolation for the sad end of their lord, rushed towards Bharata.
All of them, sobbing, surrounded Bharata who fell on the ground. Kausalya on her
part, torn with grief and bending over him, embraced him.
That affectionate Kausalya, agitated as she was with grief and looking miserable,
pressing him to her bosom as a cow its own calf, questioned Bharata (in the following words)
"O, son! I hope that no ailment afflicts your body. Now, the life of this royal race is indeed dependent on you."
"O, son! Rama along with Lakshman has gone to the forest. The king Dasaratha is
dead. I survive, looking on you. Now, you alone are the protector for us."
"I hope you have not heard any unpleasant news about Lakshmana or about Rama my one and the only son who left for the forest along with his wife."
Bharata of great renown, easing himself well within a moment, consoled Kausalya and while still weeping, spoke to Guha (as follows)
"O, guha! Tell me where did Rama my brother as also Seetha and Lakshmana halt in the night? On what couch and eating what, did he repose?
Guha, the Lord of Nishadas, thrilling with rapture, spoke to Bharata about the
manner in which he made arrangements for (feeding and reposing) his beloved and kind guest, Rama.
"Various kinds of food and drink and different varieties of fruits were brought
repeatedly by me to the presence of Rama for the purpose of his consumption."
Rama, the truly courageous man, refused all of them. Reminding himself of his
warrior's statute, he could not accept it.
"O, Bharata! We were pacified by that high-souled Rama by saying thus: ' O, friend! We are not allowed to receive anything we must always be givers."
"Rama, of great glory, then along with Seetha drank the water brought by Lakshman as observed fasting."
"Thereafter Lakshmana also drank the left-over water and those three practised
silence together in that evening-twilight.
"Lakshmana then personally brought a layer of Kusa grass and arranged a fittingly
nice bed with it for Rama immediately."
"Rama, along with Seetha, settled down on that bed. After washing their feet,
Lakshmana went away to a distance."
"Here at this fort of Ingndi Tree, on just this grass, on which both Rama and Seetha slept that night."
"Lakshmana, the scourge of his foe, wearing a glove of goha skin, strapping two
quivers full of arrows on either side of his back and wielding a great stringed bow, remained on his part walking round Rama during that night."
"Wearing excellent arrows and a bow along with my vigilant kinsmen carrying their
bows, I on my part remained near Lakshman, who was guarding Rama who vied with Indra the Lord of celestials."Distressed with anguish (to see Rama and Sita lying on the ground) Guha said to
Lakshmana, the scion of Raghu, who kept awake, through sincere love, for the protection of his brother Rama.
"Here is a comfortable bed made for you, my friend! Relax well comfortably on it,
Oh, prince!"
"All of us are habituated to hardships. You are habituated to comforts. We shall
keep awake this night, for the protection of Rama"
"For, none is dearer to me than Rama in this world. I speak the truth and swear to you by truth."
"I hope to acquire abundant acclaim and supreme merit in this world as also full
reward of wealth, by the sole grace of Rama"
"As such, I along with my kindred, shall protect my dear friend Rama who is reposing with Sita in every way, with bow in hand."
"Nothing is indeed unknown in this forest to me, where I wander continually. We can able to withstand even a vast army too, comprising of four parts (elephants, chariots, cavalry, and infantry)."
Then, Lakshmana replied to Guha as follows: "Oh, sinless Guha! Being protected by
you, who keep your duty alone in view, all of us are fearless in this land."
"When Rama, the son of Dasaratha is lying on the ground with Sita, how is it
possible for me to sleep or to enjoy the pleasures of life?"
"See that Rama, who cannot be vanquished in combat even by the gods and demons
combined, now sleeping profoundly on the grass along with Sita."
When Rama- who is endowed with similar characteristics as Dasaratha, uniquely
beloved, the son obtained by Dasaratha by virtue of his chanting of several sacred texts and austerities and by various undertakings (in the form of sacrificial performances) has gone to exile, the king will not live long and the earth will become surely widowed forthwith.
Having cried out in a high-pitched tone, the women having exhausted, will have
fallen silent and I am sure that a profound stillness reigns in the palace.
"I do not expect Kausalya, Dasaratha and my mother all of them to remain alive for this night."
"By looking forward to meet Satrughna, my mother might even stay alive. But it will be painful if Kausalya who has given birth to a heroic son, dies."
That city of Ayodhya, filled with devoted people, hitherto a source of joy and which brought pleasure to the world, when seized with agony over the king's death, will perish.
"How, in the absence of his magnanimous and the first born son, will the vital airs in the body of the generous king be maintained?"
"After the death of king, Kausalya will die. My mother also will die thereafter.
"Having failed to install Rama in the kingdom, failed forever, which was the most
cherished wish of his heart, my father will leave this world.
"Those who are fortunate will consecrate our deceased father and the king in the
course of all funeral rites, when the hour has struck.
People will joyfully move in the capital belonging to my father and the city with
its quadrangular places allocated at lovely sites, and well- aligned roads, rich in mansions of well-to-do men, temples and royal palaces adorned with the foremost of courtesans, its chariots horses and elephants that obstruct the roads, the musical instruments that resound there- full of all blessings and crowded with merry and well fed men, well- provided with gardens and royal parks
and bright with festivities carried on under the patronage of associations.
Will Dasaratha remain alive? After returning from exile, can we see the high-soled king Dasaratha of noble vows again?
Can we safely return to Ayodhya, after completion of the exile in the forest along with Rama who is faithful to his promises?
While the high-soled Lakshmana thus lamenting, stood on ground, afflicted with
anguish as he was, that night rolled away.
While Lakshmana (son of Dasaratha), who was concerned with the welfare of the
people; was thus speaking the truth out of his affection for his elder brother (Rama), Guha, overcome with agony and oppressed with adversity shed tears like an elephant tormented with fever.Just on seeing an army encamped and positioned along the River Ganga, Guha the king of Nishadas hastily spoke to his relatives as follows:
"On this side, a huge army is seen like an ocean. I am not able to comprehend the
extent of this army even by my discerning mind."
"Here is seen on that chariot, a towering banner bearing Kovidara tree and hence
Bharata himself with an evil intent seems to have come."
"Will Bharata the son of Kaikeyi bind us with chains or slay us? Or is he coming to kill Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who was exiled from the kingdom by his father, desirous as Bharata is to get the prosperous Ayodhya kingdom, a luxury and that which is inaccessible to another?"
"Rama the son of Dasaratha is my Lord and my companion too. Hence you, covered with armor, be stationed on this bank of Ganga River, desiring to advance the interest of Rama."
"Let all our ferrymen guarding the river, along with the troops, eating meat roots and fruits ( in their boats), stay positioned along the River Ganga."
"Let five hundred boats, each manner by a hundred youthful ferrymen, be stationed
and made ready" -thus announced Guha.
"If Bharata is favourably disposed now towards Rama, then only his army may (be
allowed to) cross the River Ganga in safety."
After uttering thus, Guha the king of Nishadas took fish, meat and honey as an
offering and approached Bharata.
Seeing him approach, Sumantra the charioteer, a majestic man who knows the rules of discipline, humbly told Bharata as follows:
"This Lord who is surrounded by a thousand of his own people, is fully acquainted
with the forest of Dandaka and also an old friend of your elder brother."
"O, Bharata! For that reason, let Guha the king of Nishadas see you. He knows surely where those two Rama and Lakshmana - are stationed."
Hearing the auspicious words of Sumantra, Bharata answered, "Introduce Guha to me
without delay."
Having obtained permission, Guha along with his own people, joyfully and humbly
approached Bharata and spoke as follows:
"This place is like a pleasure-grove near your house. We are your subjects and are reporting to you as such. Stay in this servant's house."
"Here are the roots and fruits gathered by my tribe as well as fresh and dried meat of great quality and of various kinds, and all a produce of the forest."
"I hope the army, after eating well, can halt for the night here. Furnished with all you could desire, you can continue your journey tomorrow along with your troops."When Lt Tara whose resplendence is similar to moonshine speaks that way, then Hanuma deems that Angada is 
laying siege to that kingdom of Vanaras. 
Hanuma considered Vali's son Angada indeed as having eightfold intelligence, fourfold tactics, and fourteen traits. 

Angada who is steadily brimming over with his spiritedness, mightiness, valorousness, and waxing like the moon 
starting from day one of White Fortnight of a month, is comparable to Brihaspati, the Jupiter, in the sagacity, 
who mirrors up his father Vali in intrepidity, but who is now assiduously attentive to the rebellious teachings 
of Lt. Tara, like Indra who once listened to the unlistenable teachings of demon's mentor, namely Shukraacaarya, 
as that Angada is overly enervated to fulfill the concerns of the king Sugreeva. Then Hanuma who is the scholar 
in all scriptures started to confederate the confidence of Angada with the present regime of Sugreeva. [, 
, ]
Hanuma then rhetorically started the schismatic secession of all those vanaras, who were desirous of avoiding 
Sugreeva and desiring a hideout, exemplifying the third ideation, namely the partition, among the four political 
ideations, viz., placation, presentation, partition, persecution. 
When Hanuma made all of the Banaras defect from Angada's idea of defecting Sugreeva, then Hanuma further overawed 
Angada with diverse and awesome orations containing the fourth ideation, namely the persecutory measures, employable 
by Sugreeva on defectors. 
"As with your father you are undeniably abler in warfare, oh, the son of Lady Tara, and as with your father you 
are unquestionably capable enough to sustain the monkey kingdom." Thus Hanuma started to address Angada. 
"Oh, best monkey, Angada, monkeys will be inconsistent at their will, won't they! Separated from their sons and 
wives they cannot tolerate to remain under your control for a long. 
"I tell you what is obvious. This Jambavanta, these monkeys like Niila, and great monkey Suhotra and others 
do not tagalong you, do it? Likewise, I too do not tagalong with you. Such as we are, it will 
be impossible for you to sidetrack us from Sugreeva using tactics like placation, presentation, or even persecution, 
isn't so? 
"Even if a might less is at odds with the mighty he can linger on, so to speak, therefore guard yourself, for no 
mediocrity will be at odds... 
"This matter of going underground into that Black Hole which you suppose as a hideout from Sugreeva, as you heard 
from Lt. Tara and others, but it is a deed of trifle to Lakshmana's arrows, not necessarily for Rama's arrows, 
in splitting apart the whole of that Black Hole in a trice. 
"Indeed, once Indra thudded his Thunderbolt on this very underground illusory place, but that act was indeed a 
trivial deed for that Thunderbolt made a single demonized aperture to eliminate a single demon, Maya, which we 
now called bila, Black Hole, nevertheless Lakshmana will splinter the whole of this 
Black Hole with his acute arrows, as if it is a leafy bowl. 
"There are numerous iron arrows with Lakshmana that are kindred to Thunderbolt of Indra, whose punch will be equalling 
that of Thunderbolt and Lightning Flashes, and which are the splitters of mountains. 
"As and when you settle down in that underground, more so, an unbefitting place for a crown prince, oh, enemyburner 
Angada, then and there all the monkeys will desert you resolvedly. 
"Always sulking and reminiscing on their sons and wives, and hungered for the proximity of their kinfolk and hungered 
for diverse palatability as any monkey would cherish, even so, lamenting on the beds of lament they push you backward. 

"Devoid of goodhearted friends and well-wishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such 
as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey, even from the shaking of a piece of straw.
"Devoid of goodhearted friends and well-wishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such 
as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey and you will end up much the same as a seamy shaky piece 
of straw. 
"By far, those fiercely frantic arrows of Lakshmana if targeted to kill you, in case you become a sidestepper 
from loyalties, will be terrifyingly twingeing. Further, those fiery frenetic arrows are irreversible. 
"But, if you return to Kishkindha along with us, and if you obediently become Sugreeva's flanker, he establishes 
you are only in the kingdom as before. 
"Your paternal uncle Sugreeva's gleam is his honesty as he is free of dishonesty, his desire is affection as he 
is free of aversion, his dedication is staunch as he is free of prevarication, and he is exoneration as 
he is free from exploitation, thus in no way he liquidate you. 
"He is your mother's wellwisher, the strife of Sugreeva's life is for her only, more so, there is no other posterity 
to him than you. Oh, Angada, therefore go back to Kishkindha, rather than deflecting, deviating, and deserting 
your kingdom. Thereafter, having offered his salutation to Seetha, who was present at the foot of the Ashoka 
tree, Hanuma spoke: "Thank heaven! I am seeing you uninjured here!"
Then, beholding again and again, that Hanuma, who had made ready for his return journey, 
Seetha spoke the following words, filled with affection towards her husband.
"O Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies! You are surely sufficient single-handed 
completion of this task. Your elevated energy is creditable indeed.
"But, it will be appropriate for Rama, who destroys the hostile forces, to take me with 
him, after routing Lanka with his arrows."
"Therefore, you act in such a way that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, may exhibit 
prowess worthy of him."
Hearing those humble, reasonable, and meaningful words of Seetha, Hanuma spoke the following 
words in reply.
"Rama, accompanied by the leaders of monkeys and bears, will come soon and after conquering 
the enemies in battle will take away your grief."
Hanuma, the son of the wind god, thus consoling Seetha and making up his mind to go, saluted 
Seetha with reverence.
Thereafter, Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, and the annihilator of enemies, 
with an anxious desire to see his lord, ascend the Mount Arishta of excellence.
That mountain was covered as it were with dark green rows of gardens inhabited by towery 
elephants with red spots on their skin and with clouds hanging between their summits, as with an upper 
garment.
By metals scattered here and there, looking like eyes drawing up the eye-lids, the mountain 
looked like being awakened, as it were, with love by the bright rays of the sun.
The mountain looked resembling the one which has started reciting the scriptures clearly 
in the form of the deep sound of running streams of water, singing as it were at a high pitch, in the 
form of roaring sound of various cascades.
The mountain stood as it were with uplifted arms in the form of very lofty deodars and 
which started crying loudly as it were, on all sides, in the form of the sound of its cascades.
The mountain seemed to be trembling in the form of waving dark autumnal groves, which 
was piping as it were, in the form of hollow bamboo shaken up by the wind and whistling.
The mountain was hissing as it were with fury, in the form of its terrible and most poisonous 
snakes and which sat absorbed in meditation as it were, in the form of its deep caves covered with mist.
The mountain seems to be setting out on a journey on all four sides, with the feet of the 
mountain, looking like rising clouds, which with its peaks having a lining of clouds, seemed to stretch 
its limbs in the sky.
The mountain was embellished with several summits and adorned with numerous caves 
scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, palmyra, Karna, and bamboo trees.
The mountain was adorned with clusters of creepers having plenty of flowers, filled with 
several summits and adorned with numerous caves scattered at many places and endowed with many sals, 
Palmyra, Karna, and bamboo trees.
The mountain was endowed with many cascades, crowded together with heaps of rocks and 
frequented by great sages, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, and celestial serpents.
The mountain was exquisite with creepers and trees, having caves inhabited by lions, 
spread over with several tigers and endowed with sweet roots and fruit trees.
Hanuma, the son of the wind god, in a hurry to see Rama, ascended that mountain, excited 
as he was with extreme joy.
Then, the rocks in the charming table-land of the mountain, on which the soles of Hanuma 
lied heavily, were crushed with noise, and fell to pieces.
Desirous of reaching the northern shore from the southern shore of that ocean, Hanuma 
ascended that mountain and enlarged his body.
Then, the valiant Hanuma after ascending the mountain, saw the terrific ocean inhabited 
by fishes and water snakes.
Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and the son of the wind god, entered the sky towards 
northern direction, like a wind, from the southern direction.
Pressed at that moment by Hanuma, that excellent mountain sank into the bowels of the 
earth along with the various living beings and made a noise with its shaking summits and toppling trees.
Shaken by the impetus of the thighs of Hanuma, trees in blossom were broken and fell 
on earth, as though struck by a thunderbolt.
When the lions of great prowess dwelling amid caves were tormented and roared 
that roaring noise was heard as it was piercing the sky.
The females of the Vidyadhara class of supernatural beings, with their raiments in disorder 
through fear and their ornaments fell off, and went up all of a sudden from the mountain.
Large poisonous serpents of immense size, possessing vigor and having fiery tongues 
with their hoods and necks severely pressed and lay coiled.
Then, leaving that tormented mountain of excellence; Kinnaras, Nagas, Gadharvas, Yakshas 
and Vidyadharas ascended to the sky.
Pressed down by that strong Hanuma, that beautiful mountain having its elevated summits 
crowned with trees, entered the bowels of the earth.
That mountain, with a width of ten yojanas (or eighty miles) and a height of thirty yojanas 
(or two hundred and forty miles), got level with the earth.
With a desire to cross easily the terrific ocean, whose shores were being lashed by its 
waves, Hanuma jumped up into the air.Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Dadhimukha the monkey was pleased and offered his salutation 
with reverence to Rama, Lakshmana
After offering salutation to Sugreeva and the mighty Rama and Lakshmana, Dadhimukha 
accompanied by his valiant monkeys, sprang into the air.
That Dadhimukha, after entering Madhuvana, saw all the chiefs of monkeys, who were free 
from their intoxication, having passed off the honey and who were inwardly excited.
With his hands joined together for salutation, that valiant Dadhimukha approached them 
and cheerfully spoke the following gentle words to Angada.
"O, gentle sir! Due to their ignorance, these guards in anger obstructed you from entering 
the grove. No resentment should be harboured by you about this obstruction."
"O exceedingly strong Angada! You are the prince and also the master of this grove. We 
have made a mistake
"O faultless Angada! After going there, I indeed informed your uncle about the arrival 
of all these monkeys here."
"Hearing your arrival along with these leaders of monkeys, your uncle was exceedingly 
pleased. Even after hearing of Madhuvana having been attacked, he did not develop any anger."
"Sugreeva, your uncle, the lord of monkeys and the king was pleased and told me, 'Send 
all the monkeys here'."
Hearing these smooth words of Dadhimukha, the eloquent Angada, the foremost among the 
monkeys, spoke to those monkeys as follows:
"O the foremost of monkeys, the tormentors of enemies! I assume that Rama might have 
heard the news (of our arrival). Hence, it is not proper for us to remain here any longer, now that 
our work has been accomplished."
"The monkeys are taking, rest, after drinking the honey to their heart's content. What 
is there remaining, except to go to the place where Sugreeva my uncle is there?"
"I shall do whatever all the leaders of monkeys together tell me. I am obedient to you, 
in the matter of what ought to be done."
"I am not the master to command you, even though I am the crown prince. It is not befitting 
for me to play the lord over you, who have accomplished the task."
Hearing the indeclinable words spoken thus by Angada, the monkeys with their pleased 
minds spoke to him (as follows:
"O prince, the foremost of monkeys! Who would speak like this, while he is the lord? 
Everyone indeed thinks one's supremacy with an excited arrogance and says 'I, I'."
"It is so worthy of you alone that you have spoken such words. One else can utter like 
this. Your humility itself is telling of your future suitableness for prosperity."
"All of us, who reached here, are waiting for the right moment to go to that place where 
Sugreeva, the imperishable king of the heroic monkeys, is."
"O the excellent of monkeys! Without your command, it is not possible for the monkeys 
anywhere, even a step forward. We are speaking this truth to you."
While they were thus speaking; Angada replied, "Let us go." The mighty monkeys then sprang 
into the air.
All those leaders of monkey-troops, like stones shot from a catapult, making the space 
space-less followed Angada, who was springing forward.
Those monkeys with speed, sounding forth a loud noise, sprang into the sky, like clouds 
driven by the wind.
Even before Angada landed there, Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spoke to the louts-eyed 
Rama, who was afflicted with grief (as follows):
"Be pacified! Happiness to you! The princess has been seen. There is no doubt. When 
the time earlier fixed by us exceeds the limit, they can't come here."
"Angada, the long-armed prince and the most excellent of monkeys does not make his appearance 
before my vicinity if the work is ruined."
"Even if such an exploit may be possible by these monkeys who have not been able to accomplish 
their work, Angada would have worn a sad face and felt perplexed and scattered in mind."
"If Angada the lord of the monkeys had not rejoiced, he would not have damaged my madhuvana, 
which belongs to my father and grandfather as well as protected by my forbears. Get consoled well, O 
virtuous Rama, the splendid son of Kausalya!"
"Seetha was seen. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen Seetha. There 
is indeed none other than Hanuma, who is the executor."
"O Rama, having a very good understanding! In Hanuma, qualities like the capacity to accomplish 
any object, intelligence, strenuous effort and vigour are unchangeable, like splendour in the sun."
"Where Jambavan is a leader; Angada as the commander of troops and Hanuma as 
the administer, the progress of that work cannot be as otherwise."
"O Rama, of unlimited prowess! Do not encounter troubled thoughts now!" Meanwhile, when 
the monkeys, who are proud of Hanuma's performance and who are making noise as though they are proclaiming 
the accomplishment of their act are approaching Kishkindha Sugreeva hears certain sounds expressing 
joy, in the vicinity of the sky."
Then, hearing that clamour of the monkeys, Sugreeva the chief of the monkeys rejoiced 
at heart, duly stretching and curling up his tail (in joy).
Keeping Angada and Hanuma in front of them, those monkeys too arrived with their eagerness 
to see Rama.
Those heroes, having Angada as their chief, were exceedingly pleased as they were and filled 
with joy, landed in the vicinity of Sugreeva and Rama.
Thereafter, the mighty-armed Hanuma, offering his salutation by bending his head low, 
informed Rama that Seetha the princess is constant in devotion to Rama and sound in body.
Hearing the nectar-like words, saying "Seetha was found" from the mouth of Hanuman, Rama 
and Lakshmana felt happy.
Thereupon, Lakshmana with love looked with reverence at the joyful Sugreeva, who earlier 
decidedly apprised about the aforesaid Hanuma, having accomplished the task.
Rama, the annihilator of hostile heroes, who obtained great joy, looked at Hanuma with 
a high esteem.Hearing those words of Seetha, the eloquent Hanuma was very much pleased and spoke to 
Seetha (as follows):
"O Seetha, the beautiful princess! Whatever you spoke is befitting. It is in keeping 
with woman's nature and humility of a chaste woman."
"It is indeed not fit for a woman to mount on my back and traverse an extensive ocean, 
which is having a width of one hundred yojanas."
"O Seetha endowed with modesty! The second reason you mentioned that you would not be 
touching anyone else other than Rama is befitting of you, the wife of that high-soled Rama. O princess! 
which other lady except you can speak of such sweet words?"
"O princess! I can completely inform Rama of all that you have done and of all that you 
have spoken before me."
"O princess! All this was told by me because for several reasons, being desirous of doing 
good to Rama and with my mind moistened with affection towards him."
"I spoke this because of the unassailability of Lanka, its great ocean so difficult to 
be crossed and also my capacity of taking you."
"Because of my great affection and devotion towards you, I wish to carry you well now 
itself to Rama your husband. These words were not spoken by me with any other motive."
"O faultless Seetha! If you are not willing to go with me, give me a token of remembrance 
that Rama can recognize."
Hearing Hanuma's words, Seetha like the daughter of a god, slowly spoke the following 
words, strung together with alphabets of tears: "You tell this (following) excellent thing as a token 
of remembrance to my beloved husband."
"There is a place inhabited by sages at a hillock in the north-eastern It was bountiful 
with roots fruits and water. In that place, while we were residing in a hermitage of sages, on a day 
long ago, we were strolling in water in parts of groves with various kinds of flowers of perfume in 
that hillock. You thereupon became wet and sat in my proximity."
"Then, a crow, yearning for meat, began to peck me. Picking up a clod of earth, I prevented 
the crow from its act."
"Pecking me again and again, the crow was hiding there only. That crow, yearning for 
food did not resign from meat."
"While I was angry with that bird, my skirt was slipping and I was pulling its string 
(to tighten it). I was seen by you then."
"Moved by anger, I felt abashed for being laughed at by you. Torn down by the crow, which 
was yearning for food, I sought shelter with you."
"Feeling tired, I again settled on your lap. As though angry, I was consoled by you and 
I was fully delighted."
"Slowly wiping my eyes, my face filled with tears, I was seen by you, O Lord, as having 
been annoyed by the crow."
"I even slept for a long time on Rama's lap because of my fatigue. In his turn, Rama 
the elder brother of Bharata slept in my arms."
"Meanwhile, the same crow appeared there. Descending all of a sudden, the crow clawed 
me at the space between the breasts, even as I awoke from my sleep and rose from the lap of Rama. Flying 
up again, it tore me up a lot."
"Then, Rama got wet by the discharged drops of blood. Thereafter, that splendorous Rama, 
the annihilator of enemies, who was in a pleasant slumber, was woken up by that crow and by me who was 
grievously tormented by the crow."
"That long-armed Rama, seeing me pierced violently on the breasts, then spoke the following 
words, hissing like an angry serpent.
"O Seetha the round-thighed woman! Who has wounded the space between your breasts? who 
is playing with a fire-faced serpent filled with fury?"
'Then, throwing a glance around, Rama saw that crow with its sharp claws moistened with 
blood and sitting in front of me alone."
"That crow, the best among birds, seems to be the son of Indra the Lord of celestials, 
staying in mountains and moving with a speed equal to the wind."
"Then, the long-armed Rama, the best among wise men, swirling his eyes in anger, made 
a resolve in the matter of that ferocious crow."
"Taking a blade of Kusa grass from his bed ( made of Kusa grass), Rama employed it to 
work with Brahma's missile (a mythical weapon that deals with infallible destruction). That blazing 
shoot of grass, resembling a fire destroying the world, flared up in front of that bird."
"As Rama threw that blazing blade of Kusa grass towards that crow, that blade of grass 
went chasing that crow in the sky."
"Then, while that blade of grass came chasing, that crow went flying in many a way. Seeking 
protection, it roamed all over the world."
"Roaming the three worlds in search of a savior, that crow was abandoned by Indra; its 
father, the celestials, and the sages. Finally, it sought refuge in the same Rama."
"That Rama, who affords protection, was compassionate and protected that crow, which 
fell on the ground (in salutation to Rama) and sought for protection, even though it was apt to be killed."
"Seeing that crow, coming exhausted and dejected, Rama said to it: 'It is not possible 
to make Brahma missile a waste. For this reason, tell me what to do now."
Thereafter, that crow said, "Let your arrow shoot my right eye." Then that blade of Kusa 
grass shot the right eye of that crow. By giving away its right eye in that way, the crow saved its 
life."
"After offering salutations to Rama and King Dasaratha and being discharged by that valiant 
Rama, the crow returned to its abode."
"O lord of the earth! For my sake, you hurled a Brahma's missile even at a crow. Why are 
you forgive the one who has taken me away from you?"
"O Rama the best among men! You, with great strength, annihilate the enemy and bestow 
your mercy on me. O Lord! She who has a protector in you looks like one without any protector."
"You told me that kindness is the best righteousness. I know you, have great 
prowess, great energy, and great strength. I know your non-acquiescence, imperturbability, profoundness 
like an ocean, as Lord of the earth including the oceans and as equal to Indra the Lord of celestials."
"O Rama! Even though you are strong, excellently skilled in archery, and a truthful man, 
why are you not utilizing your arrow on demons?"
"Neither the serpent-demons nor the divine musicians nor the demons nor the storm-gods 
can resist the onrush of Rama in battle."
"If the valiant Rama has any haste in my case, why does he not destroy the demons with 
his sharp arrows?!
"For what reason, even Lakshmana the tormentor of enemies, the mighty man and the valiant 
man does not protect me, by taking the command of his elder brother?'
Those two tigers among men, Rama and Lakshmana, with a sharpness equal to that of wind 
and fire, even if they are unconquerable by demons too, why are they neglecting me?"
"There is no doubt that I would have committed a great sin, for which reason those two 
brothers Rama and Lakshmana the tormentors of enemies, even when capable, are neglecting me."
Hearing the pitiable appeal Seetha with tears, Hanuma of great splendor and the son 
of wind-god spoke (as follows)
"O Seetha! Rama has grown averse to everything else, caused by grief towards you. I swear 
it to you by truth. When Rama is overpowered by grief; Lakshmana too gets tormented by grief."
"O faultless Seetha! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not the 
time to lament. You will see the end of your sorrow within a short time."
"Those two mighty princes, the excellent among men, are eager to see you and they will 
reduce Lanka to ashes."
"O large-eyed Seetha! Killing the cruel Ravana along with his relatives in battle, Rama 
will take you back to his city."
"Tell me what to be expressed to Rama or the mighty Lakshmana or the splendorous 
Sugreeva or even to the other monkeys assembled there."
Hearing the words of Hanuma, Seetha, like the daughter of a sage, tormented with grief, 
spoke to Hanuma the monkey (as follows):
"On my behalf, salute by bowing your head and ask about the welfare of Rama, the Lord 
of the worlds, to whom the magnanimous Kausalya gave birth."
(On my behalf, ask about the welfare of ) Lakshmana, that good child of Sumitra who, 
having renounced the wreaths of flowers, all the riches, pleasant and beautiful girls, and even the prosperity 
difficult to be obtained in this extensive world, offered his profound respects to and pacified his 
father and mother, followed Rama to exile."
"Renouncing a great comfort, the righteous Lakshmana, acting in an affectionate manner 
towards Rama, followed him, watching over him in the forest."
"Lakshmana, who has broad shoulders like that of a lion, mighty-armed, steady-minded and 
having pleasant looks, behaves towards Rama as towards his father and looks to me as his mother."
"The valiant Lakshmana, on that day of occurrence, did not know that I was being taken 
away by Ravana. He serves elders. He possesses a splendor. Though capable, he does not talk much. To 
Dasaratha, my father-in-law, he is his replica a beloved and the best prince."
"Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama is the one who is dearer to me always. That energetic 
Lakshmana carries out well, whatever load of work is entrusted to him"
"Seeing whom, Rama ceases to recollect his deceased father, that Lakshmana is to be asked 
about his well-being, as my word, and on my behalf."
"O Hanuma, the excellent of monkeys and the best of monkeys! you are the model for fulfilling 
this act of addressing him in such a way that Lakshmana, the mild, every-pure, and clever darling of 
Rama may bring my sorrows to an end."
"Depending on your effort, Rama will be more active with his effort the following words 
again and again to Rama, my Lord and the hero:"
"O Rama! I shall hold my life for a month. I cannot survive after a month I am telling 
you the truth."
"O valiant man! You are required to rescue me, detained (as I am) by Ravana the criminal 
and subjected to humiliation, as you (as Lord Vishnu) earlier protected Indra the Lord of Celestials 
and Lakshmi the goddess of prosperity from the abode of servants and demons."
Then, untying the bright divine jewel for her head tied in her garment, Seetha gave it 
to Hanuma, saying that it might be handed over to Rama.
Taking the excellent jewel, the valiant Hanuma thereupon fitted it to his finger, since 
his arm (even though he had assumed his former tiny form), was not fitting to it properly.
Receiving that jewel, Hanuma the best among the monkeys, offered his salutation to Seetha, 
by engaging himself in circumambulation and stood aside with humbleness.
Filled with a great delight, born out of Seetha's discovery by him, that Hanuma mentally 
sought (the presence) of Rama but stood there with just his physical body.
Taking that excellent and highly venerable jewel, worn by Seetha and by its influence 
resembling one who was shaken by a blast coming from the top of a huge mountain, Hanuma was mentally 
pleased and set out to cross the ocean on his return journey."On seeing that best monkey Hanuma, who is burgeoning to cross over the hundred
yojana-ocean and who is also quickly, progressively, and stupendously maximizing his body, the
other monkeys instantly shunning off their sadness, raved and rhapsodized over that staggeringly
mighty monkey, Hanuma. 
Those monkeys available all over there are altogether buoyed up and utterly
astounded, and as with the people who have enthusiastically seen Narayana when He maximized His
physique to tread the triad of worlds in His Trivikrama incarnation, these monkeys too are looking
at Hanuma who is now maximising his body. 
Hanuma who is already an outmatching monkey by way of his energy, has now accrued
added energy obtained through the gladness derived by the way of extolment from other monkeys, and
then he impetuously lashed his tail and oversized himself. 
His physique is reinforced with resplendence while all the monkey chiefs
are eulogizing him has become unsurpassed in its form. 
Hanuma, the lineal son of Air-god, is now prancing about with a lion prancing
around a wide-open den of a mountain. 
While he is inflating the face of that clever Hanuma shines forth like a red-hot
frying pan and like the fumeless white-hot Ritual-fire. 
On bestirring himself from among the monkeys, and on reverencing the elderly
monkeys, Hanuma said this, with a spine-tingling sensation in his body. 
"He who is an inestimable one in his formidableness, and an expeditious one in his
meandering in the skies, that Air-god who is the friend of the Fire-god will be toppling
mountaintops...... 
"I am the lineal son of that high-speeded, brisk-paced, life-sustaining Air god,
hence I am a coequal to him in flights... 
"Indeed shall I venture to go round the Mt. Meru, which is standing like a broad and
lofty scribe-pawl scribing on the sky, for thousands of times, that too, unremittingly...

" Or, shall I venture to skew down the ocean with the speed of my undulating arms to
spiral up its waters, to completely inundate the world together with its mountains, rivers
and lakes... 
"Shall I shove up the ocean, the abode of Rain-god, with the speed of my thighs and
calves so that underwater beings like sharks, alligators, and crocodiles will be shoved up
and spilled all over... 
"Shall I make circumambulations for thousands of times around the Lord of Birds and
the viper-diner, Garuda, while he is on the wing in the sky... 
"Oh, best fly-jumpers, just by my astounding and astonishing impetuosity shall I
venture to start with the Sun who starts his journey of the day from Mt. Sunrise, and shall I go to
Mt. Dusk before Sun, and again shall I venture to come even before the sundown towards the same
day's flaming Sun when he is garlanded with flaming sunrays around him in midday, that too without
by touching the land... 
"Shall I overtake all the wayfarers in skyway, or shall I parch down the ocean, or
pare off the earth... 
"Or, shall I pulverize the mountains while fly-jumping on them, or oh, fly-jumpers,
shall I splash out the waters great ocean just by the speed of my thighs while I fly over it, by
which all of its water will trail after my tail... 
"Or, shall I now let divers flowers of every climbing plant and tree struggle after
me when I fly by the sky... then my flight path will become like that of Star Swati and its
constellate stars twinkling in the sky... 
"Oh, vanara-s, shall I make all beings see my northerly ascent to the sky, my
movement across the vast sky, and my southerly descent from the sky... 
"Oh, fly-jumpers, shall I show you a prodigious me spanning the sky like massive Mt.
Meru and flying with a propulsive force as though to swallow the sky... 
"While flying self-assuredly shall I swipe at the cloudscape helter-skelter, or
shall I swirl the mountains topsy-turvy, or shall I see the ocean pell-mell... 
"Which forcefulness either the Divine Eagle, Garuda, or Air-god has, mine vies with
that... and no being is tangible who can follow up on me to overtake while I am on the wing,
excepting for the king of eagles, Garuda and the almighty Air-god... 
"Shall I penetrate the supportless sky in a split-second, like an electric flash
rocketing from a black cloud in a trice? 
"When I am jumping over the ocean, now my aspect will indeed become like that of
Vishnu who in those days easily paced the triad of worlds just in three paces... 
"Oh, fly-jumpers, I am perceiving by my percipience and the different
strokes of my perspicacity are similarly prognostic... and I avouch that I will descry Vaidehi...
hence, rejoice yourselves... 
"I who am a coequal of Air-god in speediness, and of Garuda in fleetness, can
traverse ten-thousand yojana-s at a stretch... that is my certitude... 
"I will fetch that Elixir from the hands of Self-created Brahma, or the hands of
Indra even if he is wielding his Thunderbolt just on fleetly triumphing over him... or, I can even
bring isle of Lanka itself extracting it from the ocean... thus is my confidence..." So said Hanuma
to the other monkeys. 
While that choicest vanara with illimitable resplendence, namely Hanuma, is roaring
out his capabilities in the matter of leaping ocean on enormously increasing his physique, all the
other monkeys are stunned to stare overhead at his aggrandized form and thus they are extremely
gladdened. 
On hearing the avouchment of Hanuma, which itself is an annihilator of the anguish
of his kinsmen, then the king of fly-jumpers Jambavanta is very much gladdened and said. [--b,
a]
"Oh, brave one, oh, son of Kesari, oh, son of Air-god, oh, dear boy, you have wiped
out the boundless bother of your kinsmen in its entirety... 
"The monkey leaders forgathered here are enamored of your blessedness, and for the
purpose of your attainment of the object, they all obsecrate orisons, devoutly... [--b,
a]
"You will leap over the extensive ocean with the compassion of sages, choice of
elderly monkeys, and with the consideration of our oracular teachers... 
"Each of us will stay here on one's single foot till you arrive, as the lives of
all the forest-dwelling monkeys are following you..." Thus Jambavanta blessed Hanuma to initiate
action. 
Then that tiger monkey Hanuma said to the forest-dwelling monkeys, "Even so, in
this world whosoever he might be, either animate or inanimate being, he cannot possibly bear the
the brunt of my bouncing... 
"This Mt. Mahendra is beaming forth with boulders and altitudinal cliffs, and the
crests of this mountain are indeed tough, and even towering... 
"Diversely outspread are its trees, and divers are its transuding ores, thus this
the mountain is shining forth... hence, from the peaks of this Mt. Mahendra I will gain speed for my
kick-start... 
"On the verge of my upstart from here for a hundred yojana-s, these sturdy crags are
sure to withstand the impetus of that kick-start... 
Then that monkey who is the son of Air-god and a selfsame of Air-god shinned up that
towering mountain Mahendra, as he is an enemy-subjugator about to subjugate the arch-rival Ravana,
where that mountain is hedged in with diverse flowers, its pastures are the sweethearts of deer, it
is constrictive with diverse flowers of ever flowering, ever fruiting trees and with the flowers of
climbers as well, and where lions and tigers are freely moving and ruttish elephants love it, and
where the flights of birds are uproarious, and pent-up rapids are clangorous. [--, ,
]
He who is equal in valor to the Paradisiacal Mahendra, that highly energetic and
grand monkey Hanuma ambled on the loftiest and towery crags of such a mountain. 
When squeezed by both the arms and hands of that high-souled Hanuma, that lofty
mountain trumpeted as if it was a lion-paw-hit brutish-elephantine-elephant. 
Virtually and widely bestrewn are the heaps of boulders, essentially scared are all
the animals and elephants, and rocked are the gigantic trees, and its rapids and
waterfalls have spouted out of that mountain by the impact of the foot-stepping of Hanuma.

Then, the numerous Gandharva couples and the hoards of vidhyaadhara-s even, that are
indulged in drinking and inebriated on that mountain are forsaking those lofty cliffs of that
mountain and even the birds are put to flight, spanking snakes are completely slouching, and
rising and falling are the stones of that mountaintops to each step of Hanuma, and thus
that colossal mountain is desolate. 
With snakes popping up halfway through their snake pits with their hoods swaying and
tongues hissing that earth-borne mountain Mahendra appeared to be a gleaming mountain with flying
flags. 
While the sages are forsaking that towering mountain as their scare bewildering
them, that mountain appeared to be one who was desolated by his associates in the vast thick of
forest, as a wilting wayfarer. 
And he who is an importantly brave monkey among all the monkeys, an eliminator of
enemy stalwarts, that highly proficient, expeditious, and conscientious Hanuma, on stabilizing his
impulses and making soul is quite staid in speediness, he made head away to Lanka, instinctually.

Thus, this is the third, and conclusive chapter
of Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India.
Thus reflecting on many kinds of thought, Hanuma spoke the following sweet words within the hearing 
range of Seetha.
"There was a king named Dasaratha who was very glorious among the kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty and 
had a virtuous disposition. He owned chariots, elephants, and horses, becoming very famous.
"He was excellent in virtues among royal sages. He was equal to the seven sages in austerity. He 
was born in the lineage of emperors and was equivalent to Indra in prowess."
"He was keen on harmlessness. He was not vulgar. He was compassionate. He was truly mighty. He 
was an eminent king in the Ikshvaku race. He was endowed with prosperity and was causing to increase prosperity."
"The king Dasaratha was endowed with royal characteristics, highly prosperous, excellent among 
kings and highly prosperous, excellent among kings and famous on earth with its four borders. He was a happy man 
and gave happiness to others."
"There was an eldest son named Rama to that Dasaratha. Rama was beloved having a moon-like face. 
He knows the distinctions between humans and others. He was excellent among all the wielders of the bow."
"That Rama who annihilates enemies, is a protector of his mode of life, a protector of his 
people, a protector of every living being, and a protector of righteousness."
"By the command of that Dasaratha, his old father, and true-speaking man, that Rama a brave man 
went on exile to a forest along with his wife and brother."
"While hunting in that forest, Rama killed many demons who were valiant and who could assume 
any form at will."
"Thereafter, hearing about the killing of demons in Janasthana, a part of Dandaka forest, in addition 
to the killing of Khara and Dushana the demons, the enraged Ravana took away, Seetha, by deceiving Rama into creating 
an illusive image of deer in the forest."
"Searching for Seetha the irreproachable lady, Rama met a monkey called Sugreeva as his friend 
in the forest."
"Thereafter, Rama the conqueror of the enemy's cities and very strong man, killed Vali and gave away 
that kingdom of monkeys to Sugreeva."
"As commanded and sent by Sugreeva, thousands of monkeys capable of assuming form at their will, 
are searching for that lady Seetha in all quarters of the earth."
"By the words of Sampati, I a swift monkey crossed the ocean having a length of one hundred yojanas 
for the sake of this broad-eyed Seetha."
"This Seetha has been found by me according to the same comeliness, complexion, and bodily marks 
as I had heard from Rama."
Having spoken these words, Hanuma kept quiet. Hearing those words, Seetha too got a great surprise.
Thereafter, Seetha whose consciousness was enshrouded by affliction, whose hair ends were 
curved, and who was fearful, lifted her face and looked towards the Shimshupa tree.
Hearing Hanuma's words and looking at all quarters and sub-quarters, Seetha was recollecting Rama 
in all ways and obtained great joy.
Looking at the sides, up and down, Seetha saw that Hanuman, the son of wind-god, had an unimaginable 
intelligence, the minister of Sugreeva, and looking like the sun behind an eastern mountain.Seeing the valiant Lakshmana bathed in a stream of blood, when struck down in battle
with a spear by the mighty Ravana and having given a tumultuous fight, to the evil-minded Ravana,
Rama spoke as follows to Sushena, even while releasing a multitude of arrows (at Ravana).
"This heroic Lakshmana, falling down on earth yielding to Ravana's prowess, is
wiggling like a serpent, causing an increase in grief to me."
"My energy to fight is failing, even as I see this valiant Lakshmana, who is dearer
to me than life, bathed in blood, my mind being greatly disturbed."
"Of what use is life or happiness to me, if this illustrious brother of mine, who is
endowed with auspicious bodily marks and who always speaks highly of war, meets with his
death?"
"My valour is feeling shy, as it were. My bow seems to fall down from any hand. My
arrows are dropping down. My vision has been overcome with tears."
"My limbs seem to sink down, like those of men in sleep. I have a serious tension,
growing in me. I even wish to die."
"My brother has been struck down by the evil-minded Ravana, seriously wounded in his
vital parts, afflicted with agony and groaming."
Seeing his beloved brother, who was his very life-breath moving outside, Rama was
afflicted with excessive agony and gave himself up to anxiety and grief.
Seeing Lakshmana his brother lying wounded in the dust of the battle-field, he got
into extreme despondency and lamented (as follows), confused in mind, as he was:
"O the valiant Lakshmana! Even victory cannot create a pleasure for me. What
pleasure can the moon create for a man who has lost his vision?"
"What purpose of mine will be served by fighting or eve by life? When this Lakshmana
lies killed in the forefront of battle here, I have no use for the war."
"In the same way as the very glorious Lakshmana followed me When I was going to the
forest, I too will in the same way follow him to the abode of Yama the lord of Death."
"The demons, who fight treacherously, created this condition to Lakshmana, who loved
his relatives and who was ardently devoted forever to me."
"Wives may be obtained ever where. Relatives can be had every where. However, I do
not find a brother, born of the same womb, at such a place whatesoever."
The monkeys saw that Rama, thus lamenting with his mind reeling and distressed in
grief and pitiably sighing his breath repeatedly.
"Of what use is the kingdom for me, without Lakshmana, who was difficult to over
power? What can I tell to Sumitra, the mother who was so fond of her son?"
"I shall not be able to bear the reproach, which will be levelled by Sumitra. What
shall I pay to kausalya the mother or what shall I say to Kaikeya?"
"What shall I say to Bharata or to the mighty Shatrughna, when they ask me, how I
came back without Lakshmana even though I went to the forest along with him?"
"It is better to die at this place only, rather than hear the reproaches of one's
own people. What sinful act was done by me in a previous birth due to which my righteous brother
lies killed before me?
"Alas! O the powerful brother, the best of men! O the foremost among the valiant
men! Why are you going to the other world, deserting me?"
"O brother! Why don't you talk to me, even though I am lamenting? Rise and see! Why
are you lying down? See me, by opening your own eyes, miserable as I am."
"O the mighty armed! You have been indeed comforting me, whenever stricken with
grief, I roamed listlessly among mountains and forests or felt low-spirited."
Comforting Rama, whose mind was full of grief and who was thus lamenting, Sushena,
for his part, addressed the following excellent words:
"O the excellent among men! Give up this notion, which causes despondency in you,
this anguish which gives rise to grief and is as piercing as arrows, in the forefront of
battle."
"Lakshmana, the augmenter of prosperity, has not got into death. His countenance is
not changed, nor has it become dark."
"His face may be seen with a good brightness and very much placid. The palms of his
hands are resembling the petals of a lotus. His eyes too are very bright."
"O king! The appearance of the dead does not look like this. O hero, the annihilator
of enemies! He is all with his life. Do not worry."
"The repeatedly beating heart with the signs of breath of Lakshmana, lying on the
earth's surface, fast asleep, with his limbs relaxed are telling it, O the gallant prince!"
Having addressed the words thus to Rama, the highly learned Sushena spoke the
following words to Hanuma the great monkey, who was standing nearby:
"Proceeding from this place with full speed, O gentle one!, to the mountain called
Oushadhi (Mahodaya), which was already described to you previously by Jambavan, O brave one! Bring
here for restoring the great-souled and heroic Lakshmana to consciousness, the precious herb
Vishalyakarani (1) by name which was sprung up on its southern peak, Savarnakarnani (2),
Samjivakarani(3) and the precious herb, Samdhanakarani (4)."
Hearing those words, Hanuma, having sprung to Mount Oushadhi, could not identify
those precious herbs and became thoughtful.
The following thought arose to that Hanuma, whose strength was unlimited: "I will go
back, taking this mountain-peak itself."
"By conjecture, I understand that the delightful herb must have sprouted in this
mountain-peak. Sushena indeed has said so."
"If I go without taking Vishalyakarani, harm may come through passage of time and a
great perplexity may arise."
Thinking thus, the mighty Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, having gone quickly and
approaching that excellent mountain, taking that mountain-peak with his arms, shaking it violently
for three times and uprooting the mountain-peak, which was endowed with many trees in bloom, lifted
it up, so mighty as he was.
Taking that mountain-peak, which looked like a dark rainy cloud, that Hanuman jumped
up into the sky.
Arriving with a great speed, Hanuma putting down the mountain-peak and resting for a
while, spoke the following words to Sushena:
"O the excellent of monkeys! I have brought the entire mountain-peak, as I could not
identify those herbs."
Eulogizing Hanuma, who was thus narrating his trip, Sushena, the excellent of
monkeys, pulling out the herbs, took hold off them.
All those monkey-chiefs and even the gods were surprised to see that most difficult
feat of Hanuma.
Then, crushign that herb, Sushena the excellent of monkeys, having a great
splendour, administered it through Lakshmana's nose.
Duly inhaling it well, that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries, having the
spear lodged in his body, raised quickly from the earth's surface rid as he was of the spear and
his pain.
Seeing that Lakshmana risen from the ground, the mokneys were overjoyed and
applauded Lakshmana, saying, "Excellent, excellent!".
Rama, the destroyer of enemies, said to Lakshmana, "come, come!" and embraced him
firmly with affection, with his eyes clouded with tears.
After embracing Lakshmana, Rama then said to him: "Luckily, O valiant one, I see you
here, returned from death."
"There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If you
have attained demise, tell me what significnace is there for it to me?"
While the great souled Rama was speaking thus, the exhausted Lakshmana, in a feeble
tone, spoke the following words:
"Having solemnly taken that pledge (of killing Ravana) before, O brother true to
your promise, you ought not to speak as you have done like a weak and courageless man."
"There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If you
have attained demise, tell me what significance is there for it to me?"
"O the faultless one! Getting into homelessness for my sake is not befitting of you.
Fulfill your promise now, by killing Ravana."
"An enemy who falls victim to your arrows, cannot turn out alive, as a huge elephant
which gets into the path of a roaring lion possessing terrible tusks."
"I, for my part, wish to see the death of this evil-minded fellow instantly, even
before this sun, having finished his task, does not sink below the horizon."
"O venerable hero! If you wish to kill Ravana in battle, if you wish to fulfill your
promise and if you feel affectionate towards Seetha, do as I tell you soon and now."That Hanuma, best among monkeys, the intellectual son of Vayu, one with great might, stood on the 
mountain called Lamba with its high peaks equalling a high cloud, gathered courage and entered at night the city 
of Lanka ruled by Ravana and filled with beautiful forests and places of water such as lakes.
The city of Lanka was shone by buildings equalling autumnal clouds. With a sound resembling that 
of an ocean, it was served by ocean breeze. It was filled with well-fed and mighty armies like Vitapati, the capital 
of Kubera. It had elephants positioned at archways and had white gates and archways.
Quickly approaching that city of Lanka which was protected by Rakshasas, like the auspicious 
City of Bhogavati being protected by serpents moving about, spread with cloud illumined by flashes of lightning, 
served by pathways of stars, with light breeze like Indra's city of Amaravati, surrounded by a wall with 
a golden hue, decorated by flags with sounds from groups of small bells. He became happy and leaped up the wall.
Seeing the city everywhere Hanuma became surprised at heart. Thereafter Hanuma the monkey became 
happy seeing the doors which were of golden color, with platforms of cat's eye gems, inlaid with diamonds, crystals 
and pearls, embellished with floors of gems, graced with elephants made of refined gold, crowned with spotless 
white silver, stairs studded with cat's eye gems, with inside walls made of crystal free from dust, provided with 
lovely assembly halls, with sounds of Krauncha birds and peacocks, served by royal swans, looking as though flying 
toward the sky, with auspicious houses resounding everywhere with the sounds of clarionets and ornaments, equalling 
the city of Vasvaukasaara, as though flying towards the sky.
Seeing that city of Ravana, which was the best among cities, a wealthy city, a beautiful and auspicious 
City, that powerful Hanuma thought thus.
"It is not possible for anyone else to oppose this city, by strength alone, which is being guarded 
by armies of Ravana with raised weapons."
This land may be conquerable by Kumuda or Angada, to the great monkey Sushena or Mainda or Dvivida.
There may be access to this land to the son of Sun God Sugreeva, to the monkey Kusaparvana, to 
the chief among monkeys Riksha and me.
Considering the long-armed Sri Rama's strength and Lakshmana's valor, Hanuma became happy.
That great monkey saw that city of the king of rakshasas like a wealthy woman decorated with diamonds 
for her clothes, with various storage houses as earrings, with armories for her breasts. Due to the lamps that 
illuminated the radiant great houses, all darkness was lost.
Thereafter, the guardian of that city, in her form, saw Hanuma, the best among monkeys and 
the mighty one, entering.
Seeing that best among monkeys Hanuma there, that Lanka ruled by Ravana, rose herself with a 
horrific appearance of face and eyes.
She stood in front of the best among Vanaras Hanuma. She made a great sound and spoke to Hanuma 
thus.
"O one who lives in gardens! Who are you? For what reason did you come here? As long as your lives 
are sustained, tell me the truth here before that."
"O Vanara! It is indeed not possible for you to enter this city of Lanka which is protected by 
Ravana's forces and strongly guarded all around."
Thereafter the mighty Hanuma spoke to Lanka standing in front of Him as follows: "Whatever matter 
you are asking me, I will tell you that truthfully."
"You are standing at the entrance to the city. O one with ugly eyes! Who are you? Oh horrible one! 
Stopping me, for what reason are you threatening me?"
Listening to Hanuma's words, Lanka, with the ability to achieve the desired form, became angry and 
spoke these strong words to Hanuma.
"I protect this city, being invincible. I wait for the orders of the king of demons Ravana, the 
great one."
"After humiliating me it is not possible for you to enter the city. Being beaten by me, you will 
leave life and have a permanent sleep."
"O Vanara! I am protecting this city of Lanka in all directions. This matter has been already told 
to you by me."
The son of Vayu and best among Vanaras heard Lanka's words and stood up like a second mountain, 
with a purpose.
Thereafter Hanuma the wise one, with great strength, best among those who can fly and the best 
among Vanaras, saw that city of Lanka in the form of an ugly woman and spoke thus.
"I would like to see the city of Lanka with its palaces, defensive walls, and archways. I came 
here for that reason. I am very curious to see them."
"My arrival here is indeed to see Lanka's gardens, parks, forests, and important houses all over."
Listening to Hanuma's words, Lanka with the ability to assume desired form, spoke harsh words stronger 
than before.
"O lowly Vanara with an evil mind! You can't see this city ruled by the king of 
rakshasas, without first defeating me."
Then that tiger among Vanaras Hanuma spoke to that demon: "O auspicious one! After seeing this 
city I will return to where I came from."
Thereafter Lanka made a great sound causing terror and hit Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, 
with her palm quickly.
Then that tiger among Vanaras, the powerful son of Vayu, being hit powerfully by Lanka made a great 
sound.
Thereafter Hanuma became dizzy with anger and folded his fingers of his left hand. He then hit 
her with His fist. "She is a woman" - thinking thus He did not show much anger by Himself.
That demon fell on land immediately by hit with a distressed body and appeared with a horrific 
face.
Thereafter the intellectual and glorious Hanuma saw her fall and thought her to be a woman, 
showed kindness.
After that Lanka being very gloomy spoke with a faltering tone without pride these words 
to Hanuma the Vanara.
"O long-armed one! O best among Vanaras! Get propitiated and protect me. O gentle one! Those with 
great strength and courage always stand firm on tradition."
"O Vanara! I am myself in the city of Lanka. O strong one! O courageous one! I am defeated by your 
strength."
"O lord of Vanaras! In earlier times I had been given a boon by Lord Brahma. Hear from me about 
this matter."
"Let this be known by you - whenever a Vanara conquers you with his might, then fear will come 
for Rakshasas."
"O gentle one! With your appearance now, that time has come for me. The ordinance of Brahma is the 
truth and is immutable."
"The destruction has come for Ravana the evil-minded king and to all Rakshasas due to Seetha."
"O best aming Vanaras! For that reason, enter the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and do here whatever 
tasks you want to."
"O lord of Vanaras! Enter the auspicious city of Lanka stuck by the curse, ruled by the king of 
Rakshasas, roam everywhere and search for the chaste wife Seetha according to your comfort.Hearing the words of that high-souled Hanuma, Seetha who resembled the daughter of god, 
spoke the following words beneficial to herself.
"O Hanuma! Seeing you speaking pleasant words, I am as overjoyed, as a field with half-sprouted 
crop of grain is thrilled by receiving a rain."
"With my limbs emaciated with grief, I have the desire to touch that Rama the tiger among 
men. Show mercy on me and fulfill my desire."
"O Hanuma the excellent one among the troops of monkeys! Present the story of the blade 
of grass called Ishika hurled with anger and thereby one eye of the crow was destroyed by Rama (as a signal 
remembrance)."
"O Rama! You ought surely to recollect that while a mark on my forehead had got effaced 
once, another mark with realgar was indeed painted by you on the side of my cheek."
"How are you, the valiant man equal to Indra the Lord of celestials, and Varuna the King 
of Universe, ignoring Seetha who was taken away and now staying amid these demons?"
"O faultless Rama! This wonderful jewel for the head has been protected well by 
me. Seeing this in my distress, I have been getting delighted, as though I have seen you."
"This splendid jewel, produced in water, has been sent to you. Absorbed in grief, I shall 
not be able to survive henceforth."
"With hope of your coming here at any time, I am enduring these unbearable hardships 
and also the words of horrible female demons; which pierce my heart."
"O Rama the prince, the annihilator of enemies! I shall hold my life only for a month. 
I will not survive without you, after a month."
"This Ravana, the king of demons, is terrible. In my instance, his glance is not pleasant. 
Hearing that you are causing a delay, I will not survive even for a moment."
Hearing the words of Seetha, spoken pitiably with tears, Hanuma the son of wind-god, 
with great splendor, spoke (as follows):
"O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown averse to everything else, caused by grief towards 
you. I am sending it to you truly. when Rama is overpowered by grief, Lakshmana too gets tormented with grief." 
"O lady! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not the time to lament. You will 
see the end of your sorrow shortly." "Those two princes, the excellent among men, the annihilator of 
enemies and who are eager to see you, will surely reduce Lanka to ashes. "O large-eyed Seetha! Killing 
the cruel Ravana along with his relatives, Rama and Lakshmana will take you to their city."
"O faultless Seetha! Be pleased to give another token of remembrance, which Rama will 
recognize and which creates pleasure to him."
Seetha said, " An excellent token of remembrance was indeed given by me. Seeing this 
jewel for my hair, Rama will trust your words."
Taking that excellent jewel, the illustrious Hanuma, the best among monkeys, offered 
a salutation to Seetha by bowing his head and set off to go.
Seeing that Hanuma, the best among monkeys, possessed of energy to jump up with great 
speed and expand, Seetha spoke (as follows) in her voice choked with tears and looking miserable 
in her face filled with tears.
"O Hanuma! Enquire about the welfare of Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers look like 
lions, of Sugreeva together with his ministers and of all others."
"Be pleased to make that long-armed Rama deliver me from this ocean of sorrow."
"O valiant monkey! After approaching Rama, appraise him of this terrific gush of my grief 
and also about the threatening attitude of these female-demons. Have a happy journey!"
Having been appraised of the matter by Seetha the princess, having accomplished his object, 
having his mind filled with joy and having perceived that only a little remained to be done, Hanuma 
intellectually sought the northern direction.Hanuma, the leader of the monkeys, then neared and slowly consoled Tara who had fallen to the ground like a 
star from the sky. 
"Living beings on doing the deeds of merit or demerit, or knowingly or unknowingly, will derive the 
resultant fruits of those deeds according to one's destiny even after demise, and they shall bear 
them unrepentantly, may they be provident or improvident... 
"Of which lamentable one you lament while you are in a lamentable state? Of which pitiable 
one do you take pity while you are in a pitiable condition? Who is pitiable by whom in these bubbles-like bodies? "You are the one with a living son, and you have to look after this young one Angada, and you have to 
think of the forthcoming activities for his well-being and his performance of duty towards his father. 

"You are aware that the coming and going of beings, in their subtle forms of earth, water, fire, air, and space into this mortal life and back is uncertain, thereby the prudent ones have to perform auspicious 
worldly deeds here in this world, say, the funeral of Vali. "In whom hundreds and thousands of monkeys are harbored and astir, for they have reposed their confidence 
in him alone, that Vali has arrived at his end. "By which reason this Vali conducted himself judiciously, observing friendliness, courteousness, and 
forgivingness, by that reason alone Vali is going to a domain in heavens which he righteously conquered 
for himself, and it is unapt of your sorrowing for him. "All the tigers-monkeys, oh, impeccable Tara, including this son of yours Angada, and all the lords 
of monkeys and bears have their guardian angel in you. 
"Oh, lady, inspirit these two, Sugreeva and Angada, that are searing in grief, and if you acquiesce 
then this Angada will rule over the earth. "Whatever duty anticipated from a male descendent towards his father, and whatever activity that is 
to be done presently in respect of the dying king, let them be done, and that would be a timely decision. 

"Cremation of the king of monkeys and anointment of Angada is the present time affairs, and seeing 
your son invested on the throne you can obtain peace." Thus spoke Hanuma to Tara. On hearing Hanuma's words she is tormented by the plight of her husband, and Tara replies to Hanuma 
who is standing nearby. "Let there be a hundred selfsame Angada-s on one side, and this brave one the other, for me embracing 
him who is put to death is the best .... "Who am I either for conducting the monkey's kingdom or to anoint Angada when Angada's paternal uncle 
Sugreeva is close at hand? 
"Hanuma, this thinking of yours that Angada is to be crowned is untenable, oh, best monkey, the father 
is the real defender of a son, but not the mother."Indeed there is nothing highly befitting to me, either in this world or in the other, than the auspices 
of the king of monkeys, and now to me, the only befitting thing is to join in this brave one on this 
death bed, which he is adoring when put to death while he is facing away. The great Hanuma then removed that thought with the right mind and had another thought 
about Seetha.
Seetha is not suitable to sleep separated from Rama, will not eat, will not decorate also, 
not suited to drink a beverage, to reach another man even if he were Indra because there is indeed no one 
equaling Rama even among gods. This is another woman - thus deciding that Hanuma paced in that banqueting hall.
Some women were tired from erotic dalliance and then some other women were tired from singing; 
some others were weary from dance and were unconscious from the consumption of liquor.
Some women were stationed on tabors, on Mrudangas, on seats, and some other women rested on chief carpets.
The warrior among Vanaras saw a thousand women decorated with jewelry with a nature of talking 
about beauty, conversing about the correct meaning of songs being sung, behaving according to time and place, 
wont to speak appropriate words, indulged in sleep after sexual dalliance.
In the middle of that group of women, Ravana with great arms shone like a bull in the middle of 
cows in a big cow pen.
That Ravana himself surrounded by those women, shone like a great elephant surrounded by the elephants 
in a great forest.
The best among Vanaras saw in that wealthy Ravana's house a bar also, consisting of all desirables.
Hanuma saw there in that bar, the meat of dear and buffalo, of wild boar kept separately.
The best among Vanaras saw half-eaten peacocks and chicken in wide vessels of golden color.
Hanuma observed the meat of pigs and goats, porcupines, deer, and peacocks preserved in curds and sochal 
salt.
Hanuma saw birds called Krakara cooked ready to be eaten in a variety of ways, birds called Chakras 
half-eaten, wild buffalos, fishes called kashaya, goats, food to be licked of various kinds, beverages, and various 
foods.
In the same way that floor was obtaining glory greatly with Ragas and Shadabas seasoned with sour 
and salty sauces, with necklaces, anklets, and armlets of great value thrown around, with various fruits left in 
drinking vessels, with flowers sprinkled.
That bar was seen as though radiant without fire, with couches and chairs well arranged and placed 
here and there.
Many meats of different kinds cultured with various best seasonings, well arranged separately obtained 
that bar.
Excellent and clear various liquors, a liquor called Sura, liquor made of sugar, liquor made of 
honey, a liquor made of flowers, and liquors made of fruits also, artificially made liquors - those and those were 
cultured separately with various fragrant powders.
The floor shone filled with flower garlands in a variety of forms, with various vessels of golden 
hue and also made of crystal, filled with other small vessels of golden color.
Hanuma saw indeed then lot of best quality liquor in pots of silver and golden colour.
That great Hanuma saw vessels full of liquor of golden color, embedded with gemstones and also 
of silver hue.
That Hanuma saw indeed at some places drinks half filled and completely drunk and 
some places are not at all drunk.
Hanuma paced about seeing at some places various eatables and at some places drinks separately, 
and at some places remnants of cooked rice.
Hanuma saw some places with vessels broken, some places with pots in shambles, some places with 
water together with flower garlands and fruits.
Here couches again of women were varied and clean, some best women slept there hugging one another.
Some women conquered by the power of sleep pulled other sleeping women's clothing and slept covering 
themselves.
Clothing and garland on the throats of those women were moving slightly and wonderfully as though 
obtaining air from the air of breath.
The wind blew carrying in a lot of directions, a variety of fragrances of cool sandal paste and 
of sweet liquor, of various flower garlands, and various kinds of agallocum fumes.
Then the blossoming fragrance from the baths and sandal paste and from agal locum fumes blew spreading 
all around in that Pushpaka plane.
There in Ravana's house, some women had fair and white complexion some best women were black, 
some women had a body of golden complexion.
The appearance of those sleeping women, tired from being possessed by sleep and from lust, was like 
lotuses sleeping.
Hanuma with great radiance thus saw entire Ravana's house completely but did not see Seetha.
Then Hanuma seeing those women obtained great anguish and was in doubt because of fear in the 
matter of dharma.
"My seeing sleeping house of other people's wives will do a great deficit to dharma."
"My sight is indeed not in the matter of other wives here. These other wives have been seen by 
me."
To that Hanuma with an excellent mind, with a fixed and concentrated mind, was born another thought 
again, showing a fixed resolve in the task at hand.
"All Ravana's women who were in faith could have been seen by me; to my mind there indeed was not 
even a little disturbance".
"Among auspicious or inauspicious states in the behavior of all senses mind is the reason. My that 
mind is very steady."
"By me, it is not possible to search Seetha at another place. Always during the search women will be 
seen among other women."
"To an animal of whatever race that animal is searched in that race; a woman missing is not possible 
to be searched among female deer."
"For that reason, all this Ravana's house has been searching by me with a pure mind Seetha alone cannot 
be seen."
The strong Hanuma observing girls from devas, Gandharvas, and girls from nagas did not see Janaki.
The powerful Hanuma not seeing Her there and seeing other best women then started to think deeply 
going far from there.
That Hanuma the glorious one adopting a great task again left that bar and began to search for that 
house.Keeping Angada the prince in their forefront those monkeys, on reaching Mount Prasravana 
having forests of variegated appearance, offered their salutation by bowing their heads in reverence 
to Rama and the mighty Lakshmana, greeting Sugreeva respectfully. Then, they started narrating the news 
of Seetha.
Those monkeys started to narrate, in the presence of Rama, about, the female demons, 
and frightening Seetha in Ravana's gynoecium, her complete affection towards Rama, and the time limit 
of two months given by Ravana.
Hearing of Seetha being alive, Rama on his part replied, "Where is Seetha, the princess? 
How is she disposed towards me? O monkeys! Tell me all that about Seetha."
Hearing the words of Rama, the monkeys urged Hanuma to tell, in the presence of Rama, 
all the incidents because he knew them better, about Seetha.
Hearing the words of those monkeys, the eloquent Hanuma, the son of the wind-god saluted 
towards the direction of Seetha the princess by bowing his head, spoke the following words, explaining 
how he saw Seetha.
"Having gone across the ocean, a hundred Yojanas wide, I reached the southern shore looking 
in search of Seetha, Janaka's daughter, with a wish to see her."
"There at the southern shore of the southern ocean, there is a city called Lanka of the 
evil-minded Ravana."
"O Rama! There, living in Ravana's gynaecium in the city, I saw the lady Seetha, your 
virtuous wife, centering her heart's desire in you."
"In that pleasure garden, I saw Seetha sitting amid female demons, guarded 
by those ugly-faced female demons as also time and again being threatened by them."
"O hero! Seetha, who deserves to live happily with you, is obtaining grief. O Rama! I 
somehow searched that princess, Seetha wearing a single plait (as a mark of desolation), looking 
miserable, remaining absorbed in your thoughts, reposing on the floor, having discolored limbs like 
a lotus in winter, turning back the wish from Ravana, having determined to die, but thinking of you 
alone."
"O faultless tiger among men! Seetha established confidence in me after I slowly described 
to her the fame of the Ikshvaku dynasty."
"Thereafter, I spoke and explained to Seetha, about the entire significance of my arrival 
there. On hearing about the alliance between Rama and Sugreeva, she was quite pleased. Her morality 
as well as her devotion to you are steadfast."
"O, the foremost of men! I thus saw that illustrious Seetha, endowed with severe penance 
and devotion towards you."
"O Rama, of great intelligence! To me, she gave as a token of remembrance, a previous 
event of a crow occurred in your vicinity in Mount Chitrakuta."
"Seetha spoke to me saying, 'O Hanuma! Inform Rama, the foremost among men, all that 
you have seen here."
"While Sugreeva is hearing nearby and while you are telling the words in this way, let 
this jewel, which is deliberately well-guarded, be given to Rama."
"This beautiful jewel for the head has been well-guarded by me. You also ought to recall 
a mark indeed painted by you (by slip) on the curve of my cheek with powder of an orange-red rock, when 
my former mark on my forehead got effaced."
"This beautiful jewel, which has its origin in sea water, has been sent to you. Seeing 
this in my grief, I am feeling always happy as though I am seeing you."
"O Rama! I shall be sustaining my life for a month. Having come into the control of demons, 
I cannot survive beyond one month."
"Seetha, with her emaciated body, practicing virtue, confined in Ravana's gynoecium and 
with her wide-open eyes like that of a doe, spoke to me the following words:
"O Rama! I have narrated to you whatever has occurred, in its entirety. Let a bridge 
be constructed, by all means, across the waters of the ocean."
Coming to know that the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana have become confident and having 
given that token of remembrance to Rama, Hanuman apprised completely in so many words, in regular succession, 
all that was conveyed by Seetha, the princess."O excellent among men! Having shown respect for me out of her affection and good-heartedness 
for you, I, who was in a haste to go, was spoken to again by Seetha the princess about the further course 
of action."
"Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is to be informed by you thus in several ways, for quickly 
killing Ravana in battle and also as to how he can get me back."
" 'O hero the annihilator of enemies! If you deem it fit, stay for a day in a secret 
place. You can go tomorrow after taking a rest'."
"'O the valiant one! Because of your presence, the termination of my full-blown grief 
may continue for a while."
"'When you, the courageous one, have left to come back, there will be a danger 
even to my life. There is no doubt about this."
"'The sorrow born of your disappearance will further torment me, who is overtaken by 
one sorrow after another, miserable and doomed to grief as I am."
"'O best among the monkeys! O valiant one! In the matter of monkeys and bears who are 
your helpmates, this very grave doubt stands before me."
"'How indeed can those troops of monkeys and bears or Rama and Lakshmana cross that 
great insurmountable ocean?'"
"'Three beings viz. Garuda the eagle, or yourself or the wind god only have the capacity 
of crossing this ocean."
"'O valiant monkey! That is why, what strategy are you visualizing to fulfill this act, 
which is so difficult to accomplish? You are indeed excellent of those who know how to accomplish 
any work'."
"O Hanuma the annihilator of hostile enemies! You, as one alone, are capable of fulfilling 
this task. Your act of fulfilling this task your act of fulfilling the result is well-known."
""It would result in his glory, if Rama, after killing Ravana along with his entire army, 
takes me to his city in his victory'."
"'Rama ought not to take me back for fear that Ravana, in the same manner as Ravana the 
demon took me away from the forest in the absence of Rama by cheating that heroic Rama."
If Rama, the destroyer of the rival army, fills the entire Lanka with arrows and takes me 
home, it will be quite worthy of him."
"For that reason, you act in such a way, that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, 
exhibits the prowess befitting of him."
"Hearing that appeal (of Seetha), which was somewhat good in its meaning, courteous and 
duly furnished with reasons, I gave them my remaining reply (as follows):
"'O Seetha the princess! Sugreeva, the lord of the troops of monkeys and bears, excellent 
among the monkeys and endowed with strength, is firmly determined to rescue you."
"So many monkeys, endowed with prowess, perseverance great strength, and who can rush 
to any place as they wish, are intensely committed to Sugreeva's command. There is no hindrance to their 
movement either in the sky or the ground or in a horizontal region between the sky and the ground. Those 
monkeys with unlimited splendor are not indolent in performing any great task."
"Those illustrious monkeys, proud of their strength and following the path of wind, circumambulated 
the entire earth several times."
"'In them, some of the monkeys are superior to me and some are even equal to me. No one 
in the vicinity of Sugreeva is inferior to me. When I have arrived here, why to talk about those mighty 
ones? Generally, superior ones are not sent for errands. Only others are indeed sent."
"'O Seetha the princess! Enough of your lamentation. Take away your sorrow. Those leaders 
of monkeys will reach Lanka by one single leap'."
"Rama and Lakshmana, those two lions among men, also of great strength, ascending on 
my shoulders can come to you, like the rising sun and the moon."
"Rama, the annihilator of enemies, similar to a lion, and Lakshmana wielding a bow in 
his hand, will surely approach the entrance gate of Lanka and you will see them soon."
"'You can see soon those valiant monkeys, with their claws and tusks as weapons, having 
the prowess of lions and tigers and looking like lordly elephants, coming here together'."
"'You will hear within a short time, the clamor of the excellent of monkeys resonating 
like mountains and clouds, on the peaks of Mount Malaya in Lanka'."
"'You will see Rama, the annihilator of enemies, returning from exile, and getting anointed 
to the crown in Ayodhya, along with you soon."
"Thereafter, smoothened by me with comforting, well-disposed, and agreeable words, Seetha, 
though tormented with the thought of your grief, obtained peace of mind."That Ravana, the long-armed, who caused people to cry, looking up at that monkey standing 
in front of him, was affected with violent anger, having his mind seized with suspicion, speculated 
(as follows) about Hanuma, the jewel among the monkeys, who was invested with splendour.
"When Mount Kailasa was moved by me, is it the same Nandi the divine bull (attendant 
of Siva) which cursed me long ago and came here now in this form or whether he is Bana the great demon 
(son of Bali) came here in the form of a monkey."
King Ravana, becoming enraged with red-hot eyes, spoke the following concise and 
meaningful words relevant to that occasion, to Prahasta, his chief of ministers.
"Ask this wicked monkey from where he came, for what reason he come to this place 
and for what purpose did he frighten the female demons into destroying our garden."
"Ask this evil-minded monkey as to what is his purpose in coming over to my invincible 
City and what pursuit he is doing this battle."
Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta spoke the following words to Hanuma, "Take courage! 
Happiness to you! You need not get frightened, O monkey!"
"O monkey! If Indra has sent you to the abode of Ravana, tell me the truth. Do not have 
fear. You will be released."
"Are you, the one who has entered our city, assuming the guise of a spy, sent by Kubera 
the god of riches or by Yama the god of death or by Varuna the lord of the sea or whether sent by Vishnu 
the lord of preservation, as a messenger, longing for a victory?"
"O monkey! Your form alone is that of a monkey. Your splendour indeed is not that of 
a monkey. Now, tell me the truth. Thereupon, you will be released."
"If you tell a lie, your survival will be difficult. Or else, tell me the purpose of 
your entry into Ravana's abode."
Hearing the words of Prahasta, Hanuma spoke to Ravana the Lord of demons as follows, 
"I am not a messenger of Indra or Yama or Varuna. I have no friendship with Kubera the god of riches, 
nor am I instigated by Vishnu. This is just my form of existence, from my very birth. I am a monkey who 
came here."
"The sight of Ravana the King of demons is difficult to obtain. Intent on that object 
(of sight of Ravana), the garden was destroyed by me."
"Then, those strong demons came with a desire to fight with me. Just to protect my 
body, I had to attack them in battle."
"I am incapable of being bound by missiles and nooses even by celestials and demons. 
This boon came to me also from Brahama only."
With a desire to see you the king, I surrendered to the missile. Soon after bound by 
the demons, I was indeed released from the missile. I came to your presence, prompted by some mission 
of Rama."
"O, Lord of demons! Know me to be a messenger of Rama who is possessing I am unlimited 
splendour. I am telling you a beneficial word. Listen to it."After informing all this, Hanuma the son of the wind-god started telling more of the following 
words.
"By the power of virtuousness of Seetha, Rama's effort and Sugreeva's zeal are getting 
fulfilled. My mind too is devoted to her."
"Ravana, the king of demons, who is strong in all ways, can burn away the three worlds 
by the power of his penance. Even if he is enraged, he can scorch away his adversaries."
"His body, which touched Seetha the daughter of Janaka, was not destroyed because of 
his askesis. Even a flame, when fully touched with one's hand, cannot do that which Seetha would, if 
stirred by anger."
"This work (of mine in the form of Seetha's discovery) has been informed to you in this 
way. It is indeed proper to see those two princes (Rama and Lakshmana) along with Seetha, after taking 
permission from all the great monkeys headed by Jambavan.
"I am sufficient, even alone; to destroy rapidly that City of Lanka together with those 
troops of demons as also the mighty Ravana."
"When accompanied by you, who are strong, whose spirit is disciplined, who are proficient 
in the use of arms, valiant, longing for victory and moving by jumps, how much more is required?"
"In the battle, I on my part will kill Ravana along with his army, his forerunners, his 
sons, and his brothers."
"In the battle, I can blow out the missiles presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, 
Brahma the creator, Rudra the god of destruction, Vayu the wind god, Varuna the god of water, and even 
those missiles even if they are difficult to be looked at, employed by Indrajit (Ravana's eldest son).
"My prowess, when permitted by you, will frustrate that Ravana. The shower of rocks, 
which will be unequaled and incessant, discharged by me, can kill even celestials. How much more those 
demons?"
"The ocean may overflow its shore. Mount Mandara may move from its position. But, in 
battle, no army of adversaries can stagger Jambavan."
"The heroic Angada, the son of Vali alone, is sufficient to destroy all the troops of 
demons and even the demons who were their progenitors."
"By the rapid movement of the thighs of the high-souled Neela and of Panasa, even Mount 
Mandara can be shattered. How much more, the demons in battle?"
"Tell me anyone who can fight against Mainda or Dvivida, among Gandharvas the celestial 
singers or Uragas the serpents or Pakshis the birds or the celestials or the demons or Yakshas the semi-divine 
beings."
"These two illustrious sons of Ashvini Kumaras, Mainda, and Dvivida are the foremost among 
the monkeys. In the battle-field, I do not find anyone who can fight against these two monkeys."
"Proud of having received boons from Brahma the creator and their grandfather and abiding 
in a supreme haughtiness, these two foremost among all the monkeys live on Amrita the nectar."
"Long ago, Brahma the grandfather of all the worlds gave an unequal boon to them in honor 
of Ashvini Kumaras regarding their inviolability."
"By the pride of those boons, those two heroic monkeys harassed a great army of celestials 
and thereupon drank up nectar, excited as they were with joy."
"Let all the other monkeys stand aside. Even these Mainda and Dvivida on their part are 
capable of destroying the entire city of Lanka together with its horses, chariots, and elephants."
"I alone burnt and destroyed the City of Lanka. In all its royal high-ways, the name 
(of Rama and others) was proclaimed by me as follows:
"'Victorious is Rama, the exceedingly strong and the mighty Lakshmana too! Victorious 
is King Sugreeva, protected by Rama. I am Hanuma, a servant of Rama and the son of the wind god. In this 
way, the name (of Rama and others) was heralded by me everywhere."
"Amid Ashoka garden of the evil-minded Ravana and underneath a Shimshupa tree, 
the virtuous Seetha was seen staying dejected, encircled as she was with female demons, agonized with 
grief and anguish, lusterless like a digit of the moon encircled by a line of clouds and disregarding 
that Ravana who is arrogant of his strength."
"Seetha, a devoted and virtuous wife, having charming hips, has been placed under restraint. 
The auspicious Seetha is devoted to Rama in all ways, giving her undivided thought to Rama like Shachi 
the goddess, giving her concern to Indra the destroyer of strongholds."
"Weaving that single piece of cloth, which she had on her person even while being borne 
away by Ravana, and likewise covered with dust, she was seen by me in a miserable condition with her 
grief and anguish, devoted as she was to the welfare of her husband."
"I saw Seetha in a royal pleasure garden, amidst some female demons. Seetha was being 
frightened time and again by those ugly female demons. Seetha, wearing a single braid of hair and 
looking depressed, was fully engaged in thinking about her lord. Looking like a lotus with a discolored 
figure in winter, she had determined to die, utterly averting to do anything with Ravana."
"With great difficulty, I created confidence in that fawn-eyed Seetha. Thereafter, I 
talked to her and explained everything to her. She was delighted to hear the companionship cropped up 
between Rama and Sugreeva."
"That high-souled Seetha does not kill Ravana who has committed an offense because she 
conducts herself well with restraint and since supreme is her devotion to her lord."
"Rama, on his part, will become a mere instrument in killing that Ravana. Seetha, 
who is by her nature, on delicate-limbed woman, was emaciated because of separation from her lord. 
She had grown thin like the learning of a scholar continuing his studies even on the first day of lunar 
fortnight (which must be observed as a complete holiday by students."
"Thus, the illustrious Seetha remains immersed in grief. Let all that be done, which 
requires to be counteracted by way of a relief in this matter."Seeing the city of Lanka blazing, and frightened with its multitude of demons getting 
alarmed, Hanuma the monkey became thoughtful.
A great anxiety entered his mind and there arose in him a feeling of self-contempt. He 
said to himself "What an admonitory act has been done by me in burning Lanka."
"As a burning fire is extinguished with water, blessed indeed are those great-souled 
men of excellence, who in their wisdom, restrain their elevated fury."
"Which enraged man would not incur a sinful act? An enraged person may even kill his 
elders. An enraged person may insult virtuous men with harsh words."
"An agitated person ever does not know which appropriate words are and which are forbidden 
words to be uttered. For enraged persons, there is neither an improper act nor ever an improper word 
to be spoken."
"As a serpent casts off its slough, whoever casts aside an intense anger sprung up in 
him suddenly by his endurance, he verily is said to be an excellent man."
"Shame be upon me, the greatest sinner with utter foolishness and impudence, who became 
a fire-brand without giving thought to that Seetha and became hurtful to my master."
"If this whole Lanka for its part has been burnt, the worshipful Seetha too has surely 
been burnt. Thus, I have spoilt the purpose of my lord inadvertently."
"That purpose for which all this effort was taken, has been spoilt. At the time of burning 
the city, I have not saved Seetha indeed."
"This task (of burning Lanka) has been fulfilled by me and it has been completed only 
with a small effort. Overpowered as I was with anger, the very root of that fulfillment has been destroyed 
by me. There is no doubt."
"The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore, 
Seetha also must have been surely lost."
"If this task has been spoiled due to my perverted intelligence, it is appropriate even 
for me, here and now itself, to give up my life."
"Shall I jump into the fire now or into the mouth of a submarine fire? Or shall I give up 
my body as a feed to the marine animals?"
"By me who has ruined the entire task, how can I, even while remaining alive, see Sugreeva 
the Lord of Monkeys or Rama and Lakshmana the best of men?"
"Due to culpability of my anger, I have indeed shown this apishness that is famous for 
instability in the three worlds."
"Let there be a shame upon the passionate way of my thinking, which breeds helplessness 
and instability. fir, even though capable as I am, Seetha could not be saved by me due to my exciting 
passion of anger."
"If Seetha dies, those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana will die. If their death occurs, 
Sugreeva along with his associates will also die."
"How can the virtuous Bharata together with Shatrughna, who is affectionate to his brother, 
survive after hearing this news?"
"When the virtuous Ikshvaku dynasty perishes, all the people will undoubtedly be tormented 
with anguish and affliction."
"Therefore, I, the unfortunate being, deprived of the values of duty and interest, with 
my mind filled with culpability of anger, clearly became the destroyer of the world."
While thinking thus, Hanuma saw some omens, whose welcome results had already 
been directly experienced by him and again thought (as follows);
"Or else, Seetha the auspicious lady, who is completely charming of her limbs and protected 
by her effulgence, does not get destroyed. Fire does not indeed destroy fire!"
"If this fire with its burning nature is not igniting me, it is surely due to the power 
of Rama and the benevolence of Seetha."
"How should that Seetha, who is a godhead for the three brothers (of Rama) starting with 
Bharata and who is dear to the heart of Rama perish?"
"This fire, which spreads everywhere without any hindrance, is not burning my tail. How 
can it burn the venerable Seetha?"
Hanuma then recalled with wonder the sight of Mount Mainaka (having gold in its cavities) 
amid sea water there.
"That Seetha can even burn away the fire by her penance, true utterances, and undivided 
devotion towards her husband. Fire does not ignite her."
Hanuma, who was thus thinking there about the overpowering virtue of Seetha, happened 
to hear the words of the high-souled charanas (heavenly bards).
"Alas! Hanuma, who hurled a very terrific fire into Ravana's house, has indeed done a 
difficult act."
"The city of Lanka, full of demons their wives, children, and elders running hither and 
thither, as also filled with an uproar of people, appears as if it weeping through its mountain-caves."
"It is just so surprising a marvel to us that the entire City with its market-places, 
ramparts, and arched door-ways, was burnt, but Seetha alone was not burnt."
That Hanuma became delighted in his mind, by seeing the omens, with their apparent advantages 
in them and very high qualities of their origin as also the words of those sages.
Then, Hanuma, having fulfilled his object of desire by learning that Seetha the princess 
remains uninjured, made up his mind to return only after seeing her personally yet again.In that house, while observing, Hanuma saw a portion of the house with beds and couches, consisting 
of best couches equaling those in heaven, made of crystal decorated with diamonds, with wonderful parts made of 
ivory and gold, covered with the best beds made of cat's eye gems of great value.
Hanuma saw in a part of that room, an umbrella white in colour decorated with the best flower garlands 
and resembling the moon - the lord of stars.
Hanuma saw an excellent couch made of gold with radiance equaling that of fire, spread by garlands 
of Ashoka flowers.
Fanned by women with fans in their hands in all four directions and obtained by various fragrances 
fumigated by the best incense.
Covered by an excellent bed, spread by sheep skin everywhere, and shone by rows of excellent garlands.
Hanuma saw Ravana in that house, equaling a cloud, wearing earrings with a brilliant shine  
red eyes and long arms wearing gold clothes.
With his body smeared with red sandal-wood with a good fragrance like a cloud in the red sky at sunset, 
together with groups of lightening.
Ravana was filled with excellent jewelry, a good appearance, with an ability to assume the desired 
form, resembling mount Mandara in sleep, together with groups of trees and bushes.
Resting after having pleasure at night, bedecked with the best ornaments, he was a lover to the 
rakshasa girls and causing comfort to rakshasas.
That great Hanuma saw the gallant king of rakshasas sleep on a shining couch resting after drinking.
That Hanuma, best among Vanaras neared Ravana, became very gloomy and moved away with great dread, 
as though from a hissing serpent.
Thereafter the great Hanuma neared the staircase, sought another dais, and observed closely Ravana.
The excellent couch of the sleeping Ravana shone like a great lake when a scented elephant resided 
in it.
That Hanuma also saw the wealthy Ravana's arms tied with golden armlets thrown apart, resembling 
flag staff raised in honor of Indra.
Those arms had wounds made by stabbing from the pointed edges of tusks of Iraavata and fleshy shoulders 
smeared with a diamond and hit by Vishnu chakra.
These arms of Ravana were corpulent with well-grown and equally strong shoulders proportionate to 
body, with knees and thumbs of good characteristics, with good fingers and palms.
With strong joints in the shape of a club, round in shape resembling the trunks of an elephant, like 
five headed snakes were thrown on a clean couch.
Shoulders well smeared by best sandal with good smell and very cool resembling in color to a hare's 
blood, well decorated, massaged by the best women, served by the best sandals and which made yakshas, nagas, Gandharvas, 
devas and daanavaas scream.
That Hanuma saw their arms on the couch like great serpents in anger sleeping in the middle of 
mount Mandara.
That king of Rakshasas equaling a mountain with those shoulders, which were well built and shone 
like Mount Mandara with twin peaks.
From the great face of that king of Rakshasas who was sleeping, came out breath with fragrance 
like that of flowers of chute and punnaaga, consisting of the best fragrance of Vakula flowers, together with 
the flavor of best-cooked rice, with the smell of liquor, as though filling that house.
That Hanuma saw in the house of that king of Rakshasa's, wives at the feet, Ravana being a gigantic 
one with loving wives, shone with crown tilted to the side, having strange hue with pearls and diamonds and of 
golden color, with a face made brilliant by earrings, shone with the chest region smeared with red sandal, shining 
with a necklace wide, high, and corpulent with a silk cloth of white color falling on him, with eyes reddish like 
blood, well tied by the best cloth of yellow color and of the very best quality, resembling a heap of black beans, 
snoring like a hiss of a snake, like an elephant sleeping in the middle of water belonging to the great river 
Ganga with all four directions shone by the four lamps of golden color, resembling a cloud with all the parts 
being shone by groups of lighting.
The leader of Vanaras saw those wives of Ravana with faces with the radiance of the moon, adorned with 
beautiful earrings, wearing jewelry, and flower garlands that were not worn out.
Hanuma saw wives of Ravana with skill in dance and musical instruments, who obtained shoulders 
of Ravana wearing the best jewelry and being sleep.
He saw earrings of those women at the end of ears with embedded diamonds and cat eye gems and 
having golden color.
With the faces of those women with delicate earrings that were equal to the moon and auspicious that 
house shone like the sky with clusters of stars.
Women of that Ravana being tired from lustful passion and exertion and having lean waists slept 
at the first opportunity.
Another woman with skill in dancing consisting of delicate body postures slept in the same way 
with all her body parts making the same dance postures.
One woman hugging veena and sleeping was shining like a lotus plant thrown away by the flow of 
a great river and resorting a boat.
Another woman with black eyes sleeping with an instrument called madduka under the arm pit shone like 
a woman carrying an infant boy with love.
A woman with beautiful body features and beautiful breasts slept tightly and hugged an instrument 
called Pataha as though hugging a lover, getting him after a long time.
Another woman with lotus-like eyes hugging a flute slept like a woman with lust holding her lover 
in secret.
Another woman skilled in dance obtained sleep by getting an instrument like a veena and being in tune 
with it like a woman together with her lover.
Another woman with lusty eyes slept hugging a percussion instrument called mridanga with her body 
parts that were pleasant which resembled gold and which were smooth and fleshy.
Another woman with a thin stomach, who was not to be blamed, slept due to tiresomeness from lust 
together with an instrument called Padama between her shoulders and reaching arm pits.
Another woman with an instrument called Dindima near her slept in the same way as a woman hugging 
her husband and also her child.
Another woman with eyes like lotus petals slept making the instrument called adambara pressing 
it by her shoulders being desired by lust.
Another woman sleeping, felling down a small pot, shone like a flower garland with the flowers 
of strange hue made auspicious in spring.
Another woman slept hugging her breasts resembling golden pots by her hands, overcome with sleep.
Another woman with eyes like lotus petals, with her face resembling a full moon, overcome with lust 
slept hugging another woman with a beautiful hip region.
Some excellent women slept hugging strange instruments and pressing them with their breasts as though 
lustful woman with lusty men.
Hanuma saw among those women a very beautiful woman sleeping on an auspicious couch arranged 
alone at a side.
Hanuma saw Mandodari with a beautiful form together with diamonds and pearls, well decorated by 
jewelry and with her self-radiance as though decorating that great building with a fair complexion and with 
a radiance like golden color, who was dear to her husband the lady of women in that gynaeceum sleeping there.
That Hanuma with great arms seeing the woman well decorated, out of logic thought thus: "This is 
Seetha by the wealth of her appearance and her youth". That warrior of Vanaras was delighted together with great 
pleasure.
He clasped his arms, kissed his tail he was delighted, he was playful, sang, and paced showing his 
simian nature climbed pillars and fell on land.That Hanuma with great resplendence thought for a moment, obtained that Ashoka garden by mind and 
jumped from the compound wall of that house.
That great Hanuma with joyful limbs, being on enclosure wall saw various trees such as Sal, beautiful 
Ashoka, Champaka full of flowers, Uddalaka, Naga, mango trees with their fruit in the colour of the snout of a 
monkey, in full blossom at the start of the spring.
Thereafter Hanuma flew like a Naracha arrow released from bow string, toward the garden covered 
by mango trees and surrounded by hundreds of creepers.
That Hanuma the simian, saw on entering that garden filled with happy humans, animals and birds 
with varied hues during spring, resounded by birds, with trees made of silver, made of gold, surrounded everywhere 
by birds and groups of animals; wonderful with wonderful trees equaling the Sun at sunrise together with trees 
of various kinds which obtained flowers and fruits, served daily by Cuckoos and by dragon flies, resounded by 
peacocks in heat and with groups of birds of various kinds.
Hanuma searching the royal daughter Seetha with excellent limbs and without blame, woke up birds 
in comfortable sleep.
Trees hit by wings of groups of birds in flight shed showers of flowers of various colours and 
of various kinds.
The son of Lord Vayu, Hanuma sprinkled with flowers shone like a mountain of flowers in the middle 
of Ashoka garden.
Seeing Hanuma running in all directions and being in the middle of trees, all living creatures 
thought Him to be Vasanta, the lord of spring.
There the Earth sprinkled by flowers of various kinds which fell down from trees shone like a well 
decorated woman.
Then those trees, shaken by the might of Hanuma the mighty one, showered wonderful flowers.
The trees with their branches, removed leaves with fallen down fruits and flowers were like defeated 
gamblers with their clothes and jewellery kept down.
The excellent trees shining with best flowers fell down instantly flowers, leaves and fruits.
All those trees losing groups of birds became being a resort to branches only like trees shook 
by wind.
Hit by Hanuma's tail, hands and feet, Ashoka garden with broken best trees became like a young 
woman with disturbed hair, with effaced sandal paste, with her auspicious teeth and lips drunk from and wounded 
by nails and by teeth.
Hanuma broke circles of great creepers by His might like the wind during rainy season, breaking 
the groups of clouds of mountain Vindhya.
That Hanuma pacing there saw diamond studded floors, silver inlaid floors, and beautiful gold inlaid 
floors.
Hanuma saw ponds filled with the best waters, together there and there with stairs embedded with 
diamonds of great value, with pearls and corals as sand, with bottoms made of crystal and precious stones, shone 
by trees of golden hue and of wonderful hue at banks containing beds of lotuses in full blossom and lilies, resounded 
by chakravaka birds nearby, sounded by water fowls, resounded by swans and cranes, together with tall trees, with 
nectar like waters, with hundreds of auspicious creepers, covered by the flowers of santaana trees, surrounded 
by various shrubs with middle regions of karaveera and also wells and in various shapes.
Thereafter the monkey warrior Hanuma saw a mountain which was a beautiful mountain in the world, 
equaling cloud with high peaks, with wonderful peaks surrounded in all directions by peaks, spread by caves and 
covered by different trees.
Hanuma saw river which fell down from the mountain like a beloved (young wife) who fell down after 
jumping from the lap of a loved one shone by trees whose ends fell down in water or like a woman in anger being 
detained by her near and dear. That great Hanuma again saw that river with water, turning back like a beloved 
woman reaching her beloved again, being reconciled to her beloved one.
The best among vanaras and the son of Vayu, that Hanuma saw near to that mountain, lotus ponds 
together with many groups of birds.
He also saw an artificial pond filled with cold water, with steps embedded with best diamonds, 
shone by the sand of pearls, wonderful forest with very big buildings made by Vishwakarma, with groups of artificial 
trees decorated in all directions.
There whatever trees were there with flowers and fruits, all those were together with umbrellas, 
together with big platforms and with smaller golden platforms.
The monkey warrior Hanuma saw one shimshupaa tree golden in colour covered with many groups of 
creepers and with many leaves surrounded everywhere with platforms made of gold.
Hanuma saw lands, mountain springs, and some other golden trees equal to fire.
Then the courageous Hanuma thought thus: "Like the sun by the radiance of Mount Meru, by the radiance 
of those trees, I am of golden colour."
Seeing that shimshupaa tree with groups of trees of golden colour blown by the wind, with the sound 
of hundreds of tinkle bells, Hanuma got surprised.
Hanuma with great arms climbing up that shimshupaa tree with well flowered ends, beautiful tree, 
mature with young shoots and leaves and covered by leaves (thought thus).
"I will see by God's grace, Seetha who is interested in the sight of Sri Rama while she is moving 
here and there with grief."
This Ashoka garden of evil-souled Ravana is definitely beautiful; it is well decorated by Champaka 
trees, by sandal trees and by Vakula trees.
"This pond also served by groups of birds is beautiful; that wife of Sri Rama definitely will come 
for this pond."
"The wife of Sri Rama dear to Sri Rama, a chaste wife, soul captivating one, expert at moving in 
forest, that Janaki will definitely come."
"Otherwise one with the eyes of a deer, emaciated by the thought of Sri Rama, that noble one will 
come for this garden."
"Tortured by grief for Sri Rama, with beautiful eyes, interested always living in the garden, that 
Devi moving about in the garden will come."
"The beloved wife of Sri Rama, the daughter of king Janaka, the chaste wife, earlier always was 
interested the denizens of the garden. This is true."
"The ever youthful one with the best complexion, Seetha interested in the rites of Sandhya time 
will definitely come to this river with the auspicious water for Sandhya rite."
"Whoever Seetha, the auspicious wife, a dear one of Sri Rama, the king of kings, to that Seetha 
this Ashoka garden, an auspicious one, is well suited also."
"That Devi with the face like that of the moon, if alive, she definitely will come for this river 
with auspicious water."
The great-souled Hanuma thus thinking being concealed in the mass of well flowered leaves saw everything 
observing everywhere.That Hanuma the best among Vanaras, the great radiant one, the long-armed one,
conquered with His might the best Lanka who is capable of assuming desired form. He then leapt over
the city wall at a place that was not a gate.
Desiring the benefit of the king of Vanaras Sugreeva, Hanuma entered the city
of Lanka and thus actually placed His left foot on the enemies' heads.
That son of Vayu endowed with great strength, entered the city at night and took the
grand road shone by flowers and pearls. After that Hanuma went towards that beautiful city of
Lanka.
The beautiful city shone like the sky together with clouds, with its cloud-like
houses filled with sounds of laughter and with sounds of musical instruments in the interior, equal
in strength to diamonds and clubs and with windows decorated with diamonds.
Then that city of Lanka shone brilliantly being well decorated by the houses of
Rakshasas. These were modern houses which equalled white clouds, which were surprising with the
shape of a lotus and swastika and which were auspicious.
That glorious Hanuma, performer of beneficial deeds for Sugreeva the king of
monkeys, moved around the city of Lanka which had wonderful garlands and jewellery, for the sake of
Sri Rama. He saw the city and became happy too.
Going from one building to another, Hanuma saw buildings in various shapes and forms
on every side.
Hanuma heard a sweet song which was decorated by sound from the three stars -
Mandra, Madhya and Tara of love Lorne women like Apsara women in heaven.
Hanuma also heard there and there sound from the tinkling of ornaments worn around
the waist in the houses of wealthy people, sounds of footfall over the stairs, sound from clapping of
arms by warriors and the roar of ogres.
Hanuma also heard there and there sound from the tinkling of ornaments worn around
the waist in the houses of wealthy people, sounds of footfall over the stairs, sound from clapping of
arms by warriors and the roar of ogres.
There Hanuma heard ritual chantings muttered by rakshasas in their houses. He saw
ogres engaged in the study of Vedas. He also saw roaring rakshasas who came together to praise
Ravana.
He saw many spies of Ravana and a big army of ogres which stood surrounding the
royal highway in the central zone of the city.
Hanuma saw those who were initiated into various Vedic practices, those who wore
matted locks on their head, those who had shaven heads, those who wore cowhides and other
clothing, those who were carrying Kusa grass as weapons and also those who had fire vessels as
weapons, those who carried hammers and clubs in their hands and also those who had worn staffs as
weapons, hose who were one-eyed, those who had one ear, hose who were pot-bellied and with hanging
breast, those who had horrible appearances, those with twisted mouths, those who were horrific and
also short people, those who carried bows and arrows those who carried swords, those who carried
pestles and clubs as weapons, those who carried excellent Parighas in their hands, those who shone
with strange armour, those who were not very fat, those who were not too thin, those who were
neither tall nor short, those who were not very fair, those who were not very dark, those who were
not very hunchbacked, those who were not very short, those who had great brilliance, those who
carried banners, those who carried flags and those who carried different weapons.
Hanuma saw many people, who had great might, who carried javelins and trees as
weapons, those who carried Pattisas and thunderbolts, those who carried in their hands slings and
nooses, those who carried flowered garlands, wearing sandal paste and decorated with the best
jewellery, those who had various kinds of appearances roaming freely at will, those who carried
sharp spikes and thunderbolts.
Hanuma saw at the front of the inner city, a hundred thousand central protective force
which was attentive and was positioned there at the command of Ravana.
That Hanuma saw Ravana's house with a golden doorway. That famed house was on the
top of a mountain. Motes filled with white lotuses surrounded it. It was also surrounded by a
compound wall. He watched the house again and again.
The great Hanuma entered secretly Ravana's inner city which was equal to paradise,
rendered noisy by the neighing of horses and tinkling of ornaments, by chariots, vehicles and
aerial-cars and decorated by auspicious elephants and horses and great elephants with four tusks
and by birds and animals in heat. It had beautiful entrances and was protected by thousands of
rakshasas with great strength.
Hanuma entered the inner city of Ravana which was filled with gold and had a
golden court-yard, with a central area decorated by pearls and diamonds of great value and
sprinkled daily with water containing superb algal locum and sandalwood.
Thus, this is the th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.The valiant Hanuma also heard truly all those words of Seetha, Trijata, and the threatening words 
of the female demons.
Thereafter, seeing that Seetha was a divine lady in the garden of Nandana, Hanuma echoed his thought 
in various ways.
"Seetha is being searched in all directions by many thousands and myriads of monkeys, the 
same Seetha has been found by me."
"By me, employed thoughtfully (by my Master) as a secret agent and gone about secretly with a view 
to ascertain the enemy's strength, this has been perceived.
"The characteristics of demons, this town, and the power of the king of demons, Ravana, have been 
perceived by me."
"It is proper for me to console the wife of Rama, desirous of seeing her compassionate husband 
towards all beings and who is of immeasurable might."
"I shall console this woman, whose face resembles a full moon, who is having an unforeseen affliction, 
who is tormented by grief and who is not attaining the end to her affliction."
"If I return without consoling this Seetha, the wife of Rama, even though her mind is tormented 
by grief, my departure becomes blemished."
"Not finding a rescue when I return to Kishkindha, the illustrious princess Seetha may give up 
her life."
"That long-armed Rama having the countenance of a full moon, eagerly longing to see Seetha, is 
fit to be consoled by me."
"It is not proper to speak with her within the sight of these female demons. How indeed is this 
to be done? I am indeed perplexed."
"If she is not consoled by me during the rest of this night, she will forsake her life by all means. 
There is no doubt about it."
"If Rama enquires of me as to what words did Seetha speak about him, what can I say to Rama without 
speaking now to this Seetha, the slender-waisted lady?"
"To me returning in haste from here without carrying Seetha's message Rama may get irritated and 
burn me up with his pungent eyes."
"Even if I instigate my master Sugreeva to do his best in the cause of Rama, his arrival here with 
an army will be futile."
"Staying here itself and getting hold of an opportunity even amid the female demons 
(when they are in attentive), I shall slowly console Seetha who is very much in distress."
"However, I am very small in stature, particularly as a monkey, and can speak now Sanskrit, the 
human language too."
"If I use the Sanskrit language like a Brahmin, Seetha will get frightened, thinking of me as Ravana. 
Especially, how can a monkey speak it?"
"Certainly, meaningful words of a human being are to be spoken by me. Otherwise, the virtuous Seetha 
cannot be consoled."
"Looking at my figure and the language, Seetha who was already frightened previously by the demons, 
will get frightened again."
"Thereafter, this large-eyed Seetha who is full of mind, thinking me as Ravana who can assume any 
form at will may shout, engendered by fear."
"As soon as Seetha shouts, a troop of female demons, wielding various kinds of weapons and 
appearing dreadful as Yama the Lord of Death, may assemble here."
"Then those ugly faced female demons may encircle me from all sides and try to catch and kill me 
with all their might."
"Then, seeing me running hither and thither, seizing big branches, twigs, and trunks of excellent 
trees, they may get alarmed with fear."
"The ugly faced female demons will be frightened with fear, after seeing my huge figure wandering 
in the grove."
"Then those female demons may call the other demons too retained by Ravana in his house."
"Those female demons with an element of turbulence and rapidity may rush into a battle with various 
kinds of weapons like spears lances and swords."
"Surrounded by them, I may not be able to reach the other shore of the great ocean, 
while destroying the army of demons."
"Or having jumped up (over me) many demons operating speedily may capture me. Then, Seetha may 
not be able to know the occurrence of my arrival. Even I may get captured too."
"Or the violent-minded demons may kill this Seetha. Consequently the work of Rama and Sugreeva 
will be ruined."
"Seetha is residing in this secret place, with a concealed access, surrounded by demons and encircled 
by an ocean."
"If I am killed in the battle or captured by the demons, I do not see any other companion for 
Rama who can fulfill this work (of searching for Seetha)."
"Even after due reflection, I do not see any monkey who can transgress the ocean with a breadth 
of one hundred Yojanas, in case I am killed."
"I am competent to kill even thousands of demons. I am quite sure. But, after doing such a large 
battle, I may not be capable of reaching the other shore of the ocean."
'Conflicts are unreal too and to me, there is no desire for uncertainty. which intellectual will 
do an assured act with an apprehension?"
"If I do not talk, there will be Seetha's death. If I talk to Seetha, this great lapse will occur."
"Actions which are going to be accomplished shortly, get spoiled at the hands of an accomplished 
shortly, get spoiled at the hands of a confused messenger when the actions are set in opposition to time and 
space, even as darkness disappears at sunrise."
"Even if a decision is taken, regarding what is worthy and what is worthless, it does not yield 
good results. Messengers boasting themselves to be learned, thus indeed ruin those actions."
"How does not my work get spoiled? How should I avoid my feebleness? Also, how does not my leaping 
across the sea become vain?"
"How can Seetha hear my words without fear?" Thinking in this way, the wise Hanuma made up his 
mind (as follows):
"If I eulogize Rama, who is unwearied in action and a good relation, I shall not frighten her, 
whose mind is directed towards that relation."
"Offering auspicious and righteous words about Rama the most excellent prince Ikshvaku dynasty 
who possesses a learned soul and myself speaking in a sweet voice, I shall make everything intelligible so that 
Seetha rightly believes everything."
The noble-minded Hanuman, abiding amid the twigs of the trees and seeing Seetha, spoke 
the following words of many kinds which were not futile.Hanuma, the highly energetic son of wind-god, with an inducement to obtain confidence 
from Seetha, again modestly spoke the following words:
"O illustrious lady! I am a monkey and a messenger of the wise Rama. O princess! Look 
at this ring too, marked with Rama's name."
"I brought this ring given by the high souled Rama, for the purpose of gaining your confidence. 
Get consoled indeed. Happiness to you! You are now free from the object of your grief."
"I brought this ring given by the high souled Rama, for the purpose of gaining your confidence. 
Get consoled indeed. Happiness to you! You are now free from the object of your grief."
The countenance of that large-eyed Seetha, which appeared charming with red and white 
eyes shone like a moon the king of stars liberated by Rahu the demon. Then, that young Seetha, gladdened 
by the message of her husband, became shy and message of her husband, became shy and well-pleased. Uttering 
delightful words, she praised Hanuma the great monkey (as follows):
"O Hanuma the best of monkeys! You have singly overpowered this place infested by demons. 
You are valiant. You are competent. You are intelligent."
"You, with an acclaimable gallantry, crossed the ocean having a width of one hundred 
Yojanas and an asylum of crocodiles, making it as a small puddle."
"O excellent of monkeys! For you there is no fear nor even bewilderment from Ravana. 
Hence, I do not consider you as an ordinary monkey."
"O the best of monkeys! If you are sent by that Rama, who knows the nature of his self, 
you are worthy of talking to me well."
"The indomitable Rama must not have sent you indeed, especially to me, without knowing 
your enterprise and without testing you in advance."
"Rama the righteous man who is true to his promise and Lakshmana of great splendour who 
enriches the joy of Sumitra are fortunately safe."
"If Rama is safe, with his anger why is he not scorching the earth with ocean as its 
belt, like rising fire at the end of the world?"
"Otherwise, Rama and Lakshmana are capable of holding down even the celestials. But I 
think there is no end indeed to my troubles."
"Is not Rama getting perturbed? Is he not tormented with grief? Is Rama the best of men 
now doing the right acts to annihilate the enemies?"
"Is Rama the prince miserable and confused? Is he even mistaken in his actions? I hope 
he is doing all acts which require human effort."
"Is Rama the annihilator of enemies as per necessity resorting to the two strategies 
viz., conciliatory and partaking approaches and even the three strategies viz., partaking, sowing dissension 
and open assault? Is he kind-hearted towards friends, with a wish to conquer the enemies?"
"Is he getting friends? Has he been approached for friendship by others? I hope he is 
having good friends and even so honoured by them."
"Is Rama the prince wishing the grace of the gods? Is he equally aware of the role of 
human endeavour and the role of fate?"
"O Hanuma! Is Rama not losing affection in me because of my staying away from home? Will 
he release me from this evil predicament?"
"Is Rama, who is habituated always to pleasures and not habituated to pains, not sinking 
into despondency by now getting this great pain?"
"Are you constantly hearing the news of safety of Kausalya, Sumitra and Bharata?"
"Is Rama worthy of honour, suffering from pain just because of me? Will he liberate me 
from my sorrow, without fixing his mind on something else?"
"I hope Bharata, having a brotherly affection, will send for my sake, an army furnished 
with banners, guarded by the ministers, consisting of ten anikinis (21870 elephants, 21870 chariots, 
65610 horses and 109350 foot soldiers) which were terrific in appearance."
"The glorious Sugreeva the lord of monkeys will indeed come for my sake along with his 
valiant monkeys, who have their tusks and nails as their weapons."
"Lakshmana, the strong man, who augments the joy of Sumitra and who is an expert in weaponry, 
will indeed destroy the demons by the multitude of his arrows."
"Within a short time, I hope see Ravana killed along with his companions in the battle-field 
by terrific weapons burning brightly."
"That face of Rama with its golden and with the fragrance of a lotus may be looking miserable 
as bereft of me and getting dehydrated too. I hope it is not parched by the sun, like a louts."
"Which Rama left the kingdom as an indication of his righteousness and to whom there 
was neither disturbance nor fear nor sorrow even while taking me to the forest by foot, I hope that 
the same Rama is maintaining boldness in his heart."
"To Rama, in the matter of affection, neither his mother nor his father nor any body 
else is equal to or more than me. O Hanuma the messenger! I wish to survive only as long as I hear the 
activity of my beloved."
Uttering thus those greatly meaningful and sweetly worthwhile words, Seetha the princess 
further abstained from talking so as to hear Hanuma's delightful words describing the matters pertaining 
to Rama.
Hearing Seetha's words, Hanuma of terrific prowess, keeping his joined palms on his head, 
spoke the following words in reply.
"O Seetha having lotus eyes! Rama does not know that you are here. For that reason, he 
did not take you back soon, as Indra the destroyer of strong holds did not take back Sachi, his wife."
"Soon after hearing my words, Rama will come soon, drawing forth a large army, consisting 
of a multitude of monkeys and bears."
"Rama will paralyze the imperturbable ocean with his flood of arrows and make the City 
of Lanka extinguished of demons."
"If the goddess of Death along with demons or celestials stand firmly in the way of Rama 
at that time, he will kill them also."
"O noble lady! Being full of grief caused by your non-appearance, that Rama is not obtaining 
happiness, like an elephant tornmented by a lion."
"O Seetha the princess! I swear and tell you by the mountains Malaya, Vindhya, Meru and 
Dardura as well as by our staple food of roots and fruits, that you will soon see Rama's face, having 
good eyes, handsome, having lips with the colour of a bright-red gourd (fruit of Momordica monodelpha) 
and with its charming look like a rising full moon."
"O Seetha! You will see soon Rama on the Prasravana mountain, like Indra the Lord of 
celestials seated on the back of Airavata, the chief of elephants."
"Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, 
he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him."
"With his mind wholly devoted to you, Rama is not even driving away forest-flies from 
his body, nor mosquitoes nor insects nor reptiles from his body."
"Rama always cogitates on something or the other. He is forever engaged in sorrow. He 
is enamoured with the god of love and thinks of nothing else."
"Rama mostly does not have sleep. Even if that best of men sleeps, he keeps awake uttering 
sweet words like "lo! Behold! Seetha!"
"When he happens to see a fruit or a flower or any other beautiful object, he recollects 
of you and says 'O beloved!' many times and breathes a sigh."
"O Seetha the princess! Rama the magnanimous prince is always lamenting, speaking just 
about you, recollecting "Seetha, Seetha!". Being firm in his vow, he makes effort to find you only."
"That Seetha, who has the same amount of grief as that of Rama, became worn out of her 
grief upon hearing the adoration of Rama, like a night with the moon obscured by the remnant clouds 
at the commencement of autumn."Looking at Ayodhya, Rama, a scion of Raghu dynasty, for his part, who wished to do a
kindly act and who was quick in exhibiting prowess, contemplated thereupon to do a kindly act.
Having thus contemplated, the sagacious and the glorious Rama then cast his glimpse
on the monkeys and spoke to Hanuma, the monkey (as follows):
"O the foremost of the monkeys! Going with all speed to Ayodhya, find out whether
the people there, are safe in the royal palace.
"Reaching then to Shrigaberapura, communicate in my name, about my welfare to Guha,
the king of Nishadas, a wild tribe living in the forest."
"Guha will be pleased to hear about me, as being safe, healthy and free from
trouble. He is my friend, as well as my own self."
Feeling pleased, Guha, the lord of Nishadas, the wild tribe, will tell the path to
Ayodhya and the news about Bharata."
"Bharata too is to be asked by you, the news about his welfare, in my name. Tell him
of me as having returned, accomplished of our object, with my consort and Lakshmana."
"Tell him about the abduction of Seetha by the mighty Ravana, my conversation with
Sugreeva and the killing of Vali in combat."
"Tell him also about the search for Seetha and how she was traced out by you, after
crossing the never-diminishing ocean, having extensive waters."
"Tell him about our going near the ocean, the appearance of the ocean, how the
bridge was constructed there and how Ravana was killed."
"Tell him about the bestower of boons by Indra the lord of celestials, by brahma the
lord of creation, and by Varuna the lord of waters, my meeting with my (deceased) father, through
the grace of Shiva the Supreme Deity."
"O gentle Hanuma! Inform to Bharata, of me as having come near Ayodhya, along with
Vibhishana and Sugreeva the lord of monkeys."
"Tell him, that having conquered hosts of enemies and obtained an excellent fame, is
purpose having been accomplished, Rama is coming near, with is mighty friends."
"It is also to be observed by you, about the facial expression which Bharata wears,
after hearing all this and also all that he intends to do in relation to me."
"All the occurrences there are to be known. All the gestures of Bharata are to be
ascertained through the colour of his face, glances and the speech."
"Whose mind does not turn round, with a kingdom abundantly rich in all coveted
enjoyments, teeming with elephants horses and chariots and which is in herited from one's
father?"
"Having been associated with the kingdom for long, if the illustrious Bharata is
longing for it himself, let Bharata rule the entire kingdom in one piece."
"O Hanuma! Understanding his mind and perception, you ought to return quickly,
before we are not gone for a long distance towards Ayodhya."
Assuming a human form, when thus commanded by Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god,
swiftly left for Ayodhya.
Hanuma, the son of wind-god then flew up with speed towards Ayodhya, as Garuda the
eagle would fly with speed, while seeking to catch a large snake.
Leaping into the auspicious sky, the dwelling place of birds, duly crossing over the
terrific conjunction of Ganga and Yamuna rivers, reaching Shringaverapura and approaching Guha (the
chief of Nishadas), that valiant Hanuma spoke the following words in a charming voice:
"Along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama, your friend, that scion of Kakutthsa, of
true prowess, has for his part enquired of your welfare."
"You can see Rama here itself today, when he has been duly permitted by Bharadwaja
the sage, after spending, at the instance of the sage, for a night of the fifth lunar day (of the
bright half of the month of Ashvayuja)."
That swift-moving Hanuma, with his rejoicingly feather-like body and with a great
splendor, not thinking of his fatigue, sprang up with a great speed.
Hanuma saw, on the way, Ramatirtha, a place of descent into the river (hallowed by
the association of Lord Parashurama), as well as the rivers Valukini, Varuthini and Gomati as also
the formidable forest of Sala trees, many thousands of people and numerous communities.
Going quickly for a long distance, that foremost of the monkeys reached trees in
flowering, near Nandigrama and looking like those comprised in the garden of Kubera (known by the
name, Chitraratha) and frequented by women along with their sons and elders, charmingly adorned as
they were.
At a distance of two miles from Ayodhya Hanuama saw Bharata, living in a hermitage,
with the bark trees and the skin of a black antelope wrapped round his waist, looking miserable and
emaciated, wearing matted locks on his head, his limbs coated with dirt, afflicted through
separation from Rama his elder brother, subsisting on roots and fruits, with his senses subdued,
engaged in austerities, protecting virtue, with a very high head of matted hair, covering his body
with the bark of trees and a deer skin, disciplined, whose thoughts were fixed on the Supreme
Spirit, with a splendour equalling that of a Brahmanical sage, ruling the earth after placing the
wooden sandals before him, protecting the people belonging to all the four grades (viz. Brahmans
Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Shudras) from all peril and attended by the upright ministers, priests and
by clever troop-commanders, all clad in saffron robes.
Those citizens, who were all fond of righteousness, were not willing to enjoy
pleasures, ignoring that prince clad in the bark of trees and the skin of a black antelope.
With joined palms in salutation, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke as follows to that
Bharata, who knew what is right and seemed to be a second Dharma (the god of virtue) clothed with a
body of virtue:
"Rama, for whom you are repenting residing as he was in the forest of Dandaka
wearing the bark of trees and matted locks, has enquired about your welfare."
"O Lord! I am telling you a pleasant news. Give up this dreadful anguish. Within a
while, you will be meeting Rama, your elder brother."
"Having killed Ravana and got back Seetha, Rama is returning with his mighty
friends, his purpose duly accomplished."
"Lakshmana too, who is endowed with extraordinary energy, is coming intact with
Seetha, the illustrious princess of Videha territory and with Rama as Sachi (the wife of Indra)
would with the mighty Indra the lord of celestials."
Hearing the words of Hanuma, Bharata the son of Kaikeyi, felt delighted and sank all
at once to the ground as also fainted through joy.
Thereupon, Bharata who was born in Raghu dynasty, got up from the swoon within a
while and regaining his consciousness, spoke the following words to Hanuma, who spoke pleasant
tidings to him.
Embracing Hanuma with eagerness, the illustrious Bharata bathed him with copious
tear-drops born of delight and as such, other than those born of anguish.
"O the gentle one! Are you a divine being or a human being, who have come here out
of compassion? To you, who have given this agreeable news to me, I shall give in return, for the
pleasant tidings, a hundred thousand cows, a hundred best villages, and for wives, sixteen golden
complexioned virgin girls of a good conduct, decked with ear-rings, having beautiful noses and
thighs, adorned with all kinds of jewels, with charming countenances as delightful as the moon and
born in a noble family."
Hearing the news of Rama's arrival resembling a womnder, from Hanuma, Bharata the
prince felt overjoyed by a desire to see Rama and spoke the following words again with delight:Thus directed by Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god, entered deeply into the City of
Lanka, being respectfully received by the demons.
That Hanuma, the monkey, known to Seetha, having entered the City of Lanka, seeking
permission from Vibhishana, getting approval from him and entering Ashoka grove as per the
prevailing regulation, saw at the foot of a tree, Seetha, who was bereft of freshness, looking
joylessly like a frightened cow and surrounded with female-demons. Approaching her humbly by
offering salutation to her in bending his head, he stood there silently.
Even after seeing the mighty Hanuma who came there, Seetha kept herself silent.
Then, seeing and recollecting him, she became rejoiced.
Seeing her cool face, Hanuma the excellent monkey began to narrate the entire
message of Rama.
"O Seetha! Rama is well, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, along with Vibhishana
as his supporter and collectively with the army of monkeys."
"O the divine lady! Having destroyed his enemy, Rama the annihilator of his
adversaries, having accomplished his object, is informing you about his welfare. Rama and
Lakshmana, with the support of Vibhishana and the monkeys, killed the valiant Ravana."
"O the divine lady! I am telling a pleasant news and again eulogizing you. O Seetha,
the knower of righteousness! Rama accomplished this great victory in the battle, because of your
power. Be free from your grief and be comfortable."
"Ravana, the enemy was killed. Even the Lanka has been subdued. With a firm
determination to win you back, by me who have had no sleep, a bridge has been constructed across
the great ocean and this vow (of winning you back) has been fulfilled."
"You ought not to have any fear, living as you do in Ravana's abode. This kingdom of
Lanka has now been placed indeed under the dominion ship of Vibhishana."
"That is why, console yourself complacently. You are staying in your own house. This
Vibhishana too is coming to you with a rejoice, as he is so eager to see you."
Hearing these words, that Seetha the divine lady, whose face resembled the moon,
could not speak, tongue-tied as she was with a thrill of delight.
Thereupon, Hanuma spoke to Seetha, who was not making any answer (as follows): "O
divine lady! What are you reflecting upon? Why don't you speak to me?"
Thus asked by Hanuma, Seetha, who was ever established in a righteous path, was very
much delighted and spoke (as follows) in a voice choked with tears.
"Hearing these pleasant tidings about the victory of my husband, I became speechless
for a while, overpowered as I was, by extreme joy."
"O, Hanuman! I indeed do not see any appropriate thing here, which pleases you in
return, to offer you, who have announced these tidings pleasant to me, even after enervating my
brain."
"Nor, do I perceive anything worthy for you on this earth for you act of conveying
this agreeable news to me and on bestowing which on you, happiness may come to me."
"Neither silver, nor gold nor even diamonds nor the sovereignty of the three worlds,
can be worthy of this message."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma standing with his face turned towards Seetha and
with his hands joined in salutation, joyfully replied as follows:
"O faultless lady, interested in things agreeable and beneficial to husband and
wishing for his victory! You alone deserve to speak such words filled with affection."
"O gentle lady! These words of yours, endowed with preciousness and affection, are
better than various kinds of collection of diamonds or the sovereignty over the celestials."
"I see Rama victorious and happy, he having killed the enemies and having obtained
victory. That is to say, I have attained the blessing like the sovereignty over the celestials and
other good qualities."
Hearing those words of Hanuma, Seetha the daughter of Janaka thereupon spoke the
following auspicious words to Hanuma.
"You alone can utter these words, endowed with exceedingly good attributes,
embellished with a grace of style and filled with an intelligence, consisting of eight
excellences.*"
"You are a praiseworthy and supremely virtuous son of the wind-god. Numerous good
qualities are there in you along (as follows, along with others): strength, valour, knowledge of
scriptures, vigour, prowess, superlative skill (in action), spirit, forbearance, firmness,
stability and re is no humility. There is no doubt about it."
Thereafter, having joined his hands together in salutation, standing in front of
Seetha in humility and free from flurry, Hanuma again spoke to Seetha (as follows):
"If you permit me, I wish to kill of all these notorious female-demons, by whom you
have been frightened earlier."
"These cruel female-demons of terrific form and behavior, with still more cruel
eyes, having ugly faces, were heard by me here speaking again and again harsh words to you, who are
so devoted to your husband, at Ravana's command, when you were suffering hardships in the Ashoka
grove, O divine lady!"
"I wish to kill with various kinds of strokes, these cruel, extremely rough and
deformed female-demons, with distorted features and terrific hairs and eyes, talking together
roughly. (Pray) grant this boon to me."
"I wish to kill the female-demons, who have spoken harsh words to you and wronged
you, striking them down with my fists, hand-blows, long arms, blows of my shanks and knees, by
causing pain to their teeth, biting off their ears and nose and pulling out their hair, making them
severely dry-mouthed, tearing them off, leaping over them, encountering them and throwing down
their bodies, with their burst cheeks, necks, shoulders and ribs."
"O illustrious lady! Striking them with several blows in this way, I would destroy
the female-demons of terrible form, by whom you have been threatened in the past."
Reflecting as pondering for a while, when spoke thus by Hanuma, the compassionate
Seetha, who was kind to the miserable, spoke to Hanuma as follows:
"O the foremost of monkey! Who will be angry with servant-maids, who are dependent
on their king's command and work in obedience to the orders of others?"
"All this is reaped by me, as a consequence of my bad fortune or an account of a
misdeed committed by me in the past. The fruit of one's own making is indeed experienced (in one's
life)."
"O the great-armed Hanuma! Do not speak like this. This is indeed a great divine
strategy. It was ordained that this type of situation is to be obtained by me, due to the
application of fate. Feeble as I am in these matters, I am forgiving the servant-maids of Ravana
here."
"O Hanuma! As commanded by Ravana the threatened me. As he is dead now, they will
not do the threatening."
"O Hanuma! There is an old axim possessed of merit, actually uttered by a bear in
the presence of a tiger. Hear it from me."
"A superior person does not take into account the sin of those who have committed an
offence evil for evil must be carried out at all costs virtuous persons account good conduct as an
ornament."
"Kindness is to be shown by a noble person either towards a sinner or to a virtuous
person or even to a person who deserves death, for, there is none who never commits a wrong."
"No evil is to be done, even to those cruel persons of sinful deeds, who take
pleasure to harm the life of others and continue to perpetrate their sinful acts."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma who was skilled in speech, then replied to the
faultless Seetha, Rama's consort (as follows):
"O divine lady! You are the apt wife of Rama, full of virtue. Give me a message in
return. I will go to the place where Rama is."
Thus spoken by Hanuma, that Seetha the daughter of Janaka spoke as follows: "O the
foremost of monkeys! I long to see my husband."
Hearing those words of Seetha, the highly intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god,
bringing delight to Seetha, spoke the following words:
"You shall see today, Rama whose countenance is like a full moon, whose friends
(like Sugreeva and Vibhishana) are alive, whose enemies have been killed along with Lakshmana, as
Shachi (the consort of Indra) would see Indra the lord of gods."
Thus speaking to that Seetha, who appeared radiant before his eyes as Lakshmi the
goddess of prosperity, Hanuma of great splendor, came to the place where Rama was.
Then, Hanuma the excellent of monkeys speedily narrated, in order of sequence, the
message given by Seetha, to Rama who was equal to Indra the chief of celestials.Thereafter, those seven sons of his chief minister having a lustre similar to that of 
fire, surrounded by a great army, wielding their respective bows, possessing great strength, well-trained 
in archery and the best among knower of weapons, wishing a victory reciprocally, having an immense prowess 
each, and as directed by Ravana, started highly delighted from that palace, in great chariots yoked 
with horses. Those chariots had a noise similar to that of an autumnal cloud, overlaid with 
a protective armour of gold, surmounted by banners and decorated with smaller flags. They were stretching 
their bows inlaid with refined gold and looking colourful like clouds accompanied by flashes of lightning.
Coming to know that Kimkaras themselves were killed by their mothers together with their 
relatives and friends were tormented with grief.
Those sons of the chief minister, wearing ornaments made of pure gold, rushed towards Hanuma, 
who was ready for battle and who stood on the archy gateway motionless.
Those demons looked like clouds, diffusing the thunder-like sounds of their chariots and 
discharging a shower of arrows, moved in different directions resembling rainy clouds in the monsoon.
Thus covered by those showers of arrows, Hanuma became invisible even as a mountain king 
is concealed by incessant showers.
Roaming about in a cloudless sky, that fast-footed monkey made the arrows and the speedy 
chariots of those virile demons, useless.
Playing with those demons wielding a bow each in the sky, that hero shone like the Lord 
of Wind, playing with clouds brandishing a rainbow.
Making a terrific roar and frightening that great army, the valiant Hanuma rushed on 
those demons.
That Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies, struck some with his palms, some with his feet 
and some others with his fists. He tore down some others with his nails.
Hanuma crushed some with his chest and some others with his thighs. Some fell there 
itself on the ground, just by the roar made by Hanuma.
Seeing those demons dying and falling on the ground, all the remaining army, afflicted 
with fear, fled in ten different directions.
Their elephants trumpeted with the wrong accent. Horses fell on the ground. Even the 
earth was filled with chariots which had their seats, banners and canopies broken.
Thereafter, streams flowing with blood were seen on the way. Lanka resounded with various 
kinds of horrible voices.
That heroic and mighty Hanuma having terrible prowess, killing those arrogant demons 
and being desirous of a combat with the other demons, again reached that archy doorway itself.Seeing Narantaka dying, Devantaka, Trishira and Mahodara the son of Pulastya the
foremost of demons, wept.
Mounting an excellent elephant, resembling a cloud, Mahodara hurrily attacked Angada
of great energy.
The strong Devantaka, tormented at his brother's calamity, then taking a terrific
iron rod, ran towards Angada.
Thereupon, the valiant Trishira, mounting a chariot resembling the sun and yoked
with excellent horses, marched towards Angada.
That Angada, being attacked by the three chief demons, who were capable of smashing
the pride of celestials, uplifted a tree with its large boughs.
The valiant Angada hurled that large tree with big branches quickly on Devantaka as
Indra the lord of celestials would a blazing thunderbolt.
Trishira chopped off that tree with arrows looking like serpents. Seeing the tree
chopped off, that Angada then sprang up.
Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys streamed forth trees and rocks. The enraged
Trishara chopped them off with his sharp arrows.
That Mahodra broke those trees with the tip of his club. Trishira too with his
arrows attacked the valiant Angada.
Marching ahead quickly towards Angada on an elephant, the enraged Mahodara struck on
his chest with javelins looking like thunderbolts.
Then, the enraged Devantaka with a speed, approached Angada, struck him quickly with
a club and went off to a distance.
Eventhough attacked at the same time by those three foremost of demons, that Angada
of great prowess and splendour, did not get alarmed.
The speedy and quite unconquerable Angada, acting with a great swiftness and
attacking well, struck Devantaka's elephant with his palm.
By that blow of Angada in battle, the eyes of that royal elephant fell down and that
elephant died.
Pulling out a tusk of that elephant in battle, the mighty Angada ran towards
Devantaka quickly and struck him.
That energetic Devantaka swayed to and fro in disorder, like a tree being tossed up
by the wind and emitted plenty of blood with the colour of a lacquer.
Thereafter, the strong Devantaka of great splendour, recovering his breath with a
great difficulty, then struck Angada violently, by firmly holding an iron rod.
Then, Angada the son of king Vali, struck by the iron rod, fell down on his knees on
the earth, but again jumped up.
While Angada, the son of Vali was jumping up, Trishira struck him with three
terrific and straight-going arrows on his forehead.
Noticing Angada being surrounded by the three demon-warriors, Hanuma and Neela went
there.
Thereupon, Neela then hurled a mountain-peak on Trishira. The intelligent Trishira
the son of Ravana broke it by using his sharp arrows.
That mountain-peak, broken into pieces by a multitude of arrows, with its split up
rocks, fell down with sparks of fire and flames.
Seeing Hanuma rushing with enthusiasm in the battle-front, that strong Devantaka ran
towards him with his iron rod.
Then, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, while jumping up, struck on the head of
Devantaka rushing upon him with his fist equal to a thunder-bolt.
Then, the valiant and the strong Hanuma struck him on his head. That great ape made
the demons shake with the sound.
That Devantaka, the son of Ravana, with his head crushed and broken by the blow of
the fist, with his teeth and eyes coming out and with his tongue hanging down, swiftly fell down
dead on the earth.
When that Devantaka the mighty chief of demon-warriors and the enemy of celestials
was killed in battle, the enraged Trishira showered a terrible rain of sharp-pointed arrows on
Neela's chest.
Again mounting an elephant resembling a mountain, as the sun mounting Mandara
Mountain, that enraged Mahodara on his part, caused rain of arrows to fall quickly on Neela, like
rumbling cloud with a circle of lightning, showers rain on a mountain.
Thereupon, by the rain of a multitude of arrows, the body of Neela the commander of
the army of monkeys became blown up. Thus the mighty Mahodara then made his loosened limbs
paralyzed.
After regaining consciousness, Neela uplifted a mountain consisting of a number of
trees and then jumping up with a great speed, struck with it on the head of Mahodara.
That Mahodara, then shattered by the fall of that mountain and crushed by that large
elephant too, lost his life and fell down on the earth like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt.
Seeing Mahodara his young paternal uncle killed. Trishira was enraged seized hold of
his bow and struck Hanuma with sharp arrows.
While that enraged Hanuma hurled a mountain-peak, the strong Trishira broke it into
several pieces with his sharp arrows.
Seeing that mountain-peak becoming useless, Hanuma then hurled a volley of trees
towards Trishira in that battle-field.
The valiant Trishira chopped off that volley of trees descending on him, with his
sharp arrows in the sky itself and roared aloud.
Then, the enraged Hanuma on his part, bouncing up, tore asunder with his nails,
Trishira's horse, as a lion tears asunder a large elephant.
Thereupon, Trishira the son of Ravana seizing hold of a spear, as Yama the lord of
death takes in his service Kalaratri, a night of all-destroying time, hurled it on Hanuma.
Capturing that spear coming like a meteor in the sky, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys
broke it, even without its descending on him and roared too.
Seeing that spear of a terrific form broken up by Hanuma, the monkey-troops were
very much delighted and roared aloud like rumbling clouds.
Thereupon, lifting up a sword, Trishira the foremost of demons them dug it into
Hanuma's breast.
Hurt by the thrust of the sword, the valiant Hanuma the son of wind-god, struck
Trishira on his breast, with his palm.
Struck by Hanuma's palm, that Trishira of great splendour fell down unconscious on
the earth with the weapons slipping from his hand.
Hanuma, that large ape, equal to a mountain in size, snatching away that falling
sword of Trishira, roared loudly frightening all the demons there.
Unable to bear that roar, the demon jumped up and struck Hanuma with his fist.
Enraged as he was by the blow of Trishiras's fist, Hanuma seized hold of Trishira
the foremost of demons by his head covered by his diadem.
That enraged Hanuma the son of wind-god chopped off with that sharp sword, his three
heads furnished with diadems and ear-rings, like Indra the lord of celestials chopped off the heads
of Vishvarupa the son of Tvashta.
Those mountain-like heads of Trishira the enemy of Indra, having longish organs of
senses and having fire-like blazing eyes, fell down on earth, as planets and stars drop from the
track of the sun.
When that Trishira, the enemy of celestials, having a prowess equal to that of Indra
was killed, the monkeys made a loud noise. The earth trembled. Then, the demons ran away
everywhere. Seeing Trishira, Mahodara and the invincible Devantaka killed, Matta (Mahaparshva) was
enraged with indignation.
Then, Mahaparshva was holding a large mace, which was resplendent, completely made
of iron, wound round with golden wires, filled with a froth of flesh and blood, satiated with the
blood enemies, the upper most part of which was blazing with splendour, decked with red coloured
garlands and which frightened the elephants supporting the quarters like Airavata, Mahapadma and
Sarvabhauma.
Taking that mace, the enraged Matta, the foremost of demons, went quickly to the
monkeys like the blazing fire at the end of the world.
Then, a strong monkey called Rishabha came jumping and stood in front of that
Mattanika (Mahaparshva), the younger brother of Ravana.
Enraged in seeing that Rishabha, looking like a mountain, standing before him,
Mahaparshva struck him upon his breast with a mace equaling a thunderbolt.
When he struck with his mace, the breast of that Rishabha the foremost of demons was
broken. He then trembled and exuded blood profusely.
That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while and
enraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva.
That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while and
enraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva.
With his body drenched in blood, that Mahaparshva suddenly fell unconscious on the
ground, like a tree with its root cut off. Then, taking quickly Mahaparshva's mace, which was
looking like Yama's rod, he roared loudly.
Mahaparshva remained as though he was dead for a while. Springing suddenly after
regaining his consciousness, that demon, whose colour resembled his consciousness, that demon,
whose colour resembled an evening cloud, struck that Rishabha, the son of Varuna the lord of
waters.
That Rishabha fell unconscious for a while on the ground. Rising after regaining
consciousness and tightly holding just the same mace, which was looking like a large mountain-peak,
banged it on Mahapatra in the battle-field.
That terrific mace, reaching the body of Mahaparshva, the fierce demon, the enemy of
celestials, sacrificial rites and Brahmanas, broke his chest. Mahaparshva started exuding copious
blood, as a supreme mountain exudes water full of minerals.
The great souled Rishabha quickly ran towards the mace of that mighty Mahaparshva.
Seizing that dreadful mace and striking it repeatedly on the floor, he struck it on Mahaparshva in
the battle-front.
Struck by his own mace, that Mahaparshva with his teeth and eyes fallen out, fell
down like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt.
When that demon depleted his strength, burst open his eyes, with his long life gone
away and fallen down on the ground, the army of demons ran away.
When that Mahaparshva was killed, that army of demons, which was as extensive as an
ocean, abandoning their weapons in the battle-field, fled for mere lives, like a sea which has
burst its shores.Hearing that terrific roar, similar to the sound of Indra's thunderbolt, the monkeys
looking hither and thither, ran away in all directions.
Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke (as follows) to all those monkeys, who were
running away widely apart, looking dejected, miserable and frightened.
"O, monkeys! Why are you running away, looking dejected and leaving your zeal to
fight? Where has your valour gone?"
"Come along closely behind me, while I am marching ahead in the battle. For the
valiant who are born in a good family, it is not indeed proper to shrink back from the battle."
Hearing the words of that wise Hanuma, the monkeys in a cheerful mood, took hold of
mountain-peaks and trees in a great fury.
The foremost of monkeys, while roaring, rushed towards the demons. They followed
him, by surrounding Hanuma on all sides, in that great battle.
That Hanuma, being surrounded by those monkey-chiefs on all sides, began to consume
that army of adversaries as a flaming fire.
That Hanuma, accompanied by his army of monkeys, brought about the destruction of
demons, as Yama the lord of death does at the time of universal dissolution.
Filled with inordinate grief and rage, that Hanuma the monkey-chief, threw a large
rock on Indrajit's chariot.
On seeing that rock rushing towards them, the obedient horses, yoked to that
chariot, carried the chariot off to a far-distance.
That rock employed in vain, without reaching that Indrajit and his charioteer
sitting in the chariot, split itself into fragments and penetrated the ground.
The demons were very much bruised by the falling fragments of the rock. That army of
demons was perturbed over the rock thus falling upon them.
Hundreds of monkeys with their colossal bodies, lifting up trees and mountain-peaks,
rushed roaring towards Indrajit.
Those monkeys of terrible prowess, threw trees and mountain-peaks towards Indrajit
in battle. While shooting a large deluge of trees and rocks, the monkeys caused destruction of
their enemies. They roared in various high tones.
Beaten forcibly with trees, by those highly terrible monkeys, those demons of
frightful appearance, rolled about restlessly in the battle-field.
On seeing his army tormented by the monkeys, that enraged Indrajit, taking hold of
his weapons, sallied forth, facing towards his enemies.
That Indrajit, of firm fortitude, accompanied by his army, by releasing a multitude
of arrows, killed a very many number of monkeys.
In the battle, Indrajit's soldiers too killed the monkeys with spikes tips of
missiles, swords, sharp-edged spears and concealed weapons similar to mallets.
The mighty Hanuma played a havoc among demons of terrible deeds, with Shala trees,
distinguished by excellent trunks and branches as with rocks.
Keeping the hostile army back, that Hanuma spoke to those monkeys as follows:
"Retreat! This army need not be conquered any more by us."
"That Seetha for whose sake we have fought so far, with a wish to do what is
pleasing to Rama, making a special effort to win, risking our lives has been killed."
"Informing Rama and even Sugreeva about this matter, we shall do that which both of
them are prepared to do in return."
Thus speaking and keeping back all the monkeys, Hanuma the chief of monkeys, with
absence of fear, along with his army, gradually turned back.
Seeing Hanuma with drawing to the place where Rama was, the evil-minded Indrajit
went to a sanctuary called Nikumbhila, seeking to pour oblations into the sacred fire.
Arriving at Nikumbhila, Indrajit poured oblations into the sacred fire. Thereupon,
while being propitiated by that demon on reaching sacrificial ground, the sacrificial fire then
blazed up on consuming the oblations of flesh and blood.
Swollen up when propitiated with oblations of blood, the highly intense fire, like
the evening sun, appeared wrapped in flames.
Then, Indrajit, well-versed with the technique of performance of rites for the
prosperity of the demons, poured oblations according to the scriptural precepts. Seeing this, those
demons, who knew what was prudent and evil in major battles, stood firm in big piles (by Indrajit's
side).Hanuma, with a rush equal to that of wind, without a fatigue, leaped across the boundless 
	sea looking analogous to the sky, like a large ship crossing the ocean. In that pleasant and auspicious 
	sky-like sea shone the moon as a white water-like sea, shone having the constellations known by 
	the names of Pushya and Shravana as swans, the clouds as its duck-weeds; the twin constellations 
	the Punarvasus as its large fish, the planet Mars as its large alligator, a large island as Airavata 
	(Indra's elephant), graced with a swan in the form of the constellation, Shwati, having gales as 
	its waves, the moon bear. ns as its cool water, and with the Nagas, yakshas, and Gandharvas as its full 
	blown lotuses and water lilies.
While moving in the sky, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind god and the great 
	monkey, appeared as if swallowing the sky, scratching the moon and carrying off the sky with its 
	stars and the disc of the sun and was going as though dragging asunder, a mass of clouds.
Dense clouds, with white and red colors, blue and yellow colors as also green and 
	reddish brown colors shone brightly in the sky.
Time and again, entering and coming out of the clusters of clouds, Hanuma appeared 
	like the moon becoming visible and invisible again and again.
The heroic Hanuma, who was clad in white clothes, having faund his way into various 
	kinds of dense clouds (and emerging again) and having his personality becoming visible and invisible, 
	shone like the moon in the sky.
Tearing asunder the clusters of clouds again and again as also emerging from them 
	and roaring with a big noise, Hanuma the son of wind-god, making a thunderous great sound, shone 
	flying like Garuda the eagle, in the sky.
Killing the foremost of demons, becoming famous by its name, making Lanka perplexed, 
	causing anguish to Ravana by tormenting his terrible army, and bidding his adieu to Sheetha, Hanuma 
	returned by flying over the middle of the sea.
Touching Mount Mainaka, the victorious Hanuma came with a great speed resembling 
	an iron arrow discharged from a bow-string.
Approaching a bit near and observing Maunt Mahendra, the great mountain looking like 
	a dense cloud and Hanuma made a loud noise.
Emitting a great roar, that Hanuma, whole loud noise resembled the rumbling of a 
	cloud filled the whole space in all directions with noise.
Having reached that place, Hanuma who was ardently desirous of seeing his friends, 
	roared and waved his tail.
The sky, with the disc of the sun, began to crack as it were, due to his roar, even 
	as he repeatedly roared on the path of the sky followed by Garuda, the eagle endowed with charming 
	wings.
Those mighty heroes who were waiting already on the northern shore of the sea, with 
	an eagerness to see Hanuma, heard there at that time, the sound produced by the sweeping motion 
	of Hanuma's thighs, which resembled the roar of a huge cloud propelled by the wind.
All those monkeys, who were distressed in mind (for not having heard the news of 
	Seetha hitherto), heard Hanuma's roar similar to the roar of a rumbling cloud.
Hearing the roar of Hanuma, who was making the sound, all those monkeys stationed 
	there in all directions, became anxiously desirous about seeing their friend.
The Jambavan, the foremost among the monkeys and bears, with his mind thrilled with 
	joy, having summoned all the monkeys, spoke the following words:
"This Hanuma has accomplished his assignment in all ways. His sound will not indeed 
	be like this if he has not fulfilled his task. There is no doubt in this matter."
Hearing the sound of the dashing movement of the high-souled Hanuma's arms and thighs, 
	the monkeys moved by jumping with joy from their respective places.
Those monkeys with joy, longing to see Hanuma, took off from the top of one tree 
	to the tops of other trees as well from one mountain-summit to the other summits.
Those monkeys, grasping the boughs at the tops of trees, and standing there firmly, 
	joyously waved the twigs, as if they were their raiments.
The mighty, Hanuma the son of the wind-god, roared as though the wind roared while it 
	entered the caves of mauntains.
Seeing that Hanuma then rushed like a dense cloud, all those monkeys stood there, 
	joining their palms in salutation.
The swift Hanuma, looking like a mountain, then descended on the summit of that Mount 
	Mahendra, thick with trees.
Hanuma like a mountain with its wings torn off, thrilled with joy, fell from the 
	sky into a charming mountain torrent.
Then, all the foremost of those monkeys, with their pleasing hearts, stood surrounding 
	the high-souled Hanuma. Having encircled Hanuma, all of them obtained a supreme joy.
All those monkeys with their delightful faces, taking roots and fruits as their presents, 
	honored Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, who came back hale and healthy.
Then, Hanuma the excellent one among the monkeys, on his part, offered his salutation 
	to venerable persons and elders like Jambavan in the first place, as also Angada, the prince.
Jambavan and Angada honored that victorious and venerable Hanuma. The other monkeys 
	also made him gracious. Hanuma informed them briefly that he had seen Seetha.
Then, seizing the hand of Angada, Vali's son, Hanuma sat down at a distinct spot 
	in the charming forest of Mount Mahendra.
Then, the pleased Hanuma spoke the following words to those excellent monkeys: "I 
	saw that Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who was staying in Ashoka garden, guarded unblemished by 
	highly dreadful female demons and wearing a single braid, young woman, as she was, longing to see 
	Rama, thoroughly fatigued due to her fasting, with her hair twisted together, wearing soiled clothes 
	and looking emaciated."
Hearing from Hanuma that important and nectar-like word to the effect that Sheetha 
	had been seen all the monkeys became delighted.
Some mighty monkeys made a lion's roar. Some were making a sound of approbation. 
	Some were making a sound of thunder. Some others produced cries expressing joy. Some others were 
	roaring in return.
Some eminent monkeys, with joy and with their tails lifted, waved their distended 
	curved tails.
Descending from the mountain-tops; some other monkeys, with delight, fondlingly touched 
	Hanuma who resembled an elephant.
After hearing the words of Hanuma, Angada spoke the following excellent words in 
	the midst of those eminent monkeys.
"O Hanuma! Since you returned here crossing the extensive ocean, none stands equal 
	to you in strength and prowess."
"What amazing is your devotion to the Lord! What a wonderful prowess! What a surprising 
	courage! By our good fortune, you saw the illustrious Sheetha, Rama's consort. Thank heaven! Rama 
	can give up his sorrow born out of Sheetha's separation."
Very much delighted, the monkeys then sat on extensive flat rocks encircling Angada, 
	Hanuma and Jambavan.
Longing to hear about crossing the ocean and seeing Lanka, Sheetha, and Ravana, 
	all those excellent monkeys waited with their joined pal. ns, in anticipation of Hanuma's words.
The auspicious Angada encircled by many monkeys there, waited like Indra the lord 
	of celestials, who was waited upon by celestials in heaven.
The high and large summit of the mountain, on which were seated then with delight, 
	the illustrious Hanuma and the famous Angada, with bracelets worn on his upper ar. ns stood blazed 
	with splendor.Then, after fulfilling his heart's wish, Hanuma, looking over Lanka, thought about the 
remaining act to be done, with an augmented energy.
"Which act indeed is remaining now to be done by me here, that may further create anguish 
to these demons?"
"I have demolished the garden. I have killed excellent demons. I destroyed a portion 
of the army. The demolition of the fort is remaining."
"When the fort gets destroyed, the task (of Rama's battle) will be devoid of fatigue. 
Even with a small effort in this task, the work will become fruitful."
"It is justified to satisfy this blazing flame on my tail, by feeding it to the full, 
with these excellent houses (in the city of Lanka)."
Then, Hanuma, with his burning tail, strolled over the house-tops of Lanka, like a cloud 
charged with lightning.
Surveying the gardens and lofty palatial mansions, Hanuma, without fear, passed 
from one house to another, of the demons.
Jumping down on Prahasta's house, the valiant Hanuma, with great swiftness, having the strength 
equal to wind, scattering fire on it, jumped over from there, to another house belonging to Mahaparsva. 
Hanuma, with great swiftness, having strength equal to wind, scattering fire on it, jumped over from 
there, to another house belonging to Mahaparsva. Hanuma scattered a fire there resembling a flame of 
fire that is to destroy the world.
That Hanuma, of great splendour, then leapt to the houses of Vajradamshtra, Shuka and 
Sarana, the intelligent.
Leaving the house of Vibhishana, Hanuma of great splendour, went successively to the 
houses of Rashmiketu, Surya shatru, Hrasvakarna, Damshtra, Romasha the demon, Yuddhonmatta, Matta, Dhvajagreeva 
the demon, the terrific Vidyujjihva, Hastimukha, Karala, Pishacha, Shonitaaksha, Kumbhakarna, Makaraksha, 
Yajnashatru, Brahmashatru, Narantaka, and Kumbha as also evil-minded Nikumbha and burnt the houses.
That Hanuma of great fame burnt away wealth in the mansions of the rich.
Having passed over all the houses, the mighty and glorious Hanuma thereafter approached 
the house of Ravana the king of demons.
Thereafter, scattering a blazing fire located at the tip of his tail, on that principle 
house, decorated with various kinds of precious stones, resembling Mounts Meru and Mandara as also embellished 
with all good work, the valiant Hanuma roared like a cloud thundering at noon-time in a rainy season.
In contact with the wind, the fire escalated with great speed and intensity, blazing 
like a fire that is to destroy the world.
The wind carried the blazing fire to other houses. In conjunction with the wind, the 
the fire became very swift.
Those large houses, with golden windows, embedded with pearls, gems and precious jewels 
were shattered to pieces.
The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost 
their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying "Alas! The fire god has come really 
in the form of this monkey!"
Some women crying and carrying their suckling's with their hair dishevelled, fell down 
from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from 
clouds in the sky.
That Hanuma saw molten metals mixed with diamonds, corals, cat's eye-gems, pearls and 
silver, surging from every marvellous house.
As the fire is not satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma 
is not wearied of killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number 
of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap).
Flames of fire glittered like Kimshuka flowers at some places, blossoms of Shalmali tree 
at some places and like saffron flowers at some other places.
The high-souled Hanuma, the swift monkey scorched the city of Lanka, as Rudra scorched 
the city of Tripura.
Then, the fire having a terrific prowess, diffused by the swift Hanuma, stretching out 
a circle of flames, blazed and rose to the summit of the mountain on which the city of Lanka.
That fire diffused on those buildings, together with the wind picked up a speed equal 
to that of a fire at the time of dissolution of the world. It grew taller, touching the sky with a smokeless 
splendour. Those flames of fire shot up, as inflamed by ghee
The great fire persisted, surrounding the entire Lanka, having a good splendour equal 
to that of millions of suns and blazed like a broken-up hemisphere of the world, creating many sounds 
of a wide-spread thunderbolt.
The fire with a fierce splendour there, extended fully to the sky, shooting flames like 
Kumshuka flowers. The clouds, bearing the colour of blue lotuses, shone as covered by smoke formed out 
of the extinguished fire.
"He is not a monkey. He is either Indra the Lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt, 
or Yama the lord of death of water, or the wind-god or the fire seated in the third eye of Lord Shiva 
or the sun-god or Kubera the lord of riches or the moon-god. He may be Kala (the Time-spirit) himself."
"Whether the rage of four-faced Brahma, the grandfather of all and the creator of all 
has arrived here in the guise of a monkey, playing the role of a destroyer of demons?"
"Or whether a supreme bright energy of Vishnu, the lord of maintenance of the Universe, 
unthinkable, unmanifest, infinite and pearless, arrived now, assuming the form of a monkey for the destruction 
of demons, by Her extraordinary power?"
Thus spoke all those excellent troops of demons in multitude, gathering together there, 
on seeing that city scorched so soon, with its host of living beings, houses and trees.
Then, Lanka having been scorched with its demons, horses, chariots, elephants, multitude 
of birds, animals and trees, cried pitiably with tumultuous noise.
Making a very terrific noise with a dreadful sound, the demons cried in various ways 
as follows: "O my dear beloved son! O, my beloved husband! O, my friend! O my very auspicious life, filled 
with enjoyments!"
That Lanka appeared as though afflicted by a curse, as defeated by a strong fury of Hanuma, 
enveloped by flames of fire, with its distinguished heroes killed and with its warriors in retreat.
Hanuma, with his great mind, saw Lanka with its dazed, frightened and dejected demons, 
marked by blazing flames of fire and afflicted by the fury of Brahma the creator of the universe.
After demolishing the garden which was full of excellent trees, killing great demons 
in battle and burning that city endowed with a series of excellent houses, Hanuma the monkey and the 
son of wind-god, stood at ease.
Standing there on the wonderful flat summit of Mount Trikuta, Hanuma the foremost leader 
of the monkeys, having a garland of flames formed by his blazing tail, shone like the sun having a garland 
of rays.
Killing those multitudes of demons, demolishing that garden endowed with several trees 
and scattering fire on the houses of demons, the high-souled Hanuma sought Rama with his mind.
Then, all the multitude of celestials realised that Hanuma, the principal warrior of 
the monkeys, possessing great strength and swiftness similar to the wind, are greatly intelligent and the 
most excellent.
Demolishing the garden, and killing the demons in battle, Hanuma of great splendour shone 
brightly, after burning the beautiful City of Lanka.
Seeing that city of Lanka burnt there, celestials, saints and great sages along with 
celestial's musicians got a colossal surprise.
Seeing that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and a mighty monkey, all the created 
beings were frightened, thinking of him as a fire that was to destroy the world.
There, all the celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Nagas the celestial 
serpents, Yakshas the spirits and all great living beings attained great joy.Mindful of the words of noble-souled Sugreeva, Hanuma took his flight from Mt. Rishyamuka to where the Raghavas are. Casting off his monkey's semblance Air-god's son Hanuma attained the persona of an ascetic, for that monkey is incredulous in mind about Raghavas. Then on nearing Raghavas, Hanuma voicing softly and well pleasingly like an obedient one, that best monkey befittingly hailed, greeted, and praised those two valiant ones. The best Vanara Hanuma spoke soft-wordily, as desired by Sugreeva, to those candidly resolute ones, on making reverent obeisance to both of them. "You two look like kingly saints, or deities by your build, ascetics with blest vows, but with ideal complexions... how come you arrived at this countryside scaring the herds of animals and other inhabitants of this forest... "You mighty ones you are watching the trees grown on the banks of Pampa from all over, and owing to your presence on these banks you make this river Pampa with its propitious waters shine forth... but you with your golden hue appear as courageous ones, yet you sigh repeatedly, you wear jute clothes, yet you look mighty shouldered... who are you that distress all the beings in this forest... "Dauntless, bold, and brave are you with sharp glances of lions, wielding bows like that of Indra's bow you are the real enemy destroyers... glorious, splendid, and even impetuous you appear like Sacred Bulls... elephant's trunks are your arms... and you foremost among men are self-resplendent... "This lord-like mountain is effulgent with your brilliance, you two look as kingdom-worthy, or worthy divinities, but how you have reached this countryside now... "Eyes of yours are like fine lotus petals, are you superhuman... nay, you wear tufts and braids, are you some undaunted human ascetics... nay, you look clonal, are you from some world of gods... nay, you are on earth, does this earth have a chance to receive the Sun and Moon on her by her fortune... nay, are you some broad-chested deities in human form... lion-shouldered, very vehement and vigorous like Sacred Bulls... who you might be... "Also lengthy are your hands, and spherical are your shoulders similar to clubs... they are worthy for decoration with every kind of ornament, for what reason they are undecorated... "I deem that each of you is the choicest one to protect the earth adorned with Mt Meru and Vindhya range, and with all her oceans and forests... "And these awesome bows are polished with odd things are smooth, and they are brightening like the gilded Thunderbolt of Indra. "Full with hazardous, life-terminating, fiery snake-like sharp arrows are these quivers, admirable in their appearance... "Dazzling are these amply wide, broad, and gilded swords like the snakes just released from their molts... "When I have been talking to you this way, what for you don't speak up... one named Sugreeva, somebody virtuous and worthily one among monkeys is expelled by his brother Vali, and he is roaming all over the world sorrowfully... "Delegated by that great soul and the king of important monkeys Sugreeva, I have come here and by name, I am Hanuma, another Vanara... "He that righteous Sugreeva is desiring friendship with you two, and know me as a monkey and his minister, the son of Air-god... I had to come here from Mt. Rishyamuka in an ascetic form only to appease that Sugreeva and I can wend my way by my will, and wear any guise as I wish..." Hanuma said so to those brothers. Saying thus to those valorous Rama and Lakshmana, Hanuma, the sententious wordsmith, spoke nothing further. Hearing all those words said by Hanuma, that illustrious Rama is well pleased facially, spoke to his brother Lakshmana who is standing at his side. "He is the minister of that noteworthy soul and king of monkeys, Sugreeva... whom alone I cherish, but he has drawn nigh of me, on his own... "Soumitri, with this minister of Sugreeva, the knower of sententiousness and a pleasant worded one, and one with the friendliness you exchange pleasantries with that enemy destroyer Hanuma... "Nay...the non-knower of Rig Veda, or the non-rememberer of Yajur Veda, or the non-scholar of Saama Veda... can, or truly speak this way... "Grammar is severally and comprehensively learned by him... and though much is said by him not a single word has gone amiss of verbiage... "On his face or eyes, or forehead or brows, or other faculties of expression no fault is found...even at the least... "Unexpanded, un-doubtful, un-delaying, and non-dissonant is the tenor of his speech, and it comports in his chest or throat in a medium tone... "He has orderly refinement in speech that is remarkable and un-delaying, and he speaks propitious words that are heart-pleasing... "His speech is generated in three places is enthralling... and whose heart is it that is disenchanted, even that of an enemy after raising his sword at him, on hearing his speech... "Oh, faultless Lakshmana, if this sort of envoy is not there to a king, really how can that king accomplish his ways and means... "Should a king have this kind of work accomplishers with a variety of virtues, all his objectives will be achieved impelled by such an envoy's words..." Rama thus said to Lakshmana. When said thus by Rama, wise-worded Lakshmana spoke to that monkey, and the minister of Sugreeva, namely Hanuma, the son of Air-god, is equally a wise-worded one. "The virtues of that great soul Sugreeva are known to us, oh, scholarly monkey, we for our part are in search of that lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva alone... "As you communicated the words of Sugreeva, oh, gentle Hanuma, by them and by your words we indeed wish to do accordingly... On observing that operative sentence of Lakshmana the monkey Hanuma is gladdened, as seen from his composure, and keeps his mind at ease at the prospective victory, and then he wishes to materialize the pact of friendship between Rama and Sugreeva, at the earliest.Hearing the words of the high-souled Rama, Hanuma reported to Rama, all the words spoken 
by Seetha.
"O Rama the foremost of men! Seetha, the princess, gave a detailed account of an event 
which occurred long ago in Mount Chitrakuta, as a token of recollection."
"Seetha, who slept happily by your side (at one instance) got up before you. A crow coming 
down quickly, tore her flesh at an area amid her breasts (with its beak)."
"O Rama! You slept in your turn on the lap of the princess. That crow again began to 
torment the princess."
"Coming near, again and again, it tore her breast severely. Dampened by her blood, you 
then were awakened by her."
"O tormentator of enemies! Though lying happily asleep, you were awakened by Seetha the 
princess, who was being ceaselessly tormented by the crow."
"O long-armed Rama! Seeing her, who was lacerated in the midst of her breasts, you were 
enraged like a hissing snake and spoke to her as follows."
" 'O bashful Seetha! By whom was the middle of your breasts lacerated with nail-points? 
Who is playing with an angry five-hooded serpent?"
"Looking around, you suddenly saw a crow, which perched in front of Seetha, with its 
sharp nails stained with blood."
"That crow, foremost of the birds was indeed the son of Indra the lord of celestials; 
dwelling in the middle of the mountains and equal in speed to the wind."
"O great armed Rama, the excellent among the wise! With your eyes rolling with anger, 
you then harbored a cruel intention against that crow."
"Taking a blade of grass from your bed of the sacred grass, you charged it with the potency 
of a Brahma missile. That flaming blade blazed forth like the fire of universal dissolution, with its 
end facing the bird."
"You hurled that flaming blade of grass towards the crow. Then that flaming blade of 
grass for its part followed the crow."
"Forsaken by all the celestials, Indra, its father, and the sages too, that crow did not 
find a protector even after going round all the three worlds (heaven, earth, and the lower regions)."
"O destroyer of enemies! Being frightened the crow came to your presence once again and 
sought your protection. Though fit to be killed, you on your part, affording shelter, in mercy to the 
crow, protected that crow which had fallen flat on the ground."
'O Rama! Since it is not possible to make the missile a waste, you destroyed the right 
eye of the crow."
"O Rama! Then, that crow, having been discharged by you, went back to its habitation, 
after offering salutation to you and King Dasaratha."
"O Rama! Why are you not employing the same type of missile on the demons, though you 
are the foremost among the wielders of missiles, though courageous and possessed of good disposition?"
"Neither the Nagas the celestials serpents nor even Gandharvas the celestial musicians 
nor the demons nor the troop of Maruts the host of gods, nor all of them joined together are capable 
of fighting with Rama."
"If that powerful Rama is eager to save me, let him kill Ravana in battle quickly with 
his exceptionally sharp arrows."
"Why even that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries and the foremost of men born 
in Raghu dynasty is not saving me, by taking orders from Rama his brother?"
"Wherefore those two competent brothers Rama and Lakshmana, with their splendor equal 
to that of air and fire, and excellent among men, even though they can conquer the celestials, are ignoring 
me?"
"There is no doubt that I had done some big impure act, for which reason those two brothers 
Rama and Lakshmana, who torment the enemies, even though capable, are not paying attention to me."
Hearing the miserable words of Seetha spoken with tears, I again spoke to that venerable 
Seetha the following words:
" 'O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown indifferent because of grief born of separation 
from you. I swear it to you truly. Rama, being overwhelmed with grief, Lakshmana too is feeling pain."
" 'O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize 
and which can beget happiness to him."
" 'Those two princes, the foremost among men and the faultless ones are eager to see 
you. They can reduce Lanka to ashes."
" 'O lady with charming hips! Killing the terrific Ravana together with his relatives 
in battle, Rama will certainly take you to his City of Ayodhya'."
" 'O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize 
and which can beget happiness to him."
"O mighty Rama! Having surveyed all the directions and having untied from the end of 
her garment, this excellent jewel which was being strung together in her hair that Seetha gave it to 
me."
"O Rama! Taking that wonderful jewel for your sake from her, and offering my salutation 
by bowing my head to that venerable Seetha, I was seized with a haste to come back."
"Seeing me who was in a hurry to come back and augmenting my body abundantly, Seetha 
having a beautiful complexion spoke to me."
"With her eyes filled with tears, looking miserable, with her words ambiguously coming 
out of her coked throat, bewildered as she was, at the thought of my flying away and afflicted with a 
gush of grief; (she spoke to me as follows):
"O Hanuma! Inquire those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana looking like lions, Sugreeva 
together with his ministers and all others about their welfare."
" 'You ought to clear up difficulties for that mighty-armed Rama so that he can help 
me to cross this ocean of sorrow. O best of heroes among monkeys! Approaching Rama, tell this horrible 
gush of my grief and the threats of these female demons. Have a happy journey!' "O illustrious princes, 
the protector of men! The venerable Seetha filled with sorrow spoke these words to be conveyed to you. 
Comprehending this matter spoken by me, believe that Seetha is completely safe."Seeing that highly energetic Ravana, the courageous Hanuma coolly spoke to him the following 
meaningful words:
"O king of demons! By the command of Sugreeva, I came here to your abode. Sugreeva, the 
Lord of Monkeys, your brother, asked me to enquire about your welfare.
"Hear the righteous and meaningful words, as a following advice, of the high-souled Sugreeva, 
your brother, conducive to good in the world as well as in the other world."
"There was a king named Dasaratha, having chariots, elephants, and horses, like a father 
to the people and endowed with a splendor equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials."
"His eldest son named Rama, having mighty arms, a bestower of affection and our lord, 
by the command of his father, abiding in a righteous path, went out on exile and entered a forest called 
Dandaka along with Lakshmana his brother and Seetha his wife."
"Seetha, wife of Rama, devoted to her husband and daughter of the high-souled king, named 
Janaka, the head of Videha kingdom, got lost in the forest."
"That prince, Rama together with his brother, searching for that lady, reached Mount Rishyamuka 
and happened to meet Sugreeva."
"While Sugreeva promised Rama to get Seetha searched, Rama too promised to get the kingdom 
of monkeys to Sugreeva."
"Thereafter, killing Vali in combat, Rama installed Sugreeva on the throne as a lord 
of that troop monkeys and bears."
"You may indeed know Vali, the foremost among monkeys, previously. Rama killed that Vali 
with a single arrow in battle."
"Sugreeva, the lord of monkeys, true to his promise, was intent on searching for Seetha 
and sent his monkeys to all directions."
"Hundreds, thousands, and lakhs of monkeys are searching for her in all quarters, as also 
below and above in the sky."
"Among those monkeys, some mighty and virile monkeys are similar to Garuda the eagle. 
Some are like the wind, swiftly going with an unhindered movement."
"I am, however, an own son of wind-god and named as Hanuma. I came here even by crossing 
quickly the ocean, which is a hundred yojanas (or eight hundred miles) wide for the sake of Seetha and 
wishing to see her."
"While strolling around in the city of Lanka, I found Seetha in your abode. You know 
about religious merit and wealth. You performed and mastered the austerities. That is why, you ought 
not besiege the wife of another, O great intellectual!"
"Intellectuals like you indeed are not engrossed in acts, which are antagonistic to righteousness, 
which are attended with many dangers and which even ruin the doer at the roots."
"Who is capable even among celestials and demons, to withstand the arrows discharged 
by Lakshmana, in the wake of the fury of Rama?
"O king! No one is known in the three worlds, who have gained happiness, by doing harm 
to Rama."
"That is why, accede to my words, which are beneficial for all the three divisions of 
time (viz. the past, present, and future), resulting in affluence and respectability as well. Let Seetha 
be restored to Rama."
"I beheld Seetha, the princess. The audience of Seetha is difficult to achieve and 
it is obtained here. It is for Rama there to decide his remaining task of future consequence."
"Capturing Seetha, whom you do not recognize as a five-hooded female serpent in your 
abode, has been found by me in that manner, and wholly given over to sorrow."
"She is incapable of being devoured with one's might even by celestials and demons, any 
more than food mixed with abundant poison could be digested with one's digestive power if consumed."
"It is not proper for you to lose your exceptional longevity and that fortune which is 
an outcome of your virtue, both of which have been acquired by you through the practice of austerities."
"You may be thinking that you are immune from death from demons and celestials, because 
of your austerities. But your opinion in that matter is not correct, on account of the following reasons.
"This Sugreeva is indeed neither a god, nor Asura the chief of evil spirits nor a demon 
nor a child of Danu the demon, nor Gandharva the celestial musician nor Yaksha the semi-divine being 
nor Pannaga the serpent-demon. O King! How do you protect your life from him?"
"The fruit of righteousness does not exist together with the result of unrighteousness 
(even though he practices virtue). That consequence of unrighteousness alone follows him. Righteousness 
in abundance destroys unrighteousness."
"You already obtained the fruit of virtue till now. There is no doubt about it. In no 
time, you will obtain the fruit of unrighteousness also."
"Recognizing the killing of demons in the forest of Janasthana, about the killing of 
Vali and about the friendship between Rama and Sugreeva, realize your interest."
"I am indeed, even alone, undoubtedly, destroying Lanka, along with its horses, chariots, and elephants. However, this is not by the resolution of Rama."
"For, Rama, indeed, promised in the presence of troops of monkeys and bears, about the 
extermination of enemies, by whom Seetha was laid violent hands upon."
"Even Indra the Lord of Celestials, in person, cannot attain happiness if he does any 
harm to Rama. How much move to another person like you?"
"Know her, whom you recognize as Seetha and who stays in your captivity, to be none else 
than Kalaratri (the goddess presiding over and responsible for dissolution), who can destroy the entire 
Lanka."
"Therefore, have it enough of this noose of death, in the form of Seetha's personality, 
which has been placed by yourself around your neck. Think well of your safety."
"See; (in the immediate future), this city of Lanka, burnt away by the effulgence of 
Seetha and the City too being scorched with its markets and main streets, afflicted by the wrath of 
Rama."
"Do not lead to extermination your friends, counselors, kinsmen, brothers, sons, 
well-wishers, enjoyments, wives, and Lanka."
"O king of demons! Listen to my truthful words coming as it is from the lips of this 
servant of Rama, his messenger, and particularly of this monkey."
"The renowned Rama is capable of destroying all the worlds together with its 
five elements, along with its animate and inanimate things, and also to create yet again all the worlds 
in like manner as before."
"The renowned Rama, who is equal in prowess to Vishnu the lord of the preservation and 
among celestials, demons, or the foremost of men, or hordes of Yakshas the semi-divine beings or 
ogres or among all Vidyadharas, a king of super-natural beings or among Gandharvas the celestials musicians 
or among Uragas the semi-divine serpents or among Siddhas the holy personages having supernatural powers 
or among excellent Kinnaras the mythical beings with human figures and the head of a horse or among all types 
of birds or among all living beings at all places and at all times."
"After doing great harm in this manner to Rama the lord of all worlds as well as the 
lion among kings, your survival will be difficult."
"O king of demons! Either celestials or demons or Gandharvas the celestial musicians 
or Vidyadharas a king of super-natural beings Nagas the semi-divine serpents or Yakshas the semi 
divine beings-all of them are not able to stand before Rama the lord of the three worlds."
"Either Brahma the self-existing god with four faces or Rudra with three eyes and the 
destroyer of Tripura (the city built of gold, silver, and iron in the sky, air, and earth, by Maya for 
the demons and burnt by Shiva), or Mahendra the god of atmosphere and sky as also the lord of celestials 
would not be able to protect the one to be killed by Rama in battle."
Hearing those unpleasant words endowed with extreme skillfulness and which were spoken 
without fear from Hanuma, that unequaled Ravana ordered the killing of that Hanuma."I am indeed hearing a delight mention of my lord, who proceeded to the vast forest
so many years ago.
"This common saying sounds to me good, that bliss comes to a surviving man, even if
it be after a hundred years!"
"How and on what ground, an alliance has been concluded between Rama and the monkeys
and at what place? Tell the truth to me, enquiring as I am."
Seated comfortably on a cushion and interrogated by Bharata, Hanuma thereupon began
to narrate the entire exploits of Rama in the forest.
"O Lord, the long-armed! How your mother was conferred with two boons by your
father, how Rama was sent to exile, how Dasaratha the king died, with a shocking sorrow for his
son's exile, how you were brought quickly from Rajagriha (the seat of government of Kekaya kings)
by the envoys, how sovereignty was not coveted by you when you returned to Ayodhya, how on your
going to mount Chitrakuta, your, elder brother the tormentator of enemies was invited by you who
followed righteousness to take back the kingdom, how Rama who stood by his father's words,
renounced the kingdom and stood by his father's words, renounced the kingdom and how your returned
to Ayodhya, taking with you the wooden sandals all this is known accurately to you. Hear from me
now, that which occurred after you had returned to Ayodhya."
"When you had gone away, that forest (of Chitrakuta) then assumed a very miserable
appearance, with the frightened animals and birds (on seeing strange people there)."
"Rama, thereupon, entered that large, terrific and solitary forest of Dandaka, which
had been trampled by elephants and extensive with lions, tigers and deers."
"In front of them, even as they were going in that dense forest, there appeared
Viradha, a demon, uttering forth a very loud roar.
"They cast him, who rushed with uplifted arms towards them, into a pit, turning his
head bent low, and who was emitting a loud cry, like an elephant."
"Carrying out that ardous task, Rama and Lakshmana, both the brothers, went to the
beautiful hermitage of Sharbhanga, in that evening.
"Offering salutation to all the hermits when Sharabhanga ascended to heaven, Rama
who truly mighty, reached the region of Janasthana."
"Thereafter, a female-demon called Surpanakha sought the presence of Rama. As
ordered by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana thereupon rose quickly and seizing a sword, chopped off her
ears and nose."
"Fourteen thousand demons, inhabiting Janasthana-region, were killed by the
great-souled Rama, while sojourning that region."
"The demons, who came together at the battle-front, were wholly finished by Rama
alone, in a fraction of a quarter of a day."
"The demons who were the mighty inhabitants of Dandaka-forest, who were causing
obstacles to the austerity of the ascetics, were killed by Rama."
"The demons were smashed in the battle. Khara (their leader) also was killed. After
killing Dushana (his brother) first, Trishira (the other brother) was killed thereafter."
"Tormented by the incident of destruction of demons, the foolish Surpanakha sought
refuge with Ravana. Disguised in the form of a deer studded with precious stones, a terrific demon
by name, Maricha, a follower of Ravana, allured Seetha."
"That Seetha, on seeing it, told Rama, 'Let this deer be caught. Our hermitage will
turn out to be charming and pleasing to the eye'."
"Thereupon, Rama wielding a bow in his arm, chased that deer and killed that running
one, with an arrow of curved knots."
"O good sir! While Rama was chasing the deer and even when Lakshmana had gone out,
Ravana forthwith entered their hermitage during that interval."
"Ravana, the demon, seized Seetha, even as a planet like Mars would obscure the
constellation, Rohini. Having killed a vulture named Jatayu, who sought to deliver her, Ravana then
went quickly in haste, taking Seetha with him"
"Then, in surprise, some monkeys who was staying on a mountain-peak, looking like
mountain, saw, with astonishment writ large in their faces, Ravana the king of demons, passing that
way, taking away Seetha."
"Going still faster and ascending along with Seetha, the aerial car, Pushpaka, which
was as swift as thought, the mighty Ravana the king of demons thereupon entered the City of
Lanka."
"Conducting that Seetha into a large beautiful mansion, embellished with gold, that
Ravana sought to cajole her gently with his words."
"Caring a straw for that Ravana and his talk, Seetha, later, actually remained in
Ashoka-grove."
"Having killed that deer, Rama while returning to the hermitage, saw the vulture
(Jatayu) in the forest. Rama was greatly disturbed. Seeing the vulture (Jatayu) who was dearer to
him than his own father killed, Rama was disturbed."
"While searching for Seetha, RAma along with Lakshmana strolled after blossomed
woodlands along the bank of Godavari-river."
"They met, in that great forest, a demon by name Kabandha. Then according to the
advice of Kabandha, Rama of true prowess met Sugreeva, after heading for Mount Rishyamuka."
"Even before they met, a meeting of hearts through affinity, had taken place between
them. Sugreeva had been banished in the past by the enraged Vali, his elder brother and as a result
of mutual talks, affection deeply arose between Rama and Sugreeva."
"Having killed with the strength of his arms in combat, the mighty Vali with a
colossal body, Rama caused the kingdom of Sugreeva restored.
"Sugreeva, who was established in his kingdom with all, his monkeys, had given his
pledge to Rama, to commence a search for Seetha the princess."
"Ten crores of monkeys were accordingly commanded by the great-souled Sugreeva and
sent to all the four quarters."
"Having lost our way in Vindhya, the foremost of mountain-ranges, a long time
slipped past us and we felt sore-stricken with sorrow."
"Meanwhile, the brother of Jatayu (the king of vultures), Sampati by name, precisely
communicated to us that Seetha was dwelling in the habitation of Ravana."
"Removing the grief of my kinsfolk, who were seized with sorrow, I, as such, crossed
one hundred yojanas (eight hundred miles of the ocean), resorting to my own strength."
"There, I saw Seetha, living alone in a grove of Ashoka trees, clad in a soiled
silk-saree, looking cheerless, but unflinching in her vow."
"After meeting her and duly enquiring that faultless Seetha, everything of her, a
ring with the name, Rama engraved on it, was handed-over to her by me as a token."
"Receiving in return from her, a jewel (from her head), I came back to the northern
shore, successful as I was in my undertaking. On my return, that brilliant and valuable jewel was
given by me as a token to Rama who was unweary in action."
"On hearing the news of Seetha, Rama for his part regained the hope to survive, as a
dying patient would, on drinking the ambrosia."
"Excited as he was to put forth a war-effort, he set his mind on the destruction of
Lanka, as the fire-god intending to destroy all the three worlds, would, at the end of the
universe."
"Then, on reaching the ocean, he got a bridge constructed by Nala and through that
bridge, the army of the valiant monkeys crossed the ocean."
"Neela killed Prahasta. Rama, the scion of Raghu dynasty, personally killed
Kumbhakarna and Ravana. Lakshmana killed Indrajit, the son of Ravana."
"The illustrious Rama, the destroyer of enemies, happened to meet Indra the lord of
celestials, Yama the lord of dissolution, Varuna the lord of waters, Maheshvara, the great lord
(Shiva), Brahma the lord of creation as also Dasaratha (his deceased father) and was bestowed boons
by them. Sages and celestial masters who came there, too gave boons."
"Having been granted boons, Rama for his part flew to Kishkindha in an aerial car
called Pushpaka, along with the monkeys who gathered there."
"Reaching the coast-line of Ganga-river again, Rama is staying in the presence of
the sage, Bharadwaja. Tomorrow, when the moon will be in conjunction with the asteroid, Pushya you
will be able to see Rama, without any obstacle."
"Gladdened to hear Rama's impending return to Ayodhya in the sweet words of Hanuma,
Bharata offered his salutation by joining his palms together and spoke the following words, which
enraptured his mind: 'My desire has been fulfilled indeed after a long time'."That Hanuma, the strong one, saw a group of houses with windows in golden hue,
embedded with cat's-eye gems, like a great group of clouds in the rainy season with lighting, together
with a group of birds.
Hanuma saw various halls of the houses, important buildings storing conches, bows,
and other weapons, and also heartening spacious attics at the top of mountain-like houses.
Hanuma saw houses glittered with various riches, well worshipped by Devas and Asuras,
devoid of all flaws, and obtained by the self-might of rakshasas.
Hanuma saw those houses of the ruler of Lanka, constructed by a great effort as though
constructed by Maya himself on earth with all the best qualities.
Thereafter Hanuma saw the best house of the lord of rakshasas, having the appearance
of a cloud, soul-captivating one having a beautiful form made of gold which has no comparison,
suitable of Ravana's might
Hanuma saw Ravana's house like heaven thrown upon earth, effulgent with glory,
embedded with a variety of diamonds covered by flowers of various trees, like the summit of a
mountain covered by pollen.
Being shone by the best among women like a cloud by lightening, being worshipped,
like being carried by the best swans, like an aerial car full of splendor, of good people in
sky.
Hanuma saw the best house as a beautiful cloud endowed with many hues, like the
sky illumined by planets including the moon, decked with numerous precious stones like a mountain
peak, looking picturesque with numerous minerals.
The earth was made to be full of mountain ranges. The mountains were made to be
abounded by trees. The trees were made to be full of flowers. The flower was made to be full of
filaments and petals.
White mansions were also built in the same way. Lakes also with beautiful flowers
and also lotuses together with filaments and forest that were the best and wonderful.
There the great Hanuma saw a great aerial car, the best among the best of aerial cars,
shining with the name of Pushpaka with the rays of precious stones, and capable of traveling long
distances.
Artificial birds made of cat's-eye gems, as well as birds made of silver and coral,
wonderful serpents made of various jewels, horses of beautiful limbs suitable by their noble breed
were arranged.
Birds were made with corals on their wings and together with golden flowers, with
good wings, with curved and bent wings in a playful way, shining like helpers of the god of love
himself
Images of elephants in a lotus pool with filaments of lotus on the body, with lotus
petals held in their trunks, were devoted to the worship of an image of Goddess Lakshmi. Also,
an image of Goddess Lakshmi with four graceful hands and holding a lotus in Her hand was made to
exist in Pushpaka.
In this fashion, nearing that house which was shining like a mountain with a
beautiful glow that house with great sweet fragrance like a beautiful mountain during spring, with
the beautiful cave became surprised and saw (again).
Thereafter that Hanuma nearing the city of Lanka worshipped by Rakshasas, ruled by
arms of ten-headed Ravana, moving thereabout became very gloomy on not seeing that Seetha well
worshipped by all and greatly conquered by the virtues of Her husband Sri Rama
Thereafter then the heart of the great-souled Hanuma who contemplated supreme spirit
in many ways with a disciplined mind following the righteous path, with good observant eyes, moving
about in the city of Lanka became greatly sorrowful on not seeing Seetha.
Thus, this is the th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.Thereafter the moon with a peaceful rise, with radiance equaling that of a group of lotuses, obtained 
the clear sky like a swan obtaining blue water.
That moon with a peaceful glow served Hanuma with cool rays as though performing help with radiance.
Thereafter Hanuma saw Seetha with a face like a full moon, put down by the weight of grief, like 
a ship sinking in water due to weight.
Hanuma wanting to see Seetha saw nearby ogresses with horrible appearances - one with one eye; one 
with a single ear and also one with ears as covering; one with conch shell-like ears; one with fattened nose up 
to head; one with lean and long neck; one with disheveled hair and also one without hair; one with blanket-like 
hair; one with hanging stomach and breasts; one with hanging face; one with lips at chin; one with hanging face; 
one with hanging knees; one who is short; one who is tall and also hunchbacked; one who is distorted; a dwarf 
one and also one with high teeth one with a crooked mouth, one with green eyes, and one with a horrible face.
Hanuma saw horrible ogresses, dark-complexioned ones, angry ones, those who like quarrels, ones 
wearing big darts, mallets, and clubs of iron, with faces like those of pigs, deer, tigers, buffaloes, goats, she-foxes, 
with feet like those of elephants, camels, and horses, with heads sunk into bodies, with a single hand and a single foot, 
those ears like that of donkeys and horses, those with cow ears, those with elephant ears, those with monkey ears, 
and some others without noses, those with horizontal noses, those with crooked noses, those with elephant-like noses, 
toes with nose fixed on the forehead, with feet like those of an elephant, those with big feet, those with cow-like feet, 
those with hair on their feet, those with big heads and necks, those with big nipples and big stomachs, those with 
big eyes and mouths, with long tongues and nails, and also the face like that of a she-goat, those with elephant 
like face, those with face like that of a cow, those with face of a she-pig, those with faces like those of horses, 
camels, donkeys, those with horrible appearance, ogresses carrying pikes and clubs in their hand, angry ones, 
those who like quarrels, those with high teeth, with hair color like that of smoke, with horrible faces, always 
drinking liquor, always desiring meat and liquor, with body smeared by meat and blood, with meat and blood as 
food, whose appearance made the hair stand up, sitting around a great tree with a huge trunk.
Hanuma the glorious one saw that Seetha, the princess, daughter of Janaka, unblemished one below 
that tree.
She was lackluster being tormented by grief, with hair covered by dirt, with merits exhausted, 
like a star fell from the heavens onto the ground.
She was rich with the fame of lofty character, poor due to not seeing her husband, lacking excellent ornaments, 
with husband's love as an ornament.
Being held captive by Ravana, without any relatives, She was like a she-elephant without herd, 
being detained by a lion.
She was like the moon being covered by clouds at the end of the rainy season with an appearance lacking 
luster due to lack of contact with their husband, was like an unplucked Veena.
Hanuma saw Seetha being suited to be with her husband, in the custody of ogresses, in the middle 
of Ashoka Garden being immersed in an ocean of grief
Hanuma saw Seetha there surrounded by those ogresses, like Rohini with planets, like a creeper 
without flowers.
With body smeared with dirt, being graced by Her body, that Seetha shone and also did not shine, 
like a lotus fiber covered with dirt.
The monkey Hanuma saw that Seetha with a great beauty with black eyes, covered by a cloth that was 
creased and dirty, with eyes of a deer, with a pitiful face, not depressed due to the brilliance of her husband, 
protected by her character.
Hanuma became happy on seeing Seetha with the eyes of a fawn, fearful like a she-deer, seeing trees 
with young shoots, as though being burnt by sighs, like a bundle of grief, with a wave of sorrow risen.
Hanuma the son of the wind god on seeing Seetha that Seetha is like the goddess of earth, with well-divided 
body parts shining even without ornaments obtained great joy.
Hanuma on seeing Seetha there with intoxicating eyes shed tears of joy and also paid obeisance 
to Sri Rama.
Being joyful on seeing Seetha, Hanuma the mighty one paid obeisance to Sri Rama and Lakshmana 
and became covered with leaves.
That Hanuma being there, seeing and searching for Seetha, observing all that land, explored 
	the garden.
That Hanuma being there observed closely in the Ashoka garden shone by Santanaka creepers, Santana 
	trees with heavenly aroma and juice, well decorated in all directions equalling the garden of Nandana, surrounded 
	by animals and birds, congested with mansions and palaces, resounded with the notes of cuckoos, decorated 
	with wells having golden water lilies, lotuses and with many chairs and carpets; with many sub-terrain houses, 
	beautiful trees, with trees with flowers of all seasons and with fruit, with the radiance of rising sun, 
	by the glory of Ashoka trees in bloom, as though radiant as though being made to be with branches without 
	leaves, by hundreds of birds perching, again and again, Ashoka trees with wonderful flowers as head decoration, 
	with flowers spread till the roots destroying leaves, with the weight of groups of flowers as touching the earth 
	with karnolaara trees; in blossom with Kimkusa trees in full blossom.
By the radiance of those trees that region was as though lit in all directions. Punnaaga trees 
	with flatted roots and in full blossom, Saptaparna trees Campaka and Uddalaka trees were shining.
There in that garden of Ashoka, there were thousands of Ashoka trees some equalling gold, some 
	equalling fire, some equalling the precious stones Niila and Anjana.
Like the garden of Nandana, a celestial garden, wonderful like Caitraratham, a garden of Kubera, 
	surpassing all, unfathomable, an excellent one, a beautiful one consisting of glory together with flowers 
	like clusters of stars, like a second sky wonderful with flowers, like hundreds of diamonds, like a second 
	ocean with flowers of all seasons, spread with trees having the smell of honey, beautiful with groups of animals 
	of various sounds, diffused with many smells with an auspicious soul-pleasing smell.
That monkey warrior Hanuma saw not far away in that Ashoka garden, in the middle, a lofty temple 
	filled with fragrance like a second Gandhamadana Mountain, standing by a thousand pillars, white like Mount 
	Kailaasa with stairs made of corals with platforms made of refined gold as though radiant with glory, clear 
	and because of being tall as though scraping the sky.
Thereafter Hanuma saw Seetha wearing a soiled garment, surrounded by rakshasa women, emaciated 
	due to fasting, looking miserable, sighing again and again, like the pure crescent moon at the beginning of 
	a bright fortnight.
With a form that slowly came out like a tongue of fire, of beautiful radiance covered by smoke.
Covered by a single best cloth of yellow colour, which was wrinkled, without any decorations 
	like a lotus plant without lotuses, together with mud.
Bashful, tortured by sorrow worn out in a pitiable condition like the constellation Rohini, 
	pressed by the planet Mars.
With a face full of tears in a pitiable condition, emaciated due to not taking food, immersed 
	in thought with gloom, always in a pitiable state, surrendering to sorrow.
Not seeing dear people, seeing groups of demonesses, like a female deer losing her herd 
	surrounded by a group of hounds.
With a braid with the radiance of a single black serpent reaching the hinder part, like the earth 
	with dark green groups of trees during the end of the rainy season, deserving of comforts, tormented by grief, 
	not accustomed to calamities.
Observing that woman with wide eyes, very untidy, and emaciated, Hanuma thought that this was indeed 
	Seetha on logical grounds.
Then, while being abducted by that rakshasa with the ability to assume the desired form in whatever 
	way, She was seen, this woman has the same form.
Hanuma saw Seetha with a face like a full moon, with beautiful eyebrows, with graceful rounded 
	breasts, by the radiance, making all directions without darkness, goddess-like with black hair, with lips like 
	bimba fruit, with a good waist, very firm, with eyes like lotus petals, like Rati the consort of the god of love.
As the light of full moon, dear to all the world, like an ascetic woman leading an austere life sitting 
	on bare ground with a good body.
Sighing a lot like the consort of lord of serpents in fright, not radiant by sorrow which was 
	great and extensive.
Hanuma saw Her like a tongue of fire mixed with a column of smoke, like an intellect together 
	with doubts, like a castaway treasure.
Like shattered faith, like frustrated hope, like success together with obstacles, like an impure 
	mind.
Like fame that has fallen by a false scandal, tortured by the obstruction caused to Rama, 
	emaciated due to the abduction by Ravana.
With eyes like those of a young doe full of tears, with black and oblique eye-brows, with a 
	cheerless countenance, seeing here and there, being helpless, sighing again and again.
Wearing a coat of dust, pitiable one, although suited for decorations undecorated, like the 
	radiance of the moon, the lord of stars, covered by black clouds.
Seeing Seetha like knowledge in ruin for want of repeated study, that Hanuma's mind repeatedly 
	doubtful.
Hanuma recognized with great sorrow Seetha was not decorated, like a sentence which got a different 
	meaning being devoid of culture.
Seeing that princess, the wide-eyed one, blameless one, Hanuma reasoned her to be Seetha for 
	the following reasons.
Then Hanuma saw whatever groups of jewellery of Seetha on various parts, Rama spoke, those charming 
	Her limbs, well-made earrings, well-fitting Svadamstras and ornaments wonderful with diamonds on the limbs 
	of Her hands, belonging to her body for a long time, blackened and made marks on her body.
"I think all these to be same about which Rama spoke; among them whatever have been worn out 
	those I will not see; whatever jewels of Her are not worn out these are they - no doubt."
That upper garment yellow with a shine like a golden plate, an auspicious one, being dropped had 
	been seen caught in a tree then by Banaras.
"Dropped on the earth by Her, ornaments also great and important, those making sound have been 
	seen."
"This cloth is worn for a long time has worn out a lot, even then definitely it is of the 
	same colour, like the other upper garment; in the same way this is glorious."
"This She of golden colour is indeed Rama's dear wife; whoever Seetha the chaste one, even 
	though not seen, is not gone from Rama's heart."
"This is She for whose sake Rama tormented in four ways from compassion from pity from grief 
	from love; (thinking that) a woman has disappeared from compassion, depending on him from pity, the wife has been 
	lost from grief, a dear one from love."
"In whatever way is this lady's appearance, the elegance of major and minor limbs, in the same 
	way, is Rama's. In whatever way His appearance, in the same way, is this black-eyed one's appearance."
"This lady's heart is in Rama, His heart is firmly in Her, for that reason She and that noble 
	Rama can live even for a moment."
"Lord Rama losing Her has done an impossible task in that He still preserved His body, in that 
	He did not die from grief."
Hanuma, then seeing Seetha became happy thus and went by mind to Rama and also praised that 
	Lord.Then, Hanuma with a terrific prowess, was enraged (at his capture and his being dragged) 
and saw Ravana with his red hot eyes. He was surprised by that deed of Indrajit.
Ravana was endowed with a great splendor and shone with a glittering and precious diadem 
of gold as also encircled with strings of pearls.
That Ravana was adorned with bright-coloured gold ornaments, inlaid with diamonds and 
decorated with worthy gems, which appeared as though they were prepared with the mind.
Ravana was attired in very costly silk and his body was smeared with red-sandal paste 
and well painted with various brightly coloured designs.
Ravana looked strange with his ten heads, having terrible-looking yet good-looking pair 
of red eyes each, with brilliant sharp enormous teeth and protruding lips, like a daring demon endowed 
with extra ordinary vigour, shining brightly as Mount Mandara with its peaks and infested with snakes 
of different varieties.
Ravana was having a pearl necklace casting its splendor on his bosom. He was looking 
like a mass of blue antimony, but with his countenance shining like the full moon and appearing like 
a cloud illumined by the rising sun.
Ravana was distinguished by (twenty) arms, adorned with bracelets, smeared with excellent 
sandal-paste and decked with shining Angadas another variety of bracelets and looking like large five-hooded 
serpents.
He was comfortably seated on a big excellent throne of crystal, rendered picturesque 
by being embedded with jewels and overspread with an exquisite covering.
He was duly waited upon at close quarters on all sides by young ladies, well-adorned 
and with whisks in their hands.
He was proud of his might and had four counselors sitting nearby, all belonging to the 
demonical race and who knew the secret of good counsel, viz. Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva the demon 
and the counselor Nikumbha and looked like the entire terrestrial globe enclosed by four oceans.
He was being reassured by counselors knowing the secret of good counsel and other demons 
with auspicious minds, as Indra the lord of celestials is reassured by celestials.
Hanuma saw Ravana with a great splendor, sitting on the throne, looking like a rainy 
cloud on the peak of Mount Meru.
Though tortured by the demons that Hanuma, of terrific prowess, experiencing a great 
surprise, looked attentively at Ravana.
Seeing the glittering Ravana, the king of demons, Hanuma was bewildered by his splendor 
and thought in his mind as follows:
"What figure, what courage, what strength, what splendor and what amalgam of auspicious 
marks, alas, this king of demons has!"
"Had this lord of demons perhaps not strong in unrighteousness, he would have been a 
protector of even the world of celestials together with Indra the lord of celestials."
"By his cruel and violent acts despised by the world, all people including gods and demons 
indeed remain frightened of him. If enraged he is indeed capable to turn the entire world into a single 
ocean."
Seeing the power of Ravana the king of demons, who possessed an unlimited vigour, the 
intelligent Hanuma formulated many kinds of thoughts in this way.That Hanuma with great resplendence thought for a moment, obtained that Ashoka garden by mind and 
jumped from the compound wall of that house.
That great Hanuma with joyful limbs, being on enclosure wall saw various trees such as Sal, beautiful 
Ashoka, Champaka full of flowers, Uddalaka, Naga, mango trees with their fruit in the colour of the snout of a 
monkey, in full blossom at the start of the spring.
Thereafter Hanuma flew like a Naracha arrow released from bow string, toward the garden covered 
by mango trees and surrounded by hundreds of creepers.
That Hanuma the simian, saw on entering that garden filled with happy humans, animals and birds 
with varied hues during spring, resounded by birds, with trees made of silver, made of gold, surrounded everywhere 
by birds and groups of animals; wonderful with wonderful trees equaling the Sun at sunrise together with trees 
of various kinds which obtained flowers and fruits, served daily by Cuckoos and by dragon flies, resounded by 
peacocks in heat and with groups of birds of various kinds.
Hanuma searching the royal daughter Seetha with excellent limbs and without blame, woke up birds 
in comfortable sleep.
Trees hit by wings of groups of birds in flight shed showers of flowers of various colours and 
of various kinds.
The son of Lord Vayu, Hanuma sprinkled with flowers shone like a mountain of flowers in the middle 
of Ashoka garden.
Seeing Hanuma running in all directions and being in the middle of trees, all living creatures 
thought Him to be Vasanta, the lord of spring.
There the Earth sprinkled by flowers of various kinds which fell down from trees shone like a well 
decorated woman.
Then those trees, shaken by the might of Hanuma the mighty one, showered wonderful flowers.
The trees with their branches, removed leaves with fallen down fruits and flowers were like defeated 
gamblers with their clothes and jewellery kept down.
The excellent trees shining with best flowers fell down instantly flowers, leaves and fruits.
All those trees losing groups of birds became being a resort to branches only like trees shook 
by wind.
Hit by Hanuma's tail, hands and feet, Ashoka garden with broken best trees became like a young 
woman with disturbed hair, with effaced sandal paste, with her auspicious teeth and lips drunk from and wounded 
by nails and by teeth.
Hanuma broke circles of great creepers by His might like the wind during rainy season, breaking 
the groups of clouds of mountain Vindhya.
That Hanuma pacing there saw diamond studded floors, silver inlaid floors, and beautiful gold inlaid 
floors.
Hanuma saw ponds filled with the best waters, together there and there with stairs embedded with 
diamonds of great value, with pearls and corals as sand, with bottoms made of crystal and precious stones, shone 
by trees of golden hue and of wonderful hue at banks containing beds of lotuses in full blossom and lilies, resounded 
by chakravaka birds nearby, sounded by water fowls, resounded by swans and cranes, together with tall trees, with 
nectar like waters, with hundreds of auspicious creepers, covered by the flowers of santaana trees, surrounded 
by various shrubs with middle regions of karaveera and also wells and in various shapes.
Thereafter the monkey warrior Hanuma saw a mountain which was a beautiful mountain in the world, 
equaling cloud with high peaks, with wonderful peaks surrounded in all directions by peaks, spread by caves and 
covered by different trees.
Hanuma saw river which fell down from the mountain like a beloved (young wife) who fell down after 
jumping from the lap of a loved one shone by trees whose ends fell down in water or like a woman in anger being 
detained by her near and dear. That great Hanuma again saw that river with water, turning back like a beloved 
woman reaching her beloved again, being reconciled to her beloved one.
The best among vanaras and the son of Vayu, that Hanuma saw near to that mountain, lotus ponds 
together with many groups of birds.
He also saw an artificial pond filled with cold water, with steps embedded with best diamonds, 
shone by the sand of pearls, wonderful forest with very big buildings made by Vishwakarma, with groups of artificial 
trees decorated in all directions.
There whatever trees were there with flowers and fruits, all those were together with umbrellas, 
together with big platforms and with smaller golden platforms.
The monkey warrior Hanuma saw one shimshupaa tree golden in colour covered with many groups of 
creepers and with many leaves surrounded everywhere with platforms made of gold.
Hanuma saw lands, mountain springs, and some other golden trees equal to fire.
Then the courageous Hanuma thought thus: "Like the sun by the radiance of Mount Meru, by the radiance 
of those trees, I am of golden colour."
Seeing that shimshupaa tree with groups of trees of golden colour blown by the wind, with the sound 
of hundreds of tinkle bells, Hanuma got surprised.
Hanuma with great arms climbing up that shimshupaa tree with well flowered ends, beautiful tree, 
mature with young shoots and leaves and covered by leaves (thought thus).
"I will see by God's grace, Seetha who is interested in the sight of Sri Rama while she is moving 
here and there with grief."
This Ashoka garden of evil-souled Ravana is definitely beautiful; it is well decorated by Champaka 
trees, by sandal trees and by Vakula trees.
"This pond also served by groups of birds is beautiful; that wife of Sri Rama definitely will come 
for this pond."
"The wife of Sri Rama dear to Sri Rama, a chaste wife, soul captivating one, expert at moving in 
forest, that Janaki will definitely come."
"Otherwise one with the eyes of a deer, emaciated by the thought of Sri Rama, that noble one will 
come for this garden."
"Tortured by grief for Sri Rama, with beautiful eyes, interested always living in the garden, that 
Devi moving about in the garden will come."
"The beloved wife of Sri Rama, the daughter of king Janaka, the chaste wife, earlier always was 
interested the denizens of the garden. This is true."
"The ever youthful one with the best complexion, Seetha interested in the rites of Sandhya time 
will definitely come to this river with the auspicious water for Sandhya rite."
"Whoever Seetha, the auspicious wife, a dear one of Sri Rama, the king of kings, to that Seetha 
this Ashoka garden, an auspicious one, is well suited also."
"That Devi with the face like that of the moon, if alive, she definitely will come for this river 
with auspicious water."
The great-souled Hanuma thus thinking being concealed in the mass of well flowered leaves saw everything 
observing everywhere.Hanuma the leader of Vanaras crossed from Pushpaka toward the fort wall and became speed-like 
lighting in the middle of a cloud.
The simian Hanuma went far from the house of Ravana and not seeing Seetha, the daughter of King 
Janaka said these words:
"The city of Lanka has been mostly explored by me attempting for the pleasure of Rama. But I am 
unable to see Seetha, beautiful in all limbs, and the daughter of Videha."
"All earth consisting of pools, ponds, lakes and streams, rivers and forest areas filled with water, 
mountains difficult of access have been explored but I did not see Seetha."
"It has been said by the eagle King Sampati that Seetha is here in the house of Ravana. I am unable 
to see her."
"Otherwise Seetha belonging to Videha born in Mithila and daughter of king Janaka - Can she be 
helplessly together with the evil-minded Ravana."
"I think while Ravana fearing Rama's arrows flew quickly carrying Seetha, she might have fallen 
down in the middle of the journey."
"Or I think the heart of the noble Seetha being stolen in the path served by Siddhas must have 
sunk at the site of the ocean."
"I think due to the great speed of Ravana and due to the torture of Ravana's shoulders life has 
been given up by that noble one with wide eyes."
"Then while being flown upon the surface of the ocean, Seetha definitely fell in the ocean 
while wriggling."
"Or has the austere Seetha been eaten by this Ravana, the evil-minded one while she was protecting 
her chastity without any relatives near her."
"Otherwise not being evil with black eyes, She may have been eaten by the wives of Ravana with 
evil thoughts."
"The pitiable Seetha equaling full moon, with eyes equaling lotus petals must have obtained death 
while meditating upon Rama's face."
"The daughter of Videha, Seetha.  O Rama!'  O Lakshmana!'  O Ayodhya!', thus weeping greatly may 
have given up her body."
"I think otherwise being put in the house of Ravana Seetha is crying like a caged myna."
"How can the daughter of King Janaka, Rama's wife Seetha with a beautiful waist, with eyes like 
black lotus petals obtain Ravana's capture."
"It is not fair to let know Rama who has a dear wife if Seetha is lost or is not to be seen or 
has died."
"To be let known becomes an error; not to let know becomes an error how to perform the duty? To 
me this seems dire situation."
"This task while it goes this way the time is approaching. What becomes appropriate" Thus Hanuma 
thought again this viewpoint.
"If I go towards Sugreeva's city from here without seeing Seetha from that to what avail will this 
effort be?"
"My crossing of the ocean entering the city of Lanka the site of rakshasas - all this will become 
waste."
"To me reaching Kishkindha what would Sugreeva say or Vanaras there or those sons of Dasharatha 
what would they say?"
"Going there by me for Rama,  Seetha has not been seen - thus if I say a very unpleasant word 
thereafter Rama will give up life."
"Hearing bad words belonging to Seetha that are harsh, horrible, cruel, sharp, sense agonizing, He 
will not exist."
"Seeing that Rama being with troubles, being with a heart towards death, Lakshmana, one with great 
love and an intellectual will not exist."
"Hearing brothers to be dead, Bharata also will die. Seeing the dead Bharata, Shatrughana also 
will not exist."
"Thereafter seeing sons be dead the mothers Kausalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi will not exist - there 
is no doubt."
"Grateful, true to pledge Sugreeva, the leader of Vanaras, seeing Rama the leader of Vanaras seeing 
Rama dies in that way and will give up life thereafter."
"Being tortured by the sorrow of husband, made sad by a gloomy heart, disconsolate without happiness, 
to be pitied, Ruma will give up life."
"Being distressed from the sorrow of Vali, being emaciated from grief, Tara also will not exist 
while the king Sugreeva is obtaining death."
"The young Angada also from the death of mother and father, from the grief of Sugreeva - why will 
he retains life?"
"Vanaras being rejected by the sorrow due to their lord will strike their heads with palms and 
fists."
"Vanaras loved by the famous king Sugreeva through good words, through small gifts, through respect 
will give up lives."
"Best among Vanaras will not enjoy together sport in the forest, not on the mountains, not again in covered 
places."
"Together with wife and children and together with ministers being tortured by the grief of their lord, 
they will fall from the top of mountains onto flat lands and rugged lands."
"Vanaras will perform death by taking poison or getting hanged or entering fire or fasting or a 
weapon."
"While I am going I think about the destruction of the Ikshvaaku dynasty and destruction of the Vanaras 
and there will be a terrible wail."
"I will not go from here to the Kishkindha city. I am not capable of seeing Sugreeva without Seetha."
"I while not going, being here those virtuous ones, those great warriors those two Rama and Lakshmana 
will live by hope. Vanaras also who are agile will live."
"Without seeing Seetha subsisting on whatever falls on hand, whatever comes to the mouth, being self 
restrained I will become a hermit living on trees and herbs in a region near the ocean which has many roots, fruits 
and much water."
"Or I will enter fire which is glowing after making a funeral pile or while sitting performing 
fasting onto death my body will be eaten by crows and by beasts of prey."
"This way of giving up the body has been seen by sages. This is my opinion if I do not see Seetha, 
I will enter a lot of water."
"Not seeing Seetha, my garland of the glory of a long time with a strong foundation, beautiful one together 
with fame has been destroyed."
"I will become a hermit who is self-restrained resorting to trees and herbs, I will not go from 
here not seeing Seetha with black eyes."
"If I go back from here without knowing that Seetha, there will not be Angada together with all 
those Vanaras."
"There are lots of blemishes in dying; one who is alive sees auspicious things. For that reason 
I will keep my life. It is definite for the meeting of people who are alive."
Hanuma carrying in mind sorrow of various kinds again and again did not get then the crossing of 
sorrow.
"Otherwise I will kill Ravana with ten heads, with great prowess. Whatever happened to the stolen 
Seetha, this will be revenge for that."
"Otherwise carrying this Ravana over the surface of the ocean I will take him to Rama like an animal 
to the lord of animals."
Hanuma not seeing that Seetha thus begetting sorrow, thought with a mind cluttered with thoughts 
and sorrow.
"To wherever I see Seetha, the wife of Sri Rama and one with fame, till there I will search the 
city of Lanka again and again."
"Based on the words of Sampati if I bring Sri Rama then Sri Rama not seeing wife will burn all Vanaras."
"With limited food and with restrained senses, I live here itself. By my deed those men and vanaras 
- let they not be destroyed."
"Whatever this Ashoka garden with great trees is being seen this I will obtain. This has not been 
searched by me."
"Saluting the eight Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, the two Aswinis, seven Maruts, I will go to increase 
the grief of Rakshasas."
"Defeating all rakshasas, I will give Seetha, who gives happiness to the Ikshvaaku dynasty to Sri Rama 
as the fruit of austerity to an ascetic."
The gloried son of Vayu Hanuma got up with his senses tied by grief.
"Let there be salutations to Sri Rama together with Lakshmana, also to that, who is divine let 
there be salutations. To Rudra, Indra, Yama, and Vaayu let there be salutations."
That Hanuma saluting to all those and also to Sugreeva, observing all directions went towards Ashoka 
garden.
The son of Vayu, that Vanara went by mind before itself toward that Ashoka garden. The auspicious 
one pondered the task to be done later.
"The Ashoka garden definitely will be with many rakshasas, filled with trees, adorned with various 
cultures and sacred."
"There definitely guards will be protecting assigned, trees, omnipresent Lord Vayu also will be 
blowing by without force, and by me, this body has been made small for the sake of Sri Rama and to avoid Ravana."
"Devas together with ascetics will make success to me here, self-born Brahma the divine one and 
devas and Agni and Vaayu, Devendra wearing the weapon of Vajra and Varuna with Pasha in hand and also the Sun 
and the moon and the swings. The great ones Maruts and Eshwara may give me success. Whoever is the lord of all 
living creatures among all living beings others who being unseen exist in the path may give success to me."
"When will I see that noble face with a high nose, with white teeth without any injuries with a 
bright smile, with eyes resembling lotus petals with sight equaling the splendor of a clear full moon?"
"How that powerless Seetha, a helpless one, forcefully taken away by the mean vile Ravana with 
a cruel action, with a decorated form will fall in the range of my sight today.After killing the Kinkaras, Hanuma thought to himself (as follows): "The grove was 
damaged by me. The lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary (sacred to the guardian deity of the demons) 
has not been destroyed. For that reason, I will cause this mansion to crumble down in the same way." 
Thus thinking himself, Hanuma the best among monkeys, son of the wind-god having large jaws, by showing 
his strength bounced up and ascended the lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary, which was as high 
as a mountain-top of Meru.
That Hanuma, an army chief of monkeys, possessing a very great splendor, ascending the 
lofty palatial mansion similar to a mountain shone like a second rising sun.
Overpowering the lofty and inviolable of the sanctuary, Hanuma blazing mansion his splendor, 
meta proposed into a towering-sized body equal to that of Pariyatra mountain.
Enhancing his body to a very big size by dint of his distinction, Hanuma clapped on his 
arms strongly, filling the City of Lanka with sound.
By the great deafening noise, made by clapping on his arms, the birds and also the guards 
protecting the sanctuary unconsciously fell.
"Long live Rama, skilled in archery and the powerful Lakshmana! Long lie the King Sugreeva, 
protected by Rama! I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of the wind god. I 
am the servant of Rama, the king of Kosala kingdom, who is unwearied in action. Even a thousand of Ravanas 
will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking with thousands of rocks and trees in 
battle. Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after offering 
salutation to Seetha, I will go back duly completing my task."
Thus uttering to those guards protecting the sanctuary, roared terribly, making a noise 
and creating terror for the demons.
Hearing that loud noise, hundreds of guards protecting the sanctuary went, taking many 
kinds of weapons, spears, swords, and axes. Those Kinkaras with huge bodies surrounded Hanuma, duly discharging 
those weapons.
They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold, and arrows 
shining like the sun. That troop of demons surrounding Hanuma the best among monkeys, shone like a greatly 
extensive whirlpool in the waters of River Ganga.
Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma assumed a terrific form. Hanuma possesses a gigantic body 
and the son of wind-god, uprooting a pillar with a hundred edges and decorated with gold in that edifice, 
then speedily whirled it around.
Fire was also generated there (due to friction with other pillars) The edifice was then 
consumed by fire. Seeing the edifice burning, Hanuma killing those hundred demons, like Indra killing 
demons with his thunderbolt and gloriously staying in the sky, spoke (the following) words:
"Thousands of monkeys like me, possessing gigantic bodies of strength, were sent on the 
orders of Sugreeva. We and other monkeys are now roaming the entire earth."
"Some of the monkeys have a strength of ten elephants. Some have the strength 
of a hundred elephants. Some are having a prowess equal to that of a thousand elephants."
"Some are having the strength of a strong stream. Some have strength equal to that of 
wind. Some other army chiefs of monkeys even cannot be measured."
"Surrounded by hundreds, myriads, lakhs, and crores of such monkeys having their teeth 
and nails as their weapons, Sugreeva, who is capable of destroying you all, will come."
"You hold enmity with the high-souled Rama. For this, the City of Lanka will not be there. 
Neither you nor even Ravana will survive."Seetha honoured Hanuma, who was ready to go, with good words. Hanuma, having gone to 
a distance from that place, thought within himself (as follows):
"I have seen this black-eyed Seetha. There is only a little that remains to be done by 
me. Abandoning the three strategies for success viz. sowing dissension, negotiation and bribery, I have 
to implement here the fourth strategy viz. open assault."
"In the case of demons, the strategy of negotiation is not practicable. For those persons 
having abundant wealth, the strategy of bribery is not suitable. For persons who are proud of their 
strength, the strategy of sowing dissension is not amenable. Prowess alone is agreeable for me here."
"Except showing of valour, no strategy in accomplishing this task is adequate in these 
circumstances, for the demons can adopt a weak attitude in ensuring combat if their foremost heroes 
are somehow killed here and now."
"He alone can accomplish his purpose, who implements many (secondary) tasks even after 
the initial task has been carried through, without impairing the previous achievement."
'There is indeed no single exclusive method to accomplish a purpose however small a task 
may be. On the other hand, whoever knows to do a task in many ways, he alone is capable of achieving 
that task."
'If I go to the abode of Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys, having ascertained the truth as 
to who will predominate in an encounter between the adversary and ourselves here itself, then will the 
command of my master has been carried out by me."
"How can my combat with the demons now will prove to be a happy one? And, how will my 
strength become fruitful? How indeed will that Ravana applaud me in battle?"
"Then meeting Ravana with his troop of ministers, his army and his followers in battle 
as well as knowing his designs and strength, I will go back from here happily."
"This excellent grove of this cruel Ravana, with its various kinds of trees and creepers, 
which is pleasing to the eyes and the mind, is looking like Nandana, Indra's paradise."
"I will destroy this grove like fire scorching a dried-up forest. While this grove gets 
demolished, Ravana will then be angry."
"Thereupon Ravana will order for an army consisting of horses, great chariots and elephants 
and armed with weapons like great tridents and spears made of iron. Then, a great combat will follow."
"Attacking those demons of terrific prowess, I too with my unbearable prowess, will kill 
that army instigated by Ravana and return to the place of Sugreeva happily."
Thereafter, Hanuma of terrific prowess, getting angry, started then to throw away trees 
by a highly violent jerk of his thighs akin to the jerk of the wind.
Then, the valiant Hanuma laid waste to the royal garden attached to the gynaecium resonant 
with cries of birds in heat and endowed with various kinds of trees and creepers.
Hanuma damaged trees in that grove, destroyed the ponds and crushed the tops of pleasure 
hills to powder. Thus, that grove became nasty at sight.
With its trees and creepers dried up, with the howls of various birds, with its ponds 
destroyed, with its copper-coloured sprouts dried up there, that grove did not look bright, as though 
it had been destroyed by a wildfire. Those creepers with their bars of support displaced, fell  
like distressed women.
"With its arbours and picture galleries destroyed, its great serpents and wild animals 
emitting cries of distress, its grottos and other structures demolished, that grove became defaced.
"That woody land of that pleasure garden which afforded shelter to the women-folk of 
Ravana which has clusters of Ashoka creepers became a jumble of creepers of sorrow for the distressed 
women; by the violence of Hanuma."
Creating a great displeasure in the mind of that high-souled Ravana, the Lord of the 
land of Lanka; that Hanuma decided to fight alone against many mighty demons and stayed
On hearing the words of Angada along with those of his ministers, namely Hanuma, Plaksha, and Prabhava et al, 
also on knowing that Lakshmana is angered, sensible Sugreeva stirred from the seat. 
On discriminating the pros and cons Sugreeva spoke this sentence to the strategist-ministers, for he is 
an expert in strategies and a diligent one in carrying out those strategies. 
"I have not in the least spoken any ill of them, nor committed any misdeed in their respect, thus I am thinking 
why should Raghava's brother Lakshmana take offence at me? 
"Unsympathetic rivals of mine, who will always be snoopy for scope, might have ear-filled Raghava's brother about 
the fabricated faults of mine. 
"In this situation, all of you on your part and according to your perspectives have to find out firstly and meticulously 
about the attitude of Lakshmana, along with a steady but diligent determination thereof. 
"There is no fear for me from Lakshmana, not even from Raghava, but an unfounded ire of a friend alone 
is giving rise to disquiet. 
"It is always practicable to befriend any, but in turn, it is impracticable to manage that friendship, even a trifle 
splits off that friendliness for sentiments are transient. 
"On that score, I am flustering because of the noble-souled Rama, and I cannot possibly requite the favour that 
has been done to me." So said Sugreeva to his ministers. 
While Sugreeva is saying that way, the eminent-monkey Hanuma spoke with a dint of his expediency, from among 
the Vanara ministers. 
"In any case, it is not astonishing to say, oh, king of monkey troops, that you with deep regard have not forgotten 
the advantageous help rendered to you, since it is natural for you. 
"On his part, Raghava tossed off his fear distantly and eliminated Vali, whose valour equals that of Indra, only 
to fulfil your cherish. 
"Anywise, by his friendliness with you Raghava must be annoyed, hence he must have expedited his brother 
Lakshmana, whose disposition in effect to is enhance prosperity. 
"You have become ecstatic, oh, the best of the best timekeepers, hence you are unaware of the slippage of time, 
but the sedate and dark-green autumn on its part is underway unfolding dark-green leaves canopying seven-leaved 
banana plants. 
"Clear is the sky with its planets and stars as clouds have vanished on it, even all the ten directions are clear, 
and the rivers and lakes too are equable. 
"Because the time for campaigns has chanced, oh, the ablest monkey, and because you were very slumberous you have 
not got the drift of it, as such Lakshmana must have come here, and it is obvious. 
"Raghava's bitter words are endurable by you as he is primarily an anguished person, further he is the one whose 
His wife is abducted, and he is magnanimous in giving the kingdom to you, besides, he is reproachful through 
another person, namely Lakshmana. 
"Indeed, I do not foresee any other appropriate means for you, as a blunder is committed by you, other than seeking 
Lakshmana's pardon duly adjoining your palms. 
"A king is to be advised beneficially and unhesitatingly by the minister designates, that is why I am speaking 
what I hold fast discarding fear. 
"If Raghava is highly infuriated he is capable of keeping the world under his control along with gods, demons, Gandharva-s 
just hitching up his bow, isn't he? 
"It becomes unseemly to infuriate him who is to be placated time and again, especially when remembering his earlier 
beneficence to you and when you are beholden to him. 
"Prostrate yourself before him along with your son, friends and relatives to pay deference, oh, king, and abide 
by your own accord, you made with him remaining under his auspices, like a wife abiding in the care of her husband. 

"It will be unseemly to fend off the ruling of Rama, or his brother Lakshmana even in your imagination, oh, 
king of monkeys, as your heart is aware of the human tenacity of that Rama, whose resplendence vies with that 
of Indra, and who is associated with selfsame Lakshmana, isn't it." Thus Hanuma spoke to Sugreeva. On observing clear sky on which back-clouds and electric charges have disappeared, on which Saarasa birds are vibrantly bustling and delightful moonshine is coated, and even on observing him whose riches are abundant, who has slowed down in accumulating probity and prosperity from the viewpoint of rectitude, highly engrossed in the course of unvirtuous profligates, whose heart is given to undisturbed privacy, and the one who on achieving his goals and dearest longings has turned away from other pursuits, who regained his choicest wife, and gained highly covetable Lady Tara, thus, who is always indulged in females, merrymaking day in and day out on a par with Indra, which Indra will be sporting with the cohorts of gandharva and apsara females, thereby he who is making much of his fortune on getting rid of other problems, besides, he who reposed the activity of kingdom in his ministers, yet, who does not make eyes at those ministers as he is doubtless of the kingdom which was once disrupted from his control, because, that kingdom is looked after well by the very same ministers, as such he is wallowing in promiscuity, such as he is, seeking the presence of such a Sugreeva, king of monkeys and an explicator, and even on winning his grace, he who is forthright regarding norms of ethics, an exceptional knower of subtleties of transactions and the rubrics of duty and time, that golden-tongued Hanuma, the son of Air-god, spoke sweet words that are reasonable, heart-pleasing, beneficial, pragmatic, profitable, impressive, immaculate, imperative, and impartial, and which words are also inclusive of care and concern of Hanuma, on making a determination with a belief that Sugreeva will pay heed to his words. "Acquired is the kingdom and glory as well, thus enriched is your dynastic prosperity, but foregathering friends is remaining, and it will be apt of you to negotiate it. "Indeed, he who conducts himself punctually and amicably with friends, his kingdom, glory, and courage will flourish. "Matchless kingdom is his who can keep his treasury, army, friends, and his sovereignty - all these four, in equiponderance. "Therefore, as the one with straightforward actions firstly you resort to an unimperilled course of action, lest any peril is imminent, and it will be apt of you to dutifully achieve the purpose of your friend Rama, for which alone Rama along with Lakshmana came to you, thus let your power preponderate. "Adversity thwarts him who comports himself with overenthusiasm only in self-indulgences, and who does not expeditiously strive for the sake of his friend leaving off all other activities of self-indulgence. "One who belatedly functions for the present mission of his friend will indeed be unassociated with that mission, despite of the fact that he has once performed great deeds in respect of the same friend. "Hence, the task of our friend is delayed, oh, enemy-destroyer, searching for Vaidehi is Raghava's mission and let it be done. "Though the time is lagging, oh, king, that insightful and punctual Rama is not indicating about it to you, though he is hurrying to complete his mission within a time-frame, because he is following you alone abiding under the control abiding by your promise. "Raghava is the cause for augmentation of multitudes, a long-lasting covenantor, and even an undefinable one in his proficiency, and an unparalleled one by his grace. "Certainly you have to carry through his mission as he has carried out your mission previously, and oh, lord of monkeys, it will be apt of you to summon worthy monkeys for searching Seetha. "As long as Rama is not going to prod us for action deem that there is no time lapse, but the minute he does deem it as lapsed. "You are a helpful one even to those that are unhelpful to you, oh, king of monkeys, then why repeat about him who helped you in getting your kingdom, and even in killing your enemy, Vali? "Even if Rama did not help you in getting your kingdom and killing Vali you have to render your help to Rama, for you are a beacon of friendship and you are a helpful one without seeking any requital... then why you are delaying... "Highly adventurous and powerful vanara as you are, oh, lord of multitudes of monkeys and bears, why do you temporize in issuing orders to fulfill the cherish of Rama? "If need be Rama of Dasharatha is capable of keeping gods, demons, and great-vipers under his control with his arrows, but he is anticipating the fulfilment of your promise. "He fulfilled an exceptional cherish of yours without much doubting for the forfeiture of his own life, hence we search for his wife Vaidehi anywhere on earth or even on skies. "Gods cannot cause dismay to him, then Gandharva-s - no; multitudes of wind-gods - no; asura-s - no; yaksha-s - no; and then wherefore the rakshasa-s can? "Therefore, oh, lord of monkeys, that Rama is energetic to exert himself, but he fulfilled your aspiration earlier, and it will be apt of you requite him with his aspiration at all events. "In case you were ordering us, oh, king of monkeys, among us whosoever he may be his impetus will be unhampered either in netherworlds, or in water, or up above on the sky. "Therefore command us, oh, merited one, as you have more than ten million unchallengeable monkeys under your command, as to who should start from where and for which purpose, and as to how one should exert himself." Thus Hanuma appealed to Sugreeva. On hearing the words of Hanuma that are validly demonstrated on time, Sugreeva whose soldiery is substantial, took a noble decision. The noble-minded Sugreeva directed Nila, one of the commanders of the vanara army, who always strives to foregather vanara army, to foregather all of the monkey forces available in all directions. "You have to have organized that way as to how my army in its entirety and from all over, together with corps commanders, is to be marshaled to stay in the cutting edge of the army. "Those that are the quickstepped, venturesome fly-jumpers who are the defenders on the perimeter of the army, they shall be fetched quickly and speedily at my order, and oh, Niila, you on your own have to personally and closely monitor the military establishment without any heterogeneity. "And, the monkey who arrives here after fifteen nights, to him termination of life is the punishment, there is no business for further adjudication. "Associated with Angada you shall approach elderly monkeys like Jambavanta and others, according to my decision and authorized by my order." Thus, Sugreeva, the king of best monkeys assigned the set-up and ordered Niila, the Commander of Vanara Forces, that glorious Sugreeva re-entered his palace chambers.That Hanuma interested in the sight of Seetha, in the middle of that building, went toward houses 
made of plant creepers, art houses, and nocturnal houses but did not see Her with a beautiful appearance.
That great Hanuma then later not seeing that Seetha dear to Rama thought thus: "To me searching 
Seetha in whatever way appearance not being obtained, from that Seetha has died."
"That Seetha standing in the best traditional path being chaste interested, in preserving her character 
must have been killed by the king of these Rakshasas who performed evil deeds - this is certain."
"That daughter of King Janaka died of fear seeing the wives of Ravana with crooked appearances 
- horrible ones without radiance with great faces with long and crooked eyes."
"Without seeing Seetha, not obtaining destiny, and wandering for a long time together with Vanaras, 
to me there is not a path to go near Sugreeva. Sugreeva has a sharp punishment and also is strong."
"All inner city has been seen. Women of Ravana have been seen. The chaste Seetha has not been seen. 
My effort became wasteful."
"To me who has gone back all Vanaras after meeting what they would say? O strong one! Going there, 
what has been done by you? Tell that to us."
"Without seeing that Seetha what can I say? Due to the passing of time, they will obtain 
fire."
"To me who had gone for the other shore of the ocean what will the old Jambavan say? What would 
that Angada and vanaras who meet say?"
"Non-depression is the root of development. Absence of despondency is the greatest comfort. Self-reliance 
always is indeed the promoter in all matters."
"Whatever action a human does that action of man is made to be successful by non-depression. For 
that reason, I will perform a best effort together with non-depression. I will search all those regions ruled by 
Ravana not yet seen."
"Bars have been searched; in the same way flower houses and art houses have been searched; again pleasure 
houses, pathways in the middle of gardens, buildings in all directions have been searched."
Thus thinking Hanuma began to search again undergrounds, houses at the beginning of street intersections 
and also small houses far away from the main houses.
The great Hanuma flew again and again jumping down, standing up, walking, opening doors, 
pushing doors and entering inside, coming out, climbing down, climbing up wandering all opportunities.
That Hanuma in that city of Ravana - whatever region he did not go that region was not there even 
for four adults.
Streets between fort walls, platforms together with the intersection of four streets, wells, lakes 
all these had been seen by him.
Rakshasa women of various forms, with crooked forms and horrific forms had been seen there by Hanuma 
but not that Seetha.
The best Vidhyadhara women incomparable by beauty in the world had been seen there by Hanuma, but 
not Seetha.
Naaga women with beautiful buttocks, with faces equaling full moon had been seen by Hanuma there, 
but not Seetha with a beautiful waist.
Naaga women who had been stolen forcefully, being defeated by Ravana had been seen there by Hanuma, 
not that Seetha
That Hanuma with great arms, the wise one, the son of Vayu not seeing that Seetha and seeing other 
women became depressed again and again.
Seeing the effort of the best Vanaras and the crossing of ocean as being wasted, Hanuma got depression 
again.
Thereafter the son of Vayu Hanuma got down from Pushpaka, obtained thought with a mind overcome 
with grief."After that, Hanuma, the destroyer of foes, desired to travel to the sky where
celestials like chaaranas tread, to search for Seetha, who was taken away by Ravana.
Hanuma who desired to perform a deed done by no one else, shone like a bull without
any obstacles, with his stretched neck and raised head.
After that, the mighty and courageous Hanuma roamed at ease on the lawns with the
hue of an emerald, which looked like still water from a distance.
The thoughtful Hanuma tread like a rampant lion, making birds fear, uprooting trees
by his breast and also killing many animals.
That great monkey Hanuma shone like an elephant in a lake, standing on the foot of
that great mountain by the name of Mahendra, where many elephants of good breed resided, which was
beautifully decorated with many naturally formed mineral rocks of varied hues like black, white,
red, blue, yellow, and green and which was surrounded by godly serpents and Yakshas, Kinnaras,
Gandharvas were capable of assuming the desired form, together with their families.
He saluted with joined palms to the Sun God, Lord Indra, God of Wind, Lord Brahma
and Bhutas and decided to leave.
Hanuma turned towards the east, saluted his father, the Lord of Wind, and increased his
body to go towards the southern direction.
With all the Vaanaras seeing, Hanuma decided to fly, and like an ocean swelling on
full moon days, grew for Rama's success.
With a desire to cross the ocean, Hanuma grew his body immeasurably and pressed the
mountain with his feet and hands.
Thus tormented by Hanuma, that mountain shook for an instant and showered all
flowers of trees on it.
Covered all through by those fragrant flowers which fell from the trees, that
mountain shone like a mountain made of flowers.
That mountain shed water like an elephant in a rut emitting rut juice, after being
pressed by the mighty Hanuma.
Pressed by that mighty Hanuma, streaks of gold silver, and antimony color appeared on
the Mahendra mountain.
Huge Rocks of Sulfur were also shot forth from that mountain, just as a fire burning
with a medium flame would emit columns of smoke.
Being pressed on all sides by the mountain which itself was being pressed by Hanuma,
creatures living in the caves of that mountain shrieked in horrifying tones.
That loud noise from creatures that emanated because of stress caused by the
mountain filled the earth and all four directions and forests near that mountain.
Great snakes with clear swastika signs on their hoods, spewed out frightening flames
with their great heads and bit the rocks with their teeth.
Then those great rocks bit by those snakes with anger and venom burned due to the
flame and split into a thousand pieces.
Medicinal herbs from that mountain, although capable of destroying ordinary poisons,
could not neutralize the poison from those snakes.
Ascetics residing on that mountain flew away from there thinking that some demons
were destroying it. Vidhyadharas who lived there became afraid and flew away with their women
folk, leaving behind them golden jugs of wine in the liquor house, gold vases, a variety of
sauces that can be licked, eatables, various meats, skins of oxen and swords with golden hilts.
The intoxicated Vidyadharas with garlands around their neck decked with red flower
garlands and smeared with sandal paste, with reddened eyes, and lotus-shaped eyes, obtained
the sky.
Vidyadhara women wearing necklaces, anklets, armlets, and bangles stood in the sky
with surprise and smiles along with their loved ones.
Vidyadharas and great sages stood in the sky in a group, showing their great prowess
and viewed the mountain.
Then they heard words of Charanas, Siddhas and pure-hearted Rishis who were located
in that clear sky.
"This Hanuma, who is equal to a mountain, who is the son of Vayu, and who has great
speed, wants to cross the ocean which is abode to crocodiles."
"Hanuma has decided to perform an impossible task for the sake of Rama and Vanaras
and wants to obtain the other side of the ocean which is hard to obtain."
Vidyadharas thus listened to the words of those great people and looked at the
incomparable Hanuma, best among Vanaras, standing on the mountain.
He, who is equal to a mountain, shook his hair, quivered his body, and let out a
great roar like from a vast cloud.
About to fly, Hanuma jolted his tail, which was rolled into a circle from top to
bottom, and was covered with hair, just as Garuda, the king of birds would jolt a snake.
Receiving his vigor, the tail curled at his back was seen like a great serpent being
stolen by Garuda.
Hanuma firmly supported his arms (on the mountain surface) which resembled huge iron
clubs crouched the waist and contracted his feet.
Bending shoulders and neck, that mighty and glorious Hanuma, increased his energy,
strength and courage.
With his eyes raised, seeing the way from a distance, viewing the sky, he held
his breath in his heart.
That mighty Hanuma, equal to an elephant among monkeys and the best among Vaanaraas,
stood firmly with his legs, bent his ears, and before flying spoke these words to the Vaanaraas.
"I will go to the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana just like an arrow released by Rama
will go, with wind-like speed. If I do not see the daughter of Janaka there, I will go with the
same speed to the abode of gods. If I do not see Seetha there in heaven, I will get Ravana the king
of rakshasas tied up in chains without any effort. I will, in all events, return successfully
along with Seetha or I will get Lanka along with Ravana after uprooting it."
The best among Vaanaraas, Hanuma, spoke in this way to Vaanaraas and then without
thinking about anything else, flew up with a lot of vigor. That great monkey also thought himself
equal to Garuda, the king of birds.
While he was flying up, due to that force, all the trees on that mountain flew away in
all directions, drawing together all their branches.
While flying in the sky, he took along with him, because of the force of his thighs,
trees shining with flowers and with fattened lapwing birds.
The trees thus being held aloft by the speed of Hanuma's thighs, followed him for a
while just as relatives would follow their loved ones embarking on a long journey.
Uprooted by the force of Hanuma's thighs, Sal and other excellent trees followed
Hanuma is like soldiers following their king.
Hanuma the great monkey presented a wonderful sight, with his mountain-like
appearance together with the well-flowered trees.
After that, powerful trees sank into the salt ocean like mountains sinking into
ocean due to fear of Mahendra.
That Hanuma who was equal to a cloud, covered with flowers of various kinds, shoots
and buds shone like a mountain with fireflies.
Those trees which were released by Hanuma's speed, dropped flowers and fell into
the water-like friends going back after bidding farewell to their dear ones.
Set in motion by the wind from the movement of Hanuma, that variety of blossom, with
various hues, from the trees fell into the sea. That great ocean shone like the sky filled
with stars.
Hanuma shone like a cloud in the sky decorated by lightening, with flowers of
various hues sticking to his body.
That sea water looked like the sky with delightful stars rising, with flowers
flown up by Hanuma's speed.
That sky-borne Hanuma's arms which were spread out, were seen like five-headed
serpents coming out of a mountain's peak.
That great monkey shone like one who was drinking the great sea together with its
waves. He also seemed like one who desired to drink the whole of the sky.
The eyes of that Hanuma, who was following the path of sky, had a brilliance
equal to that of lightning, were shining like two fires on a mountain.
The round, wide, reddish brown eyes of Hanuma, the best among the monkeys shone like
fully risen sun and moon.
The ruddy face of Hanuma, with His reddish face shone like the Sun touched by
twilight.
The tail of Hanuma, the son of Vayu floating in the sky, being risen looked like
the pillar erected in honor of Indra.
The great intellectual Hanuma, with his great body, and with white teeth, shone like
the Sun, being surrounded by his circular tail.
That great monkey Hanuma, with his red-colored buttocks, shone like a mountain with
a large deposit of red Gairika herb broken into pieces.
Air passing through the lion among monkeys Hanuma's armpits sounded like a
thundering cloud.
The best among monkeys Hanuma flying thus in the sky, looked like a meteor darting
away with great speed in the sky from the northern direction.
With a fast pace equaling that of the Sun god, the tall Hanuma shone like an elephant
which increases its size when being festered by a rope.
Then Hanuma who was flying above the ocean with his body above the ocean and his
shadow being immersed in the sea below, looked like a boat being driven by wind.
Whatever place Hanuma went towards on the ocean, that place became agitated due to
the force of his thighs.
That great monkey great speed flew in the sky striking with his chest a series of
waves which had a great body like that of mountains.
Wind from the mighty Hanuma and the wind released from the clouds caused the ocean
with a fearful sound to shake a lot.
Hanuma flew in the sky dragging along with him big waves from the ocean as though he
were sprinkling them in the sky.
Hanuma with great speed crossed waves that were equal to Mount Meru and Mount
Mandara, that had risen in the sea, as if counting them.
Then the water together with clouds which was driven up by the force of Hanuma,
shone like a stretched autumnal cloud in the sky.
Then various whales, fishes, turtles, and crocodiles were seen clearly in the
sea just as the bodies of humans would be seen when clothes are removed.
Serpents living in the sea saw Hanuma flying in the sky and thought that it was
Garuda, the king of birds.
Hanuma's shadow which was ten yojanas wide and thirty yojanas long appeared very
beautiful on the water.
That shadow which was following Hanuma and spread on the ocean, shone like a series
of dense white clouds.
That great monkey Hanuma, the great resplendent one with a huge body, shone like a
mountain with wings flying in the sky without any support underneath.
In whatever path Hanuma the mighty one went, in that path, there immediately
appeared a trough in the ocean below.
Hanuma while coursing through the path of birds like the king of birds Garuda,
dragged with him a series of clouds like the god of wind.
Great clouds with white, red, blue, and madder colors shone on being dragged by
Hanuma.
Hanuma repeatedly enters and leaves a series of clouds as He flies in the
sky, is being seen like the moon which shines and is hidden alternately.
Then, on seeing Hanuma flying quickly in the sky, Devas, Gandharvas, and Danavas
showered flowers on him.
Then, the Sun did not scorch Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, who was flying for
Rama's welfare. The wind god Vayu also served him with a delightful breeze.
Sages praised the great resplendent Hanuma flying in the sky. Devas and Gandharvas
also sang in His praise.
Immediately on seeing the best among monkeys, Hanuma, flying without any effort,
Nagas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Devas, and birds all praised Him.
While that best among vanaras, Hanuma, was flying, the god of ocean thought thus for
the respect of the Ikshvaaku dynasty:
"If I do not help this best among vanaras Hanuma, I shall become prone to all kinds
of ill-talk by those who want to speak against me."
"I was developed by Sagara of the Ikshvaaku dynasty. This Hanuma who is helping a
descendant of that dynasty should not become tired."
"I have to behave in such a way that Hanuma would take rest. After resting in me for
a while, He can cross the remaining distance with comfort."
Samudra thus making a good thought, spoke to Mainaka, the best among mountains with
gold in the middle hidden in water.
"O best among mountains Mainaka! You have been positioned here by Devendra as an
obstacle to the groups of asuras living in Patiala."
"You are standing at the entrance of Patiala which is difficult to measure, fully
covering it, when asuras courageous by birth are trying to rise again."
"O mountain, you can grow wide, up or down. O best among mountains,
for that reason I am encouraging you. Raise."
"Hanuma, the best among monkeys, the courageous one, who has taken up a fearful task
for the benefit of Rama, that such Hanuma while flying in the sky is coming over you."
"To this Hanuma, who is a follower of the Ikshvaaku dynasty, help should be done by
me now. Descendants of Ikshvaaku are respectable to me. They are even more respectable to you."
"Do help to us. Our task may not be miscarried. A task which needs to be performed
and not done will increase the anger of good people."
"Raise above from the water. This Hanuma is the best among fliers and is a guest
to be worshipped for us. Let him stand on you."
"O mountain with golden-hued middle area and one who is served by Devas and
Gandharvas! Hanuma can take rest on you and then traverse the rest of the distance."
"You are fit to raise after seeing the gentleness of Sri Rama, and the exile of
Seetha, and the effort of Hanuma."
The mountain with gold in the middle, Mainaka, listening to the words of the salty
ocean, got up quickly from the water, together with great trees and creepers.
Then Mainaka became in the risen state, passing through the ocean water, just
like the Sun piercing through a cloud with His shining rays.
That great Manaka was covered by water in all directions, which had peaks with
Kinnaras and great serpents, which were equal to a sunrise, which were touching the sky, and which
had a golden hue, being ordered by the ocean, showed their peaks in an instant.
The sky which had a bluish tinge like that of a sword, shone with a golden hue
because of the peaks of the mountain which rose and which was like molten gold.
That best among mountains became equal to a hundred suns with its peaks which had a
golden hue and which were shining with a self-generated shine.
Hanuma on seeing the mountain that stood before Him, rising from the middle of
the salty ocean suddenly, decided that it was an obstacle.
That great monkey Hanuma with great speed, brought that great tall mountain with
His chest was just as the God of wind would a cloud.
That best among mountains Mainaka, thus being fell by that Hanuma, recognized
Hanuma's speed and lauded him with pleasure.
Mount Mainaka with love and with a gladdened heart obtained a human form and standing
on its peak, spoke these words approaching that courageous Hanuma in the sky.
"O the great Vanara! You have performed this impossible task of flying over the
ocean. Do come down onto my peaks and rest for a while to your comfort."
"The ocean was developed by people born in Sri Rama's dynasty. That such ocean is
worshipping instead of Sri Rama, you who is desirous of Sri Rama's welfare."
"When a service is done, a return service needs to be rendered. This is an ancient
tradition. Such this ocean who wants to do a return service to the Raghu dynasty is suitable for
respect by you."
"After flying a hundred yojanas, let this Hanuma rest on your peak and then travel
the rest of the distance." - Thus I have been encouraged by this ocean for your sake due to His great
respect for you. O best among vanaras! Stop for a while and then go after resting on me."
"O best among vanaras! For that reason, there are lots of roots, fruits, and other
eatables that are fragrant and sweet. May you leave after eating that and resting here for a
while."
"O chief among vanaras! Besides this, there also exists a relationship which is
famous in all the three worlds, which is based on great virtues, for us with you."
"O son of Vayu, the god of wind! O best among vanaras! I am thinking you as being
very important among those vanaras who are fast and who are capable of flying."
"By a person who wants to know dharma or by one who knows dharma, a guest even
though ordinary is to be respected. What else can I say in the case of a great guest like you."
"O best among vanaras! You are the son of the great Vayu - the God of wind, who is
best in speed among the Devas. In speed, you are equal to him alone."
"O knower of Dharma! If you are worshipped, Vayu also gets worship. For that reason,
you are to be worshipped by me. Also, listen to another reason in this matter."
"O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of
Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions."
"After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures
together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall."
"Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the
wings of thousands of mountains with his weapon vajra then and there."
"That Devendra angrily reached me with a raised vajra. Then I was thrown away
immediately by the great Vayu."
"O best among vanaras! With saved full wings, being thrown down into this salt
Ocean, I have been protected by your father."
"O chief among vanaras! Vayu is thus indeed respectable to me. For that reason I respect you. My this relationship with you has great virtues."
"O great Vanara! Because this matter is like this, you are suitable to make myself
and Sagara happy, with a gladdened heart."
"O best among Vanaras! Reduce your fatigue. Accept our worship also. Respect our
love. I am happy by your manifestation."
Hanuma listening to the best mountain's words, spoke thus: "I am happy. Hospitality
has been done. Let this ill feeling be removed."
"The time to perform my duty is hastening me. The day too is passing. A promise has
also been made to me. I should not stand here in the middle neglecting my duty."
The courageous Hanuma saying thus, touched the mountain with His hand, entered the
sky, and flew on with a smile.
That Hanuma was thus seen with great respect by the ocean and the mountain, and also
worshipped with suitable blessings.
After that leaving the mountain and the great ocean and flying up far into the
clear sky, Hanuma followed the path of his father.
The son of Vayu obtained the speed to fly still higher into the sky and seeing that
mountain below went into the clear sky which had no support.
Seeing Hanuma perform that very difficult second task (the first one being the flight
over the ocean), all Devas, Siddhas, and great sages praised Him.
Devas and the thousand-eyed Devendra who were there became happy with the task of
that golden hued Mainaka.
The wise Devendra himself spoke these words through faltering tones due to extreme
happiness, to Mainaka, the best among mountains.
"O Mainaka, the king of mountains! I am very happy with you. O gentle one! I am
giving protection to you. Proceed according to your comfort."
To the dauntless Hanuma crossing a hundred yojanas, who is fearless even when there is
reason to be afraid, a great help has been given by you.
This Vanara Hanuma is going for the benefit of Sri Rama, the son of Dasaratha. I am
very happy with you who is giving respect to Him.
Thereafter, the best among mountains obtained great happiness on seeing Devendra,
the lord of Devas being happy.
Then that mountain with a given boon from Devendra stood still there. Hanuma also
leaped over that part of the ocean in an instant.
Thereafter, Devas together with Gandharvas, Siddhas, and great sages spoke thus to
Surasa, the mother of Nagas, is equal to the Sun in brilliance.
"This glorious son of Vayu, going by the name of Hanuma is flying over the ocean.
You obtain a horrible mountain-like demonic appearance and make a face with fearful tusks,
red-brown eyes, and as vast as the sky, and create an obstacle to Him for an instant."
"We are desiring to find out if by His strength and also courage and intelligence He
can win over you or obtain sorrow."
That Goddess Surasa, thus spoken to by Devas and also being respected by them,
wearing a horribly disfigured appearance of a demon in the middle of the ocean which caused fear to
all, and stopping Hanuma who was flying, spoke these words.
"O best among Vanaras! You have been given by Devas as my food. I will eat you.
Enter inside my mouth."
Thus spoken to by Surasa, the glorious Hanuma, with a happy face and with folded
hands spoke these words to Surasa.
"The son of Dasaratha, with the name of Rama entered the forest of Dandaka together
with His brother Lakshmana and wife Seetha."
"When that Sri Rama, with a bitter enmity towards Rakshasas, was diverted in another
task, His famed wife Seetha had been taken away by Ravana."
"I am going for Rama's sake as a messenger to find Her presence. O subject of Sri
Rama! You are suited to help Rama."
"Otherwise after seeing Seetha and informing that Sri Rama who makes Seetha
without troubles, I will obtain your mouth. I am promising truthfully to you."
Thus being spoken to by Hanuma, Surasa with the power to take the desired form, spoke thus:
"No one can overcome me. This is my boon."
Mother of Nagas, Surasa, desiring to know the strength of Hanuma, spoke these words
on seeing Him going away.
"O best among Vanaras! You are bound to go only after entering my mouth. This boon
had been given to me long ago by Brahma." - speaking thus, with quickness she opened her wide mouth
and stood before Hanuma.
Seeing Hanuma, who looked like a cloud, being ten yojanas long, Surasa also made her
mouth twenty yojanas long.
Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty yojanas long. Surasa made her mouth
forty yojanas high. The courageous Hanuma then became fifty yojanas high.
Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty yojanas long. Surasa made her mouth
forty yojanas high. The courageous Hanuma then became fifty yojanas high.
Surasa then made her mouth sixty yojanas long. The mighty Hanuma in the same
fashion became seventy yojanas high.
Surasa made her mouth eighty yojanas high. The mountain-like Hanuma then became
ninety yojanas high.
The great wise Hanuma saw that mouth with a long tongue which was horrible and
equal to hell being opened by Surasa, greatly reduced His own body, and became the size of a
thumb.
The glorious Hanuma with great speed, quickly entered Surasa's mouth and came out of
it and standing in the sky spoke these words to Surasa.
"O daughter of Daksha! I indeed entered your mouth. My regards to you. I will now go
where Seetha is. Your boon also came true."
Seeing Vanara being released from her mouth like the moon from the mouth of
Rahu, goddess Surasa spoke these words assuming her normal form.
"O gentle Hanuma! Go according to your comfort to achieve the desired task. Bring
Seetha together with the great Sri Rama."
Seeing that third very difficult task of Hanuma, all the creatures then praised
Hanuma said, "Good! Good!".
That Hanuma, equal to Garuda in speed, neared the ocean which is the abode of
Varuna entered the sky and went in His original path.
Hanuma went, like Garuda, in the sky served by clouds (or streams of water), served
also by birds, tread by masters of music Tumbura and other Gandharvas, served by Airavata, borne by
lions, elephants, tigers, birds, and serpents, decorated by clear Vimanas moving with great speed,
shone by fires with thunderous jolt equal to that of Vajra - the weapon of Devendra, decorated by
people with good deeds, people with great luck who conquered the heavens, served by the God of fire
carrying great quantities of oblations, shone by planets, stars, moon, sun, and starlets, occupied
by groups of great sages, Gandharvas, Nagas, Yakshas but unpopulated by humans, clear and all
pervasive, served by the Gandharva king Vishvaavasu, roamed by elephants of Devendra, the path of
the moon and the sun, the auspicious one, a wide canopy of the earth constructed by Brahma, served
in various ways by excellent courageous groups of Vidyadharas.
Hanuma, the son of Vayu, visible everywhere, obtained the sky without support, like
the king of birds with long wings.
A demoness by the name of Simhika with the power to assume the desired form, saw Hanuma
flying, increased in size and thought thus in her mind.
"After a long time, this great animal came into my grasp. After a long time, today I
will enjoy my meal."
Thinking thus in her mind, Simhika attracted His shadow. While the shadow was thus
being grasped, Hanuma thought thus.
"Like a great boat in the ocean with opposing winds, I am being pulled back
forcefully, with disabled power."
After that, Hanuma looking sideways, upwards, and downwards, saw a big animal raised
up in the salty ocean.
Hanuma saw that animal with a horrible face and thought: "This animal with a strange
appearance, with great strength attracting shadow, is indeed the animal that had been told by
Sugriva. There is no doubt in that."
That wise Hanuma recognized that animal correctly as Simhika increased His body
greatly, like a cloud in the rainy season.
Simhika seeing the growing body of the great monkey Hanuma, spread her mouth to
be equal to the middle of Patiala.
Roaring like a dense cloud, she ran towards the Vanara. Then the wise Hanuma saw her
opened a very big mouth equal to His own body and also her internal organs.
That Hanuma with great strength and with a body equal to a diamond, repeatedly
contracted His body and fell into her opened mouth.
Siddhas and Charanas saw Hanuma sinking in her mouth, like the full moon on a full
moon day being swallowed by Rahu.
Then Hanuma rent her internal organs with His sharp nails and after that flew up
with a speed equal to that of thought.
That wise Hanuma fell Simhika down with His vision, courage, and ability,
developed again by speed.
That Simhika with heart rends by Hanuma fell in the water with sorrow. Seeing Simhika
killed by Hanuma, creatures roaming in the sky spoke thus to that best among Vanaras.
"O best among Vanaras! A huge animal has been killed by you. A great task has been
done. Perform the task dear to you auspiciously."
"O best among Vanaras! Whoever has the four qualities of courage, vision, intellect, and skill, all these four virtues like you, such a person will not fail in any task."
That Hanuma the respectable one, thus respected by them, entered the sky and went
like the Garuda with a determined goal.
Hanuma after almost reaching the other shore, looked in all directions and saw a
series of trees at the end of his journey of a hundred yojanas.
The best among Vanaras, Hanuma, immediately after getting down also saw an island
decorated by a variety of trees and also the forests in the region of Malaya.
That Hanuma with controlled senses and with good thoughts looked at the ocean, the
bay and the trees born in the bay, and also the faces of the wives of the ocean (rivers are
considered wives of the ocean), observed Himself to be equal in size to a great cloud as though
stopping the sky, and thought thus.
"After seeing my huge body and the speed, Rakshasas will become curious." - thus
thought the great Hanuma.
For that reason, Hanuma reduced His mountain-like body and obtained the nature of
one who reached self-realization, free from infatuations.
Hanuma greatly reduced His size and became normal regaining His original
form, like Vishnu who mitigated the strength of Bali by taking three strides.
Hanuma is capable of assuming many different beautiful forms, and cannot be defeated by
enemies, obtained the other side of the ocean, and being cognizant of Himself restored His form and
became with a decided mission.
After that great one who looked like a huge mass of clouds, alighted on the mountain
the peak of Lamba with wonderful lower peaks, abundant with various things and filled with Ketaka,
Uddalaka and coconut trees.
After that Hanuma for His part obtained the ocean shore, observed the city of Lanka
from the top of the mountain, leaving His original form, tormenting animals and birds, alighted on
that mountain.
Having tranersed, by the dint of his strength over the ocean which was infested with
demons and reptiles and endowed with a series of huge waves, and alighting on the shore of the great
sea, Hanuma then saw the City of Lanka as having a resemblance to Amaravati, the capital City of
Indra.
The best among vanaras praising Seetha who is fit to be praised, and also praising Sri Rama 
pleasing with His virtues, became immersed in thought again.
That Hanuma the radiant one thinking for a moment, cried about Seetha and became with eyes tormented 
with tears.
"Respectable to Lakshmana, instructed by teachers, Seetha is also dear to teachers; if She is stricken 
with grief, destiny is indeed difficult to withstand."
"Knowing the effort of Sri Rama and sagacious Lakshmana, Seetha is not worried a lot, like Ganga 
in the rainy season."
"Sri Rama is suited to Seetha with Her well-matched character, age and conduct; with well-matched 
pedigree and characteristics this black-eyed Seetha is also suited to Him."
Seeing that Seetha with the radiance of new gold, like the goddess Laksmi, delightful to the world, 
Hanuma went by heart to Sri Rama spoke these words also.
"For the sake of this Seetha, the wide-eyed one, Vali of great strength has been killed, and Kabanda 
also equalling Ravana in strength has been felled."
"In the forest during war Virada of horrible prowess has been killed by Rama by valour, like Sambara 
by Mahendra."
"At Janastaana fourteen thousand of rakshasas of terrible deed have been killed by arrows equalling 
tongues of fires."
"By Rama with a famed mind, Khara has been killed, Trisira also has been fell, Duushana with 
great glory also has been killed in war."
"For Her sake, Sugreeva obtained wealth of Banaras ruled by Vali difficult to be obtained and worshiped 
by the world."
"For the sake of Her, with wide eyes, the ocean, lord of rivers and streams, has been crossed by 
me; this city also has been explored."
"If Sri Rama for Her sake turns upside down the earth with the ocean at the end, and the entire 
universe it is fair, this is my opinion."
"Among three worlds, if it is a choice between kingdom or Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, all the 
kingdom of three worlds will not approach a sixteenth part of Seetha."
"This She is that Seetha, the daughter of king Janaka of Mithila, the great soul, and noble one 
with a firm resolution towards husband."
"While a field was being ploughed She rose splitting the earth covered by auspicious dust of 
field equalling pollen."
"She is the famed eldest daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha the valorous one, not turning back in 
the battle."
"This She the dear wife of Rama the righteous one, grateful one, knower of Self has obtained capture 
of demonesses."
"Whoever Seetha abandoning all comforts, forced by the love towards husband not thinking about 
sorrows, entering a forest unpopulated with humans, being happy with fruits and roots, devoted to the service of 
Her husband, even in the forest is getting great happiness like in a palace, the one with golden limbs, always with 
a smiling talk, not suited to misfortunes - that this Seetha is bearing all this suffering."
"Sri Rama likes to see this Seetha who is endowed with excellent character and tormented by Ravana, 
like a thirsty one for a place where water is available freely."
"By Her gain again Sri Rama definitely will get happiness like a king who lost his kingdom getting 
back the land."
"Left by coveted enjoyments, lacking relatives also Seetha is keeping body desirous of meeting 
with Sri Rama."
"She is not seeing demonesses, not flowers, fruits or trees and with a single heart is meditating 
only on Sri Rama - this is sure."
"Husband is indeed the greatest adornment for a woman greater than jewellery; this Seetha though 
deserving of decoration is not looking charming without Sri Rama."
"Sri Rama although bereft of Her that Lord Rama is doing an impossible task by retaining His body 
and not being depressed by sorrow."
"Knowing Her with black ended hairs, with lotus-like eyes, deserving of comforts, and in sorrow, 
my mind also is gloomy."
"Whoever Seetha with earth-like patience, with eyes resembling lotuses, was protected by Sri Rama 
and Lakshmana, that Seetha now is being guarded by ogresses with crooked eyes at the base of a tree."
"With lost glory like a lotus plant hit by snow, being tormented by a series of calamities, Seetha 
obtained a pitiable condition like a chakravaka bird without a companion."
"Ashoka trees with bent branches due to flowers are giving rise to gloom a lot to Her; Due to melting 
of snow, the risen moon also with thousands of rays is causing grief."
The mighty one, the best among vanaras, quick one, Hanuma thus observed the subject: "This is Seetha!" 
- thus with a firm mind sat at that tree, leaning against it.Then, in the battle-front, Rama and Lakshmana were knocked down senseless. The army
of monkey-leaders fainted. Sugreeva, Nila, Angada and Jambavan could not understand what to do.
Seeing the entire army looking worried, Vibhishana, the best among the intelligent
ones, spoke the following matchless words, consoling the warriors of Sugreeva, the lord of
monkeys:
"Honouring the spell sacred of Brahma the creator, the two sons of the venerable
Dasaratha have actually lost their free will and became dejected and have allowed themselves to be
knocked down by the missiles of Indrajit. Hence do not be afraid. There is no occasion for
despondency now."
"This excellent missile, presided over by Brahma the creator, with never-failing
strength, was given to Indrajit by Brahma. Honouring it, Rama and Lakshmana the princes fell down
in battle. This not a time for despondency here."
Then, the intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god, paying honour to the missile
presided over by Brahma and hearing the words of Vibhishana, spoke the following words:
"Let us restore to confidence whosoever is in this army of energetic monkeys, after
having been struck by the missile."
Both those valiant ones, Hanuma and Vibhishana, together at that time of the night,
roamed about in the battle-front, with torches in their hands.
Hanuma and Vibhishana saw the battle-field, covered on all sides, with
mountain-sized monkeys fallen with heir tails, arms, thighs, feet, fingers and heaps of heads
fractured with blood oozing from their limbs and urine flowing out. The earth was also covered with
flaming weapons fallen around.
Vibhishana and Hanuma saw Sugreeva, Angada, Nila, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Gavaksha,
Sushena, Vegadarshi, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha and a monkey called Dvivida, who were struck down on
the battle-field.
Sixty seven crores of powerful monkeys were struck down by the cherished missile of
Brahma, the self-born creator, in the fifth and last period* of the day.
Hanuma, along with Vibhishana, began to search for Jambavan, while looking at the
terrific army (wounded by the arrows) which appeared like the tide of an ocean.
Looking at Jambavan, the son of Brahma, who was naturally bequeathed with old age,
an elderly person, with his body conspicuous of hundreds of arrows and a valiant person looking
like an extinguishing fire, Vibhishana approached him and spoke as follows:
"O Vibhishana, the leader of demons, with a great prowess! I am able to recognize
you by your voice alone. Pierced with sharp arrows, I am not able to see you with my eyes."
"O Vibhishana, of good manners! Does Hanuma, the foremost among monkeys, because of
whom, Anjana (his mother) and the wind-god are his blessed parents survive, holding his life any
where nearby?"
Hearing the words of Jambavana, Vibhishana spoke the following words, "why do you
enquire about Hanuman, passing over the venerable sons of Dasaratha?"
"O venerable one! The exceptional affection, you are showing towards Hanuma, is not
being shown towards Sugreeva or Angada or even Rama."
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Jambavan replied as follows: "O the foremost among
demons! Listen to me, why I am enquiring about Hanuma."
"If that brave Hanuma is surviving, the whole army even if killed, is unhurt. On the
other hand, if Hanuma has given up is life, we are all dead, even though living."
"O dear child! If Hanuma, who is equal to the wind and the fire in prowess,
survives; then there is a hope for all of us to survive.'
Thereafter, Hanuma the son of wind-god approaching the elderly Jambavan, offered his
salutation, by grasping the feet of Jambavan with modesty.
Hearing the voice of Hanuma, Jambavan, the foremost among monkeys, with perturbed
senses, considered himself as though born again.
Thereafter, that Jambavan of great splendour spoke to Hanuma as follows: "Come on, O
foremost of monkeys! You ought to protect the lives of monkeys."
"You are the great companion for these monkeys, by your copious prowess. There is no
other person. This is the appropriate time to show your prowess. I do not see any other person to
do it."
"Cheer up the martial warriors of both monkeys and bears. Heal Rama and Lakshmana
from their arrow-wounds."
"O Hanuma! You ought to go to Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, by traveling
higher and higher over the large ocean."
"O annihilator of enemies! Thereafter, you will see there the Mount Rishabha, the
excellent mountain and the very much powerful peak of Kailasa, with a golden hue."
"O valiant Hanuma! In the midst of these two peaks, you will see a blazing and
unequally brilliant herbal mountain, containing all kinds of herbs."
"O foremost of monkeys! Sprouted on the head of that mountain, are four blazing
herbs. You can see them, illuminating the ten quarters."
"You can see there, Mrita Sanjivani (capable of restoring the dead to life),
Vishalyakarani (capable of extracting weapons and healing all wounds inflicted by weapons),
Suvarnakarani (restoring the body to its original complexion) and Sandhani, the great herb (capable
of joining severed limbs or fractured bone)."
"O Hanuma! Bring all those herbs quickly. O son of wind-god! Bring succour to the
monkeys, by injecting lives into them."
Hearing the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the son of wind-god was infused with animated
strength, as the ocean gets animated with the force of the wind.
Standing on the summit of Trikuta mountain and pressing the foremost of mountains
(with his feet), that valiant Hanuma appeared like a second mountain.
Then, increasingly pressed and bent by Hanuma's feet, that mountain was not able to
bear its weight and sank.
The trees on that mountain, pressed by Hanuma, fell to the ground and caught fire
due to rapidity of Hanuma. Its peaks also got broken.
The monkeys were unable to stand on that excellent mountain, which started to reel,
while being pressed severely by Hanuma, as the trees standing on it and the rocks got broken.
Confounded with panic, the City of Lanka, whose principal gates were broken, whose
houses and town-gates were shattered, appeared as though dancing at night.
Pressing hard the mountain, Hanuma equal to a mountain, caused the earth along with
the ocean to shake.
From that mountain, Hanuma then ascended Mount Malaya, appearing as Mounts Meru and
Mandara, filled with several kinds of cascades, full of many trees and creepers, having Kamala and
Utpala lotuses blooming, visited by celestials and celestial musicians, having a height of sixty
Yojanas (four hundred eighty miles), frequented by Vidyodharas, a number of sages and Apsaras the
nymphs, filled with various kinds of animal-troupes and illuminated by many caves, Hanuma grew his
body, appearing like a cloud, bewildering Yakshas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras.
Pressing the mountain hard with his feet, opening his terrific mouth which shone
like a submarine fire and frightening the demons, Hanuma roared loudly.
Hearing his loud noise, roaring clamorously, the foremost of demons residing in the
City of Lanka, were not able to stir anywhere.
Hanuma of terrific prowess, annihilator of his enemies, after offering salutation to
the ocean, made up his mind to embark on a prime act for the sake of Rama.
Raising his tail which resembled on serpent, bending his back, contracting his ears
and opening his month which shone like a terrific submarines-fire, Hanuma jumped into the sky, with
a head long speed.
By his velocity, he carried away a multitude of trees, mountains and some ordinary
monkeys. Driven up and away by the momentum generated from his arms and thighs, they fell down in
water when their speed diminished.
Stretching his arms, looking like coils of serpents, that Hanuma vying with the
prowess of hostile Garuda the eagle, headed towards the excellent mountain of Himalayas, with gush
as though he was drawing away the four quarters.
Beholding the sea, whose waves along with its water were made to agitate and all
whose creatures were caused to whirl round, Hanuma quickly speeded up, like the discuss loosed by
the fingers of Lord Vishnu.
Gazing at the hills, flocks of birds, lakes, rivers, pools and excellent towns full
of people, that Hanuma with a speed equal to that of the wind-god his father, shot forth towards
Himalayas.
That valiant Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of his father, whose fatigue was
gone, swiftly rushed, taking recourse to the orbit of the sun.
With a great speed of wind, reverberating the four quarters with sound, Hanuma the
foremost of monkeys, hastened towards Himalayas.
Remembering the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the great monkey with a terrific stride,
suddenly saw Mount Himalaya too.
Hanuma went to Mount Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, embellished with various
kinds of cascades, many kinds of caves, mountain-streams and summits resembling an assemblage of
white clouds as also many kinds of trees.
Having approached that great mountain having excellent overbearing summits, he saw
great holy hermitages, inhabited by a multitude of divine sages.
He saw the abode of Brahma the lord of creation, Kailasa the abode of Shiva the lord
of dissolution, the abode of Indra the lord of celestials, the arrow-discharging place of Rudra,
the worshipping place of Hayagriva, the horse-faced form of Vishnu, the shining place at which
Brahma's head fell down, the sun-god and Kimkaras.
He saw the abode of Agni the fire-god, the abode of Kubera (son of Visrava) shining
like the sun, the spot where the sun was tied down, the abode of Brahma, the abode of bow belonging
to Lord Shiva and the novel of the earth (containing the hole through which one can enter Patala
the nethermost subterranean region).
He saw the gigantic Mount Kailasa, the rock of Mount Himalaya (on which Lord Shiva
is believed to have practiced austerities and abstract meditation) and Mount Rishabha, the lofty
golden mountain, which was highly illumined by the flaming herbs and the lord of mountains on which
all types of herbs grew.
Seeing that mountain shining with a heap of fire, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who is
the envoy of Indra, was surprised to see that great mountain of herbs and then made a search for
the herbs.
That Hanuma, the great monkey, having crossed thousands of yojanas, walked around
that mountain, searching for the heavenly herbs.
Knowing then that somebody was coming in search of them, all the distinguished herbs
on that mountain disappeared from Hanuma's view.
In not seeing them thus, that great souled Hanuma was enraged. He made a loud noise
in anger unable to bear it, Hanuma with his eyes as red as the fire, spoke the following words to
the prince of mountains.
"O prince of mountains! Is it quite sure that you have not shown any compassion for
Rama? If it is so, overcome by the strength of my arms; find yourself shattered to pieces
today."
Fiercely seizing hold of the top of that mountain, furnished with thousands of
minerals, with its trees, elephants and gold, with the projections of mountain shattered and the
crest of its plateau set on fire, at once sprang up with speed.
Having uprooted that mountain, frightening the worlds together with the leaders of
celestials and demons inhabiting them and being praised by many aerial beings, Hanuma sprang up
into the sky and proceeded expeditiously with the terrible speed of Garuda the eagle.
Grasping that mountain-peak, radiant as the sun, that Hanuma who resembled the sun,
having reached the orbit of the sun, shone as a second sun (as sun's image) in the vicinity of the
sun.
In the sky, with that mountain in his hand, that Hanuma the offspring of the
wind-god, who resembled a mountain himself, appeared mostly like Vishnu with his flaming discuss
with its thousand edges holding his hand.
Then, seeing Hanuma, the monkeys made a noise. Seeing them, Hanuma in turn roared in
delight. Hearing their awfully excessive noises the inhabitants of Lanka roared still more
terribly.
Thereupon, the great souled Hanuma descended on that prince of mountains (Trikuta)
in the midst of that army of monkeys. Having offered salutation to the illustrious monkeys there
with his head bent low, he then embraced Vibhishana
By inhaling that fragrance of those great herbs, both Rama and Lakshamana became
healed of their wounds then and there. Other monkey-warriors rose up.
By the fragrance of those most powerful herbs, all those monkey-warriors who were
earlier dead were healed momentarily of their wounds, relieved of their pain, even as those who are
asleep fully get up at the close of night.
From the day the monkeys and demons began to fight in Lanka, from that day onwards,
under the orders of Ravana, all those demons, who were being killed by the foremost of monkeys were
being thrown away into the sea as and when they were killed, merely or the sake of honour (so that
their number may not be known to the monkeys).
Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god, with a great speed, carried away that mountain of
herbs quickly back to the mountains of Himalayas and again joined Rama.Hanuma, the monkey, quickly started along with Angada, Lt. Tara, and others to that
province which Sugreeva has indicated, namely the south. 
Arriving at a remote place with all of those powerful monkeys, then Hanuma searched
the caves and forests of Vindhya Mountains, and on their mountaintops, at impassable places, at
rivers and lakes, and in stands of trees with beamy trees, also on diverse mountains, forests and
trees. 
Though all of those brave vanara-s have searched in all directions they have not
noticed the princess of Mithila and the daughter of Janaka, namely Seetha. 
Feeding upon unalike fruits and tubers, sojourning here and there, those
invulnerable vanara-s conducted their search. 
But that province is an inscrutable one, deeply caved, deeply forested, much less of
water and still less of people, a void and an impenetrable one with a ghastly look. 
They are highly tormented when they vainly search there, and even in another
a province that is also of the same kind, waterless and people-less, and an unreachable one,
abstrusely caved and forested. 
Then all of those monkey commanders gave up that province and entered another
impermeable province as they are fearless from any quarter. 
Whereat the trees are infertile for fruiting, destitute of leaves and flowers, and
whereat the brooks are deprived of water, and whereat it is highly impossible to get even tubers,
there they entered. 
Where there are no buffalos, no elephants, no animals, nor even birds or tigers, or
no other forest-moving beings are there, for they do not have their feed there, they entered such a
province. 
Where there are no useful trees, nor herbal plants, nor climbing plants on trees,
nor creeping plants on earth, and lotus lakes which will be normally pleasing for sight have no
soft leaves, nor bloomed lotuses on their creepers, and even honeybees are discarding them as they
are not richly fragranced, in such a province those vanara-s have entered. 
A highly fortunate, veracious, ascetically wealthy sage known as Kandu is there in
that province, and that great sage is a highly short-tempered, and an impossible one to subjugate
by his self-discipline. 
In that forest that sage lost his son, a ten-year-old boy, as that boy's life ended
thereby which that great sage is infuriated. 
Thereby that virtue-souled sage cursed that great forest in its entirety to become an
uninhabitable and impermeable forest abandoned by birds and animals. 
But those monkeys conscientiously searched such a forest up to its fringes,
including its mountains, caves, fountains, and rivers. 
But not finding the daughter of Janaka or even her kidnapper Ravana there, those
monkeys who are the perfecters of that which is acceptable to Sugreeva have entered another
fearsome forest. 
On entering another fearsome forest which is overly encompassed with climbers and
shrubberies they saw a demon of fiendish deeds who was fearless of gods. 
All of those vanara-s are amazed to see that fiendish demon standing similar to a
mountainous boulder, and apprehending an imminent danger on observing that mountain-similar demon,
those vanara-s have tightly girthed their wrestler's girdle-cloth. 
Even that mighty demon shouting at all vanara-s, 'You are all dead... stay,' rushed
towards them shoving up his clenched fist. 
Angada, the son of Vali, then presumed him who was onrushing as Ravana and saying,
'he is Ravana...' he quickly thwacked that demon indeed with his palm. 
When Vali's son whacked him that demon spewed forth blood from his throat and fell
onto the ground alike an inverted mountain. 
When that demon breathed his last all of those monkeys with triumphal shimmer have
well-nigh searched everywhere, and even in that cave of that mountain where that demon appeared,
presuming that the cave belonged to Ravana. 
Then all those forest-dwelling monkeys searched everywhere else, and like that they
entered another horrible cave which is nearby. 
On searching that cave they came out saddened as their search was futile, and coming
together they sat down at the base of a lonely tree downheartedly as their efforts were unsuccessful
in searching Seetha. On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and he gave away that 
longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god. 
On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu's lineage, placatingly 
addressed his agitated father Dasharatha. 
"Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, 
to move on towards Ayodhya..." So said Rama to his father. 
On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the forehead of Raghava, 
and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is further gladdened in deeming 
that he and his sons took a rebirth. 
Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful city Ayodhya, whose 
royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and bannerettes up above 
them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with urbanites welcomers who 
are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, 
flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced 
at their king's re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. 
When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king Dasharatha followed 
by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the lofty and lordly Himalayan 
palazzo. 
In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and when his long 
cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and other wives are 
overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides. 
Then the womenfolk of the king welcomed the highly propitious Seetha and the highly fortunate Urmila too, along with both 
the daughters of Kushadhvaja, namely Maandavi and Shrutakiirti, with pageantry and festivity. 
All of the brides and bridegrooms clad in silks promptly worshipped the gods in sanctums to the benedictory chanting of 
Vedic hymns and Ritual-fires, thus they shone forth like the tongues of Holy Fires of Vedic Altars. 
Then all the princesses paid respects to all of the respectable ones, and they luxuriated in sequestered palace-chambers 
along with their husbands. 
And those best men among men, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, who are by now accomplished persons in weaponry and 
whose marriages have also come to pass, occupied themselves in the welfare of kingdom while assisting their father and moving 
around with good hearted people. 
Then after sometime that king Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, spoke to his and Kaikeyi's son, Bharata. 
"This is your maternal uncle and the son of king of Kekaya, and this valiant Yudhaajit came here to take you to Kekaya province, 
and he is staying behind because of your marriage..." thus Dasharatha bade farewell to Bharata suggesting that Bharata may 
now go with Yudhaajit. 
On hearing the opinion of Dasharatha, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, then readied himself to travel along with Shatrughna 
to Kekaya province. 
That valiant and best one among men Bharata on asking leave from his father, from Rama, an uncomplicatedly dextrous one 
in undertaking deeds, and even from his mothers, Kaikeyi, Sumitra, and Kausalya, travelled on along with Shatrughna. 
Yudhaajit on clinching not only Bharata, but Shatrughna also, that valiant one is highly gladdened and entered his own city, 
indeed to the high rejoice of his father, King of Kekaya. 
After the departure of Bharata, then the masterly proficient Rama along with Lakshmana started to square with the plans 
and programs of his godly father for an ideal-sovereignty. 
Rama keeping his father's directives in view undertook welfare activities for the people that are agreeable and even advantageous 
to them, and in the entirety of those activities, and he undertook activities to humour motherly affection with his mothers, 
and educational activities with educators, and in a highly self-disciplined manner he used to review them carefully from 
time to time. 
That way Dasharatha is pleased with the deportment and comportment of Rama, likewise the Brahman-s and urbanites, and even 
all of the indwellers in the entire kingdom are pleased, and he who has high distinction, his truthfulness alone is his 
vantage point, and whose hallmarks are of higher degree, that Rama has manifested himself to those subjects in the kingdom, 
and even to all of the living beings in the world, as the Self-Created Brahma. 
Also, that hearty Rama who permeated into the heart of Seetha is ensconced in Seetha's heart alone, and he disported for 
many seasons along with Seetha. 
Seetha has become the beloved of Rama as she is wedded with the assent of his father Dasharatha, further Rama's love for 
Seetha burgeoned by virtue of Seetha's own virtues and loveliness. 
Even Rama as her husband made his mark in Seetha's heart twice as good, and they both used to clearly converse about their 
thoughts in their heart of hearts, just by their hearts. 
In her mien Seetha is identical with goddesses, and she is like personified Goddess Lakshmi, thus she is the reshaped Divine 
Prosperity, and as she hails from Holy Mithila she shall be held Holy, and since she is the daughter of Janaka, a loftiest 
sagacious and invincible king, she is sagely and stately, besides being shapely, and she with all these heaps of natural 
traits and characteristics, Seetha is rejoicing the heart of Rama. 
When passionately conjugated with such a princess from the irreproachable king Janaka, Rama, the son of sagely king Dasharatha, 
has enthusiastically shone forth like the God of Gods and the Efficient Cause, namely Vishnu, when He is together with Goddess 
Lakshmi. Hearing those words spoken by the mighty Kumbhakarna of colossal body and large
arms, Mahodara spoke as follows:
"O Kumbhakarna! Though born in a good race, you are audacious, having the perception
of an ordinary man as also arrogant. You are unable to know the right to be done at all times."
"O Kumbhakarna! It is not that the king does not know about the prudent and the
imprudent conducts. Due to childishness and audacity, you, on your part, are craving merely to
talk."
"The king of demons, knowing about apportioning of place and time, understands the
subject about strengthening and mining (of relationships) as well as his own position and the
position of others."
"What would a wise man attempt to do that which cannot be achieved by a man of
ordinary intellect, though strong, does not sever his elders?"
"You are speaking as though virtue, wealth and pleasure are dwelling separately (in
water-tight compartments). By their very nature, there is no accurate description to know those
things."
"Action alone is indeed the means to get all the consequences. Even sinful acts
spring up into a fruit of prosperity!"
"Acts instrumental to virtue and wealth as well as other acts (instrumental to
injustice and non-value) have just the prosperity as their fruit. But, acts instrumental to
injustice and non-value gain the fruit of offence of omission."
Living beings reap the fruit of good actions in this and in the other world.
However, he who remains diligently devoted to actions with a view to attaining sensuous pleasure
enjoys blessing even in this life."
"In such a situation, this act of pursuit of sensuous pleasure has been cherished in
his heart by the king and was approved by us. What violation is there in doing this daring act
against the enemy?"
"Regarding the reason which you have adduced for marching all alone for the
encounter, I shall tell you what is irrelevant and not so good."
"How will you conquer, single-handed, that Rama by whom several mighty demons were
destroyed in Janasthana earlier."
"Are you not seeing those frightened demons (though highly energetic) who are now
staying in the City, but who were earlier conquered by Rama in Janasthana?"
"Though you know that Rama, the son of Dsasratha, is like an enraged lion, you wish
to awaken a serpent, who is sleeping."
"Who would be competent to approach that Rama, who is forever shining with a
splendour, dangerous to catch-up and as unbearable as death?"
"Standing face-to-face with that enemy is all remaining in doubt. Going there
single-handed does not indeed find favour with me."
"Having lost his advantage, who would feel inclined to reduce to submission, an
enemy, who is rich in advantage and determined to lay down his life, as an ordinary person?"
"O Kumbhakarna, the foremost among the demons! How do you wish to combat with Rama,
with whom none in the human beings is equal and who is equal of Indra and the sun?"
Having thus spoken to the enraged Kumbhakarna, Mahodara on his part spoke as
follows, in the midst of demons, to Ravana, who made the people cry.
"Why are you delaying further, after having captured Seetha already? If you do so
wish, Seetha will be submissive to you."
"Some strategy has been discovered by me, as a means of bringing her round. If it is
found agreeable to your intellect, then listen to it.
"Announce (by a beat of drum in the city-streets) that myself, Dvijihva, Samhraadi,
Kumbhakarna and Vitardana these five demons are setting out for the battle to kill Rama."
"Thereupon, having gone to the battle field deliberately, we shall give him a fight.
If we conquer your enemies, there is no need for any strategies to us."
"Otherwise, if our enemy survives, we, who have engaged in the fight, then shall
implement the plan which was resolved by us in the mind."
"Moistened with blood on having our bodies torn with arrows marked with the name of
Rama engraved on them, we shall come back here from the battle."
Saying "Rama as well as Lakshmana has been devoured by us", we shall clasp your
feet. You fully grant our desire."
"O king! Then, have it proclaimed by beating of trumpets in the entire city, on the
back of an elephant, that Rama has been killed along with his brother and his army."
"O annihilator of enemies! Becoming pleased for the name-sake, arrange to bestow on
your servants, objects of enjoyment, other desired objects and gold."
"Then, present garlands, garments and cosmetics to champions as well as abundant
gifts to other warriors. Drink yourself delighted."
"When this thick rumour has gone to all sides that Rama along with his companions
have been devoured by the demons and you approach Seetha in private and restoring her to confidence
and even conciliating her, tempt her with gold and grain, as well as luxuries and precious
tones."
"By this false pretence, creating fear and anguish, Seetha who thinks she lost her
husband, will submit reluctantly to your will."
"Believing that her charming husband is destroyed, Seetha from her hopelessness and
feminine feeling of flexibility, will come to your will."
"Seetha, who grew up with comfort, who is deserving of happiness; but emaciated with
grief, knowing that her happiness depends on you, will by all means come near to you."
"After contemplating very well, I have conveyed like this. As soon as you see Rama,
a calamity will happen. While you stay here itself without fighting, you will obtain a great
benefit of happiness. Do not become restless."
"O king! An emperor who conquers his enemies without losing his army, without
meeting with danger and without a combat will obtain for long, a great fame, merit, prosperity and
glory."On seeing at that best sage among best meditators Sage Vashishta, the great-mighty and valorous Vishvamitra 
is highly rejoiced and obediently made an obeisance to the sage. 
The great-souled Vashishta spoke, "you are welcome," and that godly sage has indeed shown a high seat 
to Vishvamitra. 
The eminent saint Vashishta then customarily offered fruits and tuber to the courageous Vishvamitra 
who by now has assumed a seat. 
On receiving that deference from Vashishta, then that unsurpassed king Vishvamitra asked after the well-being 
of the ascesis, Fire-rituals and disciples and their progress in that hermitage, and that great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra has also asked after the well being of flora and fauna of the hermitage, and Vashishta reported 
to the matchless king about the all round well-being of every activity. 
Vashishta the supreme one among meditators, a great-ascetic, and the brainchild of Brahma has then asked 
Vishvamitra who is sitting at ease. 
I hope that you are fine! And oh, righteous king, hope that you are ruling people righteously with 
kingly righteousness to their contentment. 
I hope your servants are looked after well, hope all of them are abiding by the rulership, oh, vanquisher 
of adversaries, I hope that you have surely vanquished all of your adversaries. 
"For you are an impeccable one and an emery-inflamer, oh, tigerly-man, I hope that your forces, exchequer 
and confederates are fine, and all is well with your sons and grandsons." Thus Vashishta asked the well-being 
of Vishvamitra. 
The great-resplendent king Vishvamitra respectfully replied Sage Vashishta saying, 'everything 
is fine.' 
Both of those celebrities of conscientious then exchanged pleasantries for a long time with their rejoice 
heightening and gladdening one another. 
Then at the end of discussions, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, that godly Sage Vashishta smilingly 
spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. 
I wish to offer guestship befitting to your status, oh, great-forceful king Vishvamitra, to a matchless 
one like you and to this military force of yours, kindly accept it from me. 
'You may kindly accept all these hospitalities offered by me, oh king, for you are an important guest 
you ought to be reverenced effortfully.' So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. 
When sage Vashishta said in this way, that highly-intellectual king Vishvamitra said to him, 'hospitality 
is deemed to have been offered to me with your reverential words, it is enough and nothing more is necessary.' 

I am entertained with whatever item that obtains in your hermitage, say fruits, tubers and water 
for feet-wash and to wet mouth. Why those petty items, I regaled just by seeing you, a godly sage like. 
Oh, highly noetic sage, by yourself you are a sage worthy to be reverenced by one and all, such as you 
are you alone have reverenced me. Now I wish to take leave, please accept my obeisance to you, and please 
look upon us with a friendlily regard. 
Even if the king was speaking in this way obliquely to him, that virtue-souled and magnanimous sage 
Vashishta entreated the king repeatedly. 
Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra then replied the eminent saint Vashishta, "Agreed! As it pleases the godly 
sage. So be it!" 
When Vishvamitra said that way then Vashishta, the best one among meditators, and one whose blemishes 
are laved is gladdened, and started calling his speckled cow, namely Shabala, yclept Kaamadhenu. 
Come on, oh, Shabala! Come quickly and listen to my words. I prepared to accord hospitality with 
a highly delectable royal banquet to this kingly sage together with all his forces. You arrange it for 
me. 
Oh, Kaamadhenu, the Divine Cow, the Milker of All-Desires, for my sake you shower whatsoever foodstuff 
is savoured by whosoever according to one's own piquancy from each of the six savour, that too plentifully. 

" 'Oh, Shabala, you create heaps of savourily foodstuffs comprised of masticable items like crunchy 
foods, drinkable items like soft-drinks, tasteable items like honey-like viscous dishes, squeezable 
items like pulpy fruits, and be quick.' " So said Sage Vashishta to that Sacred Cow, Kaamadhenu, and 
Vishvamitra continued his narration. After killing that stupendously mighty demon Viradha in forest, then Rama comfortingly embraced Seetha, and spoke to his 
brother Lakshmana who is beaming forth with resplendence. 
"Difficult is this impassable forest, nor we are forest inhabitants either... let's go quickly to that ascetically rich 
sage Sharabhanga..." 
On his approach at the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, a sage with a divine effect and the one with a purified soul, saw 
a great wonder at the nearby of that hermitage of Sharabhanga.
Rama has seen Indra, the lord of three worlds, with a radiant body that has the coupled radiance of Sun and Fire, mounted 
on a great chariot that does not touch the earth, wearing greatly brilliant ornaments and attired in spotless dress, while 
the other divinities are attending, and many more selfsame great-souls are worshipping him. 
Rama saw at his very nearby a chariot yoked with green horses that traverses in firmament, which in its splendour is either 
like the noontime sun, or a cluster of silver clouds, or like the silvern sphere of the moon. 
He saw the stainless parasol of Indra, marvellously garlanded and shining forth, and the exemplary and invaluable royal 
fanning instruments with golden handles, which two best female celestials are handling and fanning at Indra's head sides 
with them. 
And the celestials like gandharva-s, amara-s, siddhaa-s and very many great sages as well are extolling Indra who is abiding 
in firmament. 
On seeing Indra speaking there to sage Sharabhanga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana. 
Rama then on pointing out the chariot expressed his own amazement saying, "Lakshmana see this wonderful chariot that includes 
effulgence and auspiciousness as well, and that abides in firmament, and highly luminous like the Sun... 
"Of which horses we have earlier heard from our teachers telling that they belong to Indra, the Chief Invitee in Vedic rituals, 
they are these divinely green horses that now abide in the firmament, and definitely these must be Indra's horses... 
"And oh, manly-tiger Lakshmana, those that are there in hundreds and hundreds around Indra, those youthful ones with their 
ear-ornaments and swords in hands, with wide and broad chests, with club shaped arms, and clad in glimmering red garments, 
all are like tigers, all are unapproachable, all of them are wearing ornamental chains on their chest-place that are akin 
to flaring fires, and in their appearance, Soumitri, they always bear a look of twenty-five-year-olds... 
"The age factor of gods remains constant at the age that appears for these nice-looking Tigerly-men, so they say... 
for gods are immortals and they will be ever young... 
"Stay for a moment Lakshmana along with Vaidehi, until I know clearly about that resplendent one on that chariot... 
On saying to Lakshmana stay there only...' Rama proceeded towards the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga.. 
Then, on seeing Rama arriving there, Indra, bade farewell to Sage Sharabhanga and said this to the celestials attending 
him. 
"Here comes that Rama...before he talks to me, you lead him towards his vow, after completing the result of his incarnation, 
then only he is eligible to see me... Let him be a victorious and accomplished one, then I will see him very soon...for 
that will happen very soon... A great deed is to be verily performed by him that is highly impossible for others... [--, 

Then that Enemy-destroyer Indra adoringly bade farewell to the sage, and travelled to heavens by the chariot with its green 
horses. 
On the transit of that Thousand-eyed Indra, Raghava with his adherents  came nearby the 
Sage Sharabhanga, who is sitting nearby the altar of fire. 
Touching the feet of that Sage Sharabhanga Rama along with Seetha and Lakshmana, and duly permitted and invited by that 
Sage Sharabhanga they sat there, as they obtained a shelter. 
Then, Raghava enquired with sage about the arrival of Indra and Sage Sharabhanga narrated all that to him. 
"Oh! Rama, that boon-giver Indra wishes to take me to Brahma's abode, which is achieved by me by my arduous ascesis and 
that which is unattainable for them with their souls unconquered... 
"On knowing that you are course is nearby, oh! Manly-tiger, and without seeing my dear guest I do not wish to go to Brahma's 
abode... 
" Having met with you, a virtuous one and a great soul as you are, oh, manly-tiger, I wish to go through undesirable lesser 
heavens to Brahma's abode, the highest 
"Oh! Tigerly-man, non-diminishing are the abodes achieved by me either in Brahma's abode or yonder than paradise...you take 
them all...that are mine achieved by me ascesis..." So said Sage Sharabhanga to Rama. 
Thus said by the Sage Sharabhanga to that Manly-tiger Rama, being the scholar in all the scriptures he spoke this sentence 
to that sage. 
"I alone can gain all those worlds, oh! Great Saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you... 
 
"I will however take all those worlds of yours, for you have waited for me and dedicated whatever you achieved by your penance 
at my tri-feet, asatithi satkaara, honouring guests - ' leaving 'the doer and doing' attachment, 
and without desire to enjoy the fruits of works, as akarma phala tyaagi. For now, show me 
a place to dwell in this forest like an ordinary human being - 
"I will win-over all those worlds myself, as Kshatriya-s are not supposed to take any donations; they either have to won 
by them or acquire them for themselves, just show me a place to dwell - 
"Everything merges in me alone, for I alone gave all these to you, and you also dedicated the same in me, without the concept 
of doer and doing - 
Thus said by Raghava, who is like Indra in strength, that supremely intellectual Sage Sharabhanga again spoke this sentence 
this way. 
"Here, oh! Rama, a great resplendent sage named Suteekshna, lives in this forest...a virtuous and a self-disciplined one, 
and he will do something benignant to you... 
"You approach Sage Suteekshna and to you he will arrange housing in his auspicious and dpleasant place woods of hermits... 

" Following opposite to its flow you may follow this River Mandaakini that carries flower-ferries, then you can reach there 
at Sage Suteekshna's hermitage...] 
"This is the only way, oh, manly-tiger, and oh, sire, see me for a moment, till I forsake these body parts of mine, like 
a snake casting its withered moult... 
Then that hymnist on invoking the sacred fire and offering oblations with clarified butter into it, that radiant sage Sharabhanga 
entered that sacred fire. 
The fire burnt down that great soul Sharabhanga from head-hair to body hair and thus his shrunk skin, bones and whatever 
flesh and blood are there, they are also burnt completely. 
Those who obtained divine knowledge about this mortal body, and those that cannot practiceanuSThaanatheir daily 
chores, or with any incapability, and those that have left house as holder, and desiccated, could give up their mortal bodies 
into fire, waters or falling from mountain peaks.
He that Sage Sharabhanga, then reappeared as an youngster in the semblance of Fire, o\n resurrecting from that altar of 
fire he shone-forth. 
He that Sage Sharabhanga, transcending the ethereal worlds of fire-worshippers, of saints, of great souls, and also of divinities, 
has ascended to Brahma's abode. 
He that meritorious and best Brahman Sharabhanga has seen Brahma in Brahma's abode, and Brahma too, on seeing that Brahman 
happily spoke to him... "Welcome..." Rama arrives at the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna, as directed by Sage Sharabhanga in 
the previous chapter and asks the sage to show a place to dwell. Suteekshna asks Rama to stay at his 
own hermitage, which has no other problems than the wild animals that come in herds and make blaring 
noises. Rama wishes to kill those animals that hamper the tranquillity of hermits living therein, but 
having observed the kindness of Suteekshna towards those wild animals, however disturbing they may be, 
Rama refrains to kill them, and would like to go to any other place than this. They spend that night 
there.
Rama, the enemy-scorcher, has gone towards the threshold of the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna 
along with his brother Lakshmana and Seetha, also along with those Brahmans who accompanied him all 
the way. 
He travelling on a long way, and on crossing rivers with plenty of waters has seen a 
tranquil mountain towering like great Mt. Meru. 
Then those best ones from Ikshvaku dynasty, those two Raghava-s along with Seetha have 
entered the forest which will always be full with diverse trees. 
Entering that perilous forest with its many a flower and fruit bearing trees, they have 
seen the hermitage in a reclusive place adorned with rows of jute cloths as though garlanding it. 
There on seeing the ascetically rich Sage Suteekshna sitting in yogic posture with his 
body bearing lotus-like blotches of soil, Rama dutifully spoke to him. 
"Oh! godly sage I am Rama, I have come to see you, hence oh, knower of virtue, oh, great 
sage, oh, one with truthfulness as your courage, please talk to me..." 
Then that sage having seen that brave and best proponent of virtue, Rama, embraced him 
with both of his hands, and spoke this sentence. 
"Welcome to you Rama, best of Raghu dynasty and the best patron of truth, and when you 
presently caught this hermitage unprepared this has become a well-lorded one... 
"I am awaiting for you only, oh, greatly renowned one, without my ascent to heavens by 
casting off this body on the earth's plane, oh, brave one, for I have heard that you have arrived at 
Chitrakuta after you are repudiated from your kingdom... 
"The king of gods and the chief invitee in hundred sacrifices Indra approached me, and 
that great deity said me that I have conquered all the worlds by my meritorious deeds... 
"Let me bequeath those worlds that are cherished by gods and sages alike, but which are 
won over by me by my ascesis, and you enjoy in them with your wife and with your brother Lakshmana... 

That self-respecting Rama replied the radiant sage with intense asceticism, a great soul 
and an advocate of truth by himself, as Indra would reply to Brahma. 
"I alone can gain all those worlds, oh, great saint, I now seek a place to dwell here 
in this forest as indicated by you... 
"You are an expert in all affairs, and you are interested in the welfare of all the beings, 
so said the great souled Sage Sharabhanga of Sage Gautama's dynasty..."  

When said thus by Rama, that great sage with world renown spoke sweet worded sentence 
with great pleasure. 
"You can take delight in this good featured hermitage alone, for groups of sages will 
always be moving here, and this always contains tubers and fruits..." Thus said Sage Suteekshna. 
"But herds of very large animals will be coming to this hermitage, they return after 
scaring us, of course without killing anyone, and they fear none... 
"Know that no other problem is there other than the animals..." So said the sage. On 
hearing those words of that great sage, that brave elder brother of Lakshmana taking bow and arrow said 
this sentence. 
"I will eradicate them, oh, greatly blessed one, those animals that will come collectively 
in herds with sharp edged, curve-end arrows... 
"But you may be more interested in those animals mercifully, then what will be there 
more painful to you, hence I deem our staying in this hermitage for along will be unbefitting..." So 
said Rama. 
On saying thus to the sage then Rama came by the twilight, and he paused at it. On worshipping 
the westward vesperal time, Rama arranged a stay for himself along with Seetha and Lakshmana, there 
in that delightful hermitage of Sage Suteekshna. 
Then the great soul Sage Suteekshna on completing his evening rituals and on observing 
the fall of night he himself courteously served food that is auspicious and worthy of sages to two of 
the best men, Rama and Lakshmana. Then on the next day morning after getting the ritual liturgies performed through sages, he that articulator Janaka articulated 
this to sage Shataananda, the royal priest. 
My younger brother renowned thus as Kushadhvaja, a highly self-righteous one and a highly brilliant one is ruling from 
the auspicious and holy city named Saankaasya, which city is surrounded by River Ikshumati as a natural moat, in which moat 
bastions of tridents are staked all around... and my brother presides over that city as if he is sitting in the Pushpaka 
aircraft of richly-rich god Kubera, and as though supping the sugarcane juice-like waters of River Ikshumati... 
"And I wish to see him, as he is the nominated benefactor of this Vedic-ritual of mine, and he too shall become a rejoicer 
in partaking the joyousness of this marriage... " So said Janaka to Shataananda. 
That way when Janaka asseverated that enunciation in the presence of Shataananda, Shataananda in turn ordered and summoned 
envoys, and then some alacritous envoys have come, whom Janaka ordered to proceed to his brother. 
By the order of the king those envoys who have speedy horses have travelled on to city Saankaasya speedily, to lead forth 
that tigerly man Kushadhvaja that speedily, which is as good as fetching Vishnu by order of Indra. 
On arriving in city Saankaasya those envoys have seen king Kushadhvaja and on submitting what has happened to the king about 
Rama's breaking of Shiva's bow, and they have also submitted the point of view of Janaka regarding marriages of four daughters. 

On hearing that event from the worthy envoys whose speed is praiseworthy, king Kushadhvaja came right away to Mithila by 
the order of king Janaka. 
Kushadhvaja addressed himself to the insightful one and a compassionate person in the duty of an elder brother, namely Janaka, 
and on reverencing sage Shataananda firstly, next he has reverenced his fondly affectionate brother Janaka, and then he 
sat upon a majestic seat, that which is befitting to kings. 
Both the brothers of unlimited self-refulgence having assumed their high seats, they who are distinguished for their righteous 
acts have started to send Sudaamana, the distinguished minister. 
"Oh, minister plenipotentiary, Sudaamana, you please proceed immediately to king Dasharatha, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s with 
illimitable resplendence, and let that invincible king Dasharatha be led hither along with his sons and along with his Vedic-celebrants..." 
Thus Janaka ordered Sudaamana, the minister. 
Accordingly Sudaamana has gone to the visitatorial-palace of the promoter of Raghu's heritage, namely Dasharatha, and he 
said this on appearing before that king duly bowing down and hailing the king. 
"Oh, valiant king, oh, sovereign of Ayodhya, his highness the sovereign of Mithila from the heritage of Videha kings is 
poised for seeking an audience with your highness, along with your highness' royal-priest Vashishta and other mentors..." 
The minister Sudaamana said so to Dasharatha. 
On hearing that best minister's words, then king Dasharatha came to the place where Janaka is available, along with his 
kinsmen and the assemblages of sages. 
That sententious king Dasharatha said this to the king from the lineage of Videha kings, Janaka, who is with his mentors, 
kinsfolk, and ministers. 
"Oh, exalted king Janaka, you already appreciate that this godly sage Vashishta is godlike to the bloodline of Ikshvaku-s, 
and in all affairs he is our internuncio... 
"Should an assent be given by Sage Vishvamitra, along with all the great sages present here, this equanimous Vashishta will 
narrate about my bloodline, lineally..." And, to the nod of Vishvamitra Dasharatha become reticent, and then the godly and 
sententious sage Vashishta who is along with his men of the cloth said these sentences to the king of Videha, namely Janaka. 

The Unprovable emanated the timeless, changeless and perishless Brahma, and from that Being, namely Brahma, Mariichi is 
begotten, and Kaashyapa is the son of Mariichi, and the Sun is begotten from Kaashyapa, and Manu is said to be the son of 
the Sun... 
Manu is the earliest Prajaapati and Ikshvaaku is the son of Manu, and that Ikshvaaku is the first king of Ayodhya... know 
thus... 
The son of Ikshvaaku is the legendary Kukshi, thus he is renowned, and the famous Vikukshi is the son of Kukshi... 

From that most brilliant and courageous Vikukshi, Baana emerged as son, and the highly refulgent and valinat Anaranya is 
the son of Baana... 
Pruthu is the son of Anaranya, and Trishanku is Pruthu's son, and the highly renowned Dhundumaara happened to be the son 
of Trishanku... 
Dhundumaara begot a highly glorious and a speediest charioteer Yuvanaashva as son, and Mandhaata emerged as the son of 
Yuvanaashva... 
Maandhaata engendered the highly noble Susandhi as son, and even Susandhi engendered two sons, namely Dhruvasandhi and 
Prasenajit... 
From Dhruvasandhi, an illustrious one named as Bharata is begotten, and Bharata begot a highly effulgent son named as Asita... 

To which Asita, kings like Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant Shashabindu-s have become adversaries and kings in 
hostility, he had to wage war with them... 
While counterattacking those kings, Asita is dethroned in war and then he reached Himalayas along with his two wives... 

Asita was with his meagre forces when he was in Himalayas, and there he drew nigh of his Time. At the time of his demise 
two of his wives were pregnant, and one of two wives gave toxic food to the co-wife for abortion... thus we heard... 
There was a saint named Cyavana, the heir of Sage Bhrigu, who in fascination with best and beautiful mountains then taking 
shelter on Himalayas. 
One of the two wives of Asita, the lotus-petal eyed and highly fortunate one queen came there desirous of a best son, and 
reverenced the sage who is godly in his glow... 
Another queen Kaalindi who administer food poison to her co-wife has also come to the sage, and she too reverenced him. 
That sage spoke to her who received poison from her co-wife regarding the birth of her son. 
'Oh, highly fortunate lady, a very good son and a very mighty son is there in your womb. Soon you will give birth to a 
highly vigorous, highly refulgent son and that illustrious one will take birth with toxicity, but there is no need to worry...' 
So said Sage Cyavana to the queen of Asita who received the poison. 
On reverencing Sage Cyavana that husband devout princess whose husband is no more that lady gave birth to a son... 
"Because he took birth along with the poison administered to his mother by her co-wife, he became Sagara, the emperor..." 

From Sagara it is Asamanja and from Asamanja it is Amshuman, and from Amshuman it is Diliipa, and the son of Diliipa is 
Bhageeratha... 
From Bhageeratha it is Kakutstha, from Kakutstha it is Raghu, and Raghu's son is the great resplendent Pravriddha, who 
is reduced to a human flesh eater, and he is also known as Kalmaashapaada... and from him, that Pravriddha, Shankana is born... 

Shankana's son is Sudarshana, and from Sudarshana it is Agnivarsna... And Shiigraga is the son of Agnivarsna, and Shiighraga's 
son is Maru and from Maru it is Prashushruka, and Ambariisha is the son of Prashushruka... 
Ambariisha's son was Nahusha, the emperor and Yayaati is the son of Nahusha, but Naabhaaga is born to Yayaati... 
Aja was Naabhaaga's son and from Aja, this Dasharatha is manifest, and from him, from this Dasharatha, these brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana are born... 
"Oh, best one among men, Janaka, from the beginning this bloodline of Ikshvaaku-s is spotlessly immaculate, immensely impeccable, 
indomitable, and irreproachable, and in respect of these kings born in this line of blood, oh, king Janaka, I espouse that 
it will be meetly of you to offer your seemly daughters to this seemly pair of Rama and Lakshmana..." So said Vashishta 
to king Janaka. When Dasaratha returned, the Lord Indra, the destroyer of Paka the demon, was very
much pleased and spoke to Rama, who stood there with his oined palms.
"O Rama, the foremost among men! Your sight of us, should not go in vain. Therefore,
tell us whatever is desired by you."
Hearing the words of the great souled Indra the lord of celestials, after having
been pleased, Rama with the most placid mind spoke the following words with rejoice:
"O the foremst among the eloquent! O Indra! If you have affection in me, I shall
speak out my words. Make my words real."
"Let all the monkeys, who reached the abode of death, after displaying their
energyfor
"O the bestower of honour! I wish to see all those monkeys, who for my sake, were
removed from their sons and wives, be delighted at heart."
"They were all valiant, proving their energies and did not take their death into
account. They made their strenuous efforts and died. O Indra! Restore their lives to them."
"Those mokeys - who coutned death as nothing and who were fond of doing favour to me
- let them get re-united with their near and dear ones by your grace. I seek this boon of you."
"O bestower of honour! I wish to see the monkeys and bears, free from wounds and
pains, with augmented strength and valour."
"Wherever the aforesaid monkeys live, let there be rivers with crystal-clear water,
flowers, roots and fruits even in an off-season."
Hearing the words of that great-souled Rama, Indra the lord of celestials endowed as
he was with delight, again spoke the following words:
"O beloved Rama! This boon, which has been sought by you is hard to grant. No offer
has, however, been revised by me in the past. Therefore this will come to be."
"Let all those monkeys and bears along with long-tailed monkeys, who have been
killed in battle, by the demons and whose heads and arms have been severed, be alive and active
again."
"Without any ill-health andwounds and with boosted strength and valour, the monkeys
will srise again, as those fallen asleep would do at the end of their sleep."
"All of them, full of delight, will get re-united with their friends, relatives,
kinsmen and family members."
"O the wielder of a great bow! The trees will look colourful with flowers and fruits
even in the off-season. Rivers too will remain constantly with water."
Thereupon, all those monkey-warriors got up, as if from a sleep, with all their
limbs completely healed of wounds. All the monkeys felt surprised, saying to one another "What
miracle is this?"
Seeing Rama, whose wish has been fully realised, all the foremost of celestials,
with a great delight, spoke praisingly to Rama and Lakshmana:
"O monarch! Proceed to Ayodhya from here and disband the monkeys. Reassure this
illustrious and devoted Seetha."
"O destroyer of adversaries! See Bharata, your brother, who is practising
austerities through grief caused by separation from you, the great-souled Shatrughna and all your
mohters. Get yourself consecrated on the throne. Bring rejoice to the citizens, by going
there."
Thus speaking to Rama and Lakshmana, Idnra the thousand-eyed god of celestials,
having beenpleased, returned to heaven with other gods in their aerial cars, shining liek the
sun.
having respectfully saluted all those celestials, Rama along with Lakshmana his
brother, then instructed all the monkeys to take rest in their respective places.
Thereupon, that illustrious and mighty army of rejoiced troops, for its part, whichw
as protected by Lakshmana and Rama, and was blazing with splendour on all sides, shone brightly
like the might, illumined by the moon.While those monkeys and demons were fighting, the sun sank below the horizon,
setting in motion a night of carnage.
Then, a nocturnal was commenced between the terrific monkeys and demons, who
contracted hostility with each other, wishing for their victory.
"You are a demon" said the monkeys "You are a monkey" said the demons and killed at
each other in battle; during that dreadful darkness.
"Strike!" "Tear asunder!" "come near!" "Why are you running away?" - very tumultuous
sounds like this could be heard in that army.
The black demons in that darkness, wearing golden mails, were appearing as mountains
with groves of medicinal plants emitting their light.
In that darkness, which was difficult to be overcome, the demons agitated as they
were with anger, attacked with great speed, duly destroying the monkeys.
Those strong monkeys with a terrific rage leapt forward and tore asunder by their
sharp teeth, the steeds with gold ornaments on their head, the serpentine banners and frightened
the demoniac army.
Agitated with anger, the monkeys dragged the elephants and those mounted on them and
also the chariots with their banners and flag-staffs duly breaking them to pieces with their
teeth.
Rama and Lakshmana killed the foremost of the demons, both those who were visible
and those who were invisible, with their arrows resembling venomous snakes.
The dust rising from the hooves of horses and the wheels of the chariots blocked the
ears and the eyes of the combatants.
While that terrible battle was taking place, causing the hair to bristle; very
terrible rivers with streams of blood were flowing there.
There arose a marvelous sound of kettle drums and tabors, mixed with the sounds of
counches, fellies of chariot-wheels and drums.
There appeared a terrific sound resonated by horses, demons and monkeys being
wounded.
The assassinated great monkeys, spears, maces, axes and the slaughtered demons, who
were able to change their form at will and with their bodies appearing like mountains were lying
there on the battle-field. And those weapons appeared to be offered up as a profusion of flowers by
the earth, which became hidden and rendered impassable by the slime formed out of streams of
blood.
That fatal night became as calamitous to the monkeys and demons, as a night of
dissolution, which is difficult to be overcome by all beings.
In that very terrible darkness, those demons thrilling with rapture attacked Rama
with showers of arrows.
Yelling in fury, the sound of those demons approaching in order to assault Rama was
like the noise of the oceans at the time of destruction of all the creatures.
Within a twinkling of an eye, Rama with six sharp arrows resembling tongues of
flame, struck down six of those demons.
The unconquerable Yagnashatru, Mahaparashva, Mahodara, the giant bodied
Vajradamshtra, both Shuka and Sarana - all those six having been beaten by Rama on their vital
organs with a flood of his arrows, retreated from the battle and somehow survived for the rest of
their life.
Rama the great warrior, merely within an instant, made the quarters and the
intermediate quarters, clear of all the demons, by his arrows resembling flames of fire.
The other valiant demons, who were standing with their face turning towards Rama,
also perished like moths, having encountered the same fire.
That night, with the golden shafts of arrows, flying on all sides, appeared
bright-coloured, like an autumnal night with its fire-flies on all sides.
The terrible night on that day became more terrible again by the sound of
kettle-drums and by the roaring sounds of the demons.
By that great sound, which re-echoed on all sides, the mountain Trikuta, full of
caves, appeared to be uttering confused murmurs.
Long-tailed and black faced monkeys with their gigantic bodies and dark-like figure,
crushed the demons with their arms and allowed them to be eaten (by jackals, vultures etc).
Angada on his part, who came to annihilate the enemies in that battle-field, struck
Indrajit, his charioteer and the horses all at once.
While that awful and very intense battle was going on, Indrajit a great trickster,
leaving the chariot, with its horses and charioteer killed by Angada, vanished from that very spot
itself.
All the celestials, both Rama and Lakshmana together with all sages were pleased
with that act of the venerable Angada the son of Vali.
Since all the living beings knew the supernatural powers of Indrajit in battle, they
were pleased on seeing that highly gifted demon being defeated by Angada.
Seeing the enemy defeated, those monkeys along with Sugreeva and Vibhishana were
delighted and praised Angada as an efficient warrior.
Indrajit, on the other hand, then was driven to a very terrible rage, as he was
defeated in battle by Angada the son of Vali a dreadful monkey.
That Indrajit the son of Ravana, the sinful demon who had gone out of sight and was
cruel in battle, rendered himself as invisible again and hurled forth sharp arrows, bright as
lightning.
Being enraged in battle, Indrajit bursted out serpent-like terrible arrows into all
the limbs of Rama and Lakshmana who were born in Raghu dynasty.
Enveloped by illusion, he sought to confuse Rama and Lakshmana in the struggle there
and invisible to all beings through his magic arts, Indrajit the ranger of the night bound those
two brothers Rama and Lakshmana with a net work of arrows.
Then, the monkeys saw the two warriors, those lions among men, being wounded quickly
by the serpentine arrows of that enraged demons.
Not being able to hurt those two princes in his manifest form, Indrajit the son of
the king of demons with his perverse mind, had recourse to magic in order to make them captive.Carefully hearing the words of Vibhishana, whose intellect was equal to that of
Brihaspati (god Of wisdom and eloquence) the high spirited Indrajit, the chief of army of demons
spoke as follows:
"O, youngest uncle! Pray, what? Your words are meaningless and very much
frightening. Even he who is not born in this race would neither speak such words nor do such a
thing (as you suggest)."
"In our race, this Vibhishana the youngest uncle is the only individual lacking in
strength, heroism, prowess, courage, valor and vital powers" W.w m.
"What after all are those princes who are mere human beings? They can be killed even
by one very ordinary demon among us. O, coward! Why are you frightening us? "
"At one time, the competent Devendra, the lord of three worlds, was indeed tossed
down on the floor by me. All the flocks of celestials were cast into fear and all of them fled to
different quarters."
"Airavata (Indra`s elephant), which was making noise discordantly, was hurled down
by me on the floor. I forcibly extracted its teeth and frightened the entire flock of
celestials."
"How can I, with great valor, who suppressed the arrogance of even the celestials
and who made the lives of even excellent of the demons miserable, not capable of conquering the two
princes who are ordinary human beings?"
Hearing those words of Indrajit, who was equal to Indra (god of celestials),
dangerous to be approached, and possessing great vital power, Vibhishana the excellent one among
bearers of weapons spoke then the following highly meaningful words:
"O, child! There is no stability of thought in you. Being a boy, you are still
immature in mind. That is why, many a meaningless word was prattled by you too, for only your
self-destruction."
"In the guise of a son, O, Indrajit, you are an enemy of Ravana putting on the mask
of a well wisher in that even hearing (from me) of his destruction at the hands of Rama, you are
blindly agreeing with him."
"You surely are fit to be killed. Nay, he too is fit to be killed, who brought you,
a reckless boy here today and ushered you foolishly in the proximity of counselors".
"O, Indrajit! You are a stupid, irresolute, without humility, rude natured; unwise;
evil person, inexperienced and highly evil minded. You are speaking in this manner because you are
an immature boy".
"Who can endure the arrows, discharged by Rama in battle right in front of the
enemy, which resemble Brahma's (creator's) staff in glory, which present a form similar to that of
God of Death and are equal to the Yama's staff?"
" O, king! Offering riches, precious stones, good jewellery, excellent clothes,
bright colored gems and the god-like Sita to Rama, let us live here, free from anguish."In that situation, Vibhishana then spoke the following words, which were hostile to
the enemies and advantageous to Lakshmana.
"Let this army of demons which is seen here, dark as a cloud, be quickly engaged in
battle, by the monkeys using rocks as thier weapons."
"O Lakshmana! Make an effort to break this mighty army. When this army is destroyed,
Indrajit also will become visible."
"You as such, rush forward quickly, gushing out arrows, equal to Indra's
thunderbolt, on the enemies, so long as this sacrificial act of Indrajit is not actually carried
through."
"O hero! Make a short work of Indrajit, the evil minded, who is interested in
performing conjuring tricks, who is unjust, engaged in cruel acts and who brings fear to all the
worlds."
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, showered forth
streams of arrows in the direction of Indrajit.
Bears and monkeys, who fight was gigantic trees, rushed towards that army of demons,
drawn up in battle-array.
The demons too, with an intent to kill the monkeys in battle, attacked them with
sharp arrows, sowrds, spears and javelins.
That tumultuous battle between the monkeys and the demons rendered Lanka noisy on
all sides with its great uproar.
The sky was covered with weapons of various shapes, sharp arrows, trees and tossed
mountain tops.
Those demons of ugly faces and arms, hurling weapons on the monkeys, created a great
fear.
Even the monkeys too struck and killed all the demons in the battle, with various
types of trees and mountain-peaks.
A great fear developed among the demons who were fighting with mighty leaders of
bears and monkeys endowed with colossal bodies.
Hearing that his own army being tormented by the enemies, was dejected; that
unconquerable Indrajit left off, without performing the sacrificial rite.
That enraged Indrajit, coming out from the gloominess of the trees, ascended his
firmly yoked chariot which had already been united
That awful Indrajit, armed with terrific bow and arrows, looking like a mass of
black collyrium with his blood-red eyes, appeared like the destructive Death.
Just on seeing Indrajit being on a chariot, that army of demons with a terrific
speed, turned back, wishing to fight with Lakshmana.
At that time, Hanuma the destroyer of enemies looking like a mountain, uplifted an
absolutely unpaalleled large tree. Consuming that army of demons, as a fire at the time of
universal dissolution, the aforesaid monkey made that army unconscious on the battle field, with
many trees.
Immediately on seeing Hanuma destroying thier army rapidly, thousands of demons
hurled weapons on him.
Approaching Hanuma looking like a mountain, the demons bearing pointed pikes struck
him from all sides with pkes, those carrying swords in their hands with swords, those carring
javelins in their hands with jalins, with iron rods with maces; those armed with sharp-edged spears
with spears, as also with bright-looking spears, with hundreds of cylindrical wooden pieces studded
with iron spikes, with steel hammers, ,with awful axes, with slings for the rwing stones, with
their thunderbolt-like fists and slaps which fell like flashes of lighning. Then, the enraged
Hanuma made a colossal destruction of those demons.
That Indrajit saw Hanuma, the foremost of monkeys, looking like a mountain,
fearlessly killing his enemies.
He spoke the following words tohis charioteer: "Take the chariot to the place where
that monkey is standing. If we neglect him, he will surely destroy our demons."
Hearing the words of that Indrajit, the charioteer went, carrying that very
unconquerable Indrajit sitting in the chariot, to the place where Hanuma was there.
Coming close to Hanuma, that unconquerable Indrajit hurled swords, sharp-edged
spears and axes on the head of Hanuma.
Receiving those terrible weapons, that Hanuma spoke, seized as he was, with great
rage, the following words:
"O evil-minded Indrajit! If you are valiant, fight with me. Coming nearer to Hanuma,
you will not return alive."
"O foolish fellow! If you enter into a duel with me, fight with your arms. Withstand
my force in the battle-field. Then you will be considered as the best among the demons."
Vibhishana told Lakshmana in the following words that while with bow upraised,
Indrajit sought to kill Hanuma.
"Having seated in a chariot, Indrajit, who conquered Indra, is seeking to kill
Hanuma."
"O Lakshmana! Kill that Indrajit with your terrific arrows of incomparable
workmanship, which ward off the enemies and putting an end to their lives."
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, who was fearful to his adversaries, the
great-souled Lakshmana saw Indrajit, who closely resembled a mountain, seated in a chariot, of
terrific strength and who was difficult to approach.Guessing the mind of that great-souled Rama, Indrajit turning away from that battle,
entered the City.
Then, recalling the killing of those energetic demons like Kumbhakarna and others,
that valiant Indrajit sallied forth (for the fight) with red-hot eyes in anger.
That Indrajit, of very great prowess, the adversary of gods and who was born in Sage
Pulstya's dynasty, accompanied by an army of demons, came forth from the western gate.
Seeing the two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshamana, who were prepared for the
encounter, Indrajit for his part, then started to demonstrate his conjuring tricks.
Placing an illusory image of Seetha on his chariot and a large army surrounding the
chariot, Indrajit intended to kill her.
Making up his mind to purposefully confuse all, by playing a trick to kill Seetha's
illusory image, the exceedingly evil-minded Indrajit sallied forth towards the direction of the
monkeys.
Seeing him coming forth towards their direction, all those monkeys were enraged and
bounced towards him, with rocks in their hands and with an intent to fight.
Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, taking hold of a very large mountain-peak,
which was difficult to be reached by others, marched in front.
That Hanuma saw Seetha, the wife of Rama, the best among women, bereft of joy,
wearing only a single braid of hair, looking miserable, with her face emaciated due to fasting,
dressed in a single worn-out clothing, unadorned and with all her limbs covered with dust and dirt;
in the chaiot of Indrajit.
On seeing her for a moment, Hanuma ascertained her as Seetha and became dejected.
That Seetha was indeed seen by him, not long ago.
Seeing her stricken with grief bereft of joy, looking distreseed, miserable and
sitting under the sway of Indrajit, Hanuma wondered as to what his intention might be. Thus
thinking, he along with those leaders of mnkeys, rushed towards Indrajit.
Beholding that army of monkeys, Indrajit was excited with anger, pulled Seetha by
the hair on her head and unsheathed his sword.
While those monkeys were seeing, demon began to strike that woman who was placed in
the chariot by the dint of his conjuring trick and who was crying "Rama! Rama!"
On seeing her seized by the hair Hanuma the son of wind-god was confounded with
affliction and shed tears, in agony from his eyes.
On seeing Seetha with all her charming limbs, the beloved wife of Rama, Hanuma
angrily addressed the foolowing harsh words to Indrajit:
"O evil minded one! Born in a dynasty of Brahmanical sages, but belonging to
demoniacal race, you touched a lock of her hair, for your hair, for your own ruin."
"O cruel, vulgar and mean fellow! O wicked demon of sinful prowess! O pitiless
fellow! Woe be to you, of sinful conduct, in whom such a resolve has taken place. Such an act is
worthy of a barbarian. There is no pity in you."
"O pitiless one! Seetha came away from her house, from her kingdom and from her
huband's (Rama's) protection. What wrong has Seetha done to you, that you are killing her?"
"By killing Seetha, you will not survivie for long in any way. O demon, desrving of
death! By your act, you indeed fell into my hands."
"Abandoning your life in this world, you shall, after death, descend to those worlds
which are the lot of the killers of women and are condemned even by those who deserved to be killed
by the people."
Thus speaking, Hanuma surrounded as he was by monkeys with their weapons and very
much enraged, rushed headlong towards Indrajit.
The army of demons of terrible rage intercepted that army of mokeys possessing a
high prowess and advancing towards them.
Stirring up that army of mokeys with a multitude of his arrows, Indrajit replied to
Hanuma, the foremost of mokeys as follows:
"For whose sake, Sugreeva, yourself and Rama came here, I am going to kill Seetha
now itself, while you stand looking on."
"O monkey! After killing her, I will make a short work of Rama, Lakshmana, yourself
too, Sugreeva and that vulgar Vibhishana thereafter."
"O monkey! What you have said just now viz. that women are not to be killed, is
correct. But that which causes tormentation to the enemies indeed needs to be done."
Having spoken thus to Hanuma, Indrajit personally killed that illusory Seetha, who
ahd been sobbing all the while, with his sharp-edged sword.
Split asunder by him diagonally, that miserable lady of broad hips and pleasant to
the sight, fell down on the ground.
After killing that woman, Indrajit told Hanuma as follows: "See, I killed Rama's
wife with my weapon. This Seetha is dead and all your labour is in vain."
After killing her with a large sword personally, that Indrajit then sitting on his
chariot, pleasurefully roared loudly.
The monkeys standing in vicinity heard his roar, even as he shouted with his mouth
wide open, while comfortable sitting in that tower of the aerial chriot, which was actually
difficult of access for others.
After killing Seetha in that way, the evil-minded Indrajit became exceedingly glad.
Seeing him exceedingly pleased, the monkeys looked dejected and suddenly ran away.After speaking to him as aforesaid, Vibhishana taking Lakshmana, who held a bow in
his hand, felt rejoiced and hastened away.
Moving not very distant from there and entering an extensive thicket, Vibhishana
showed to Lakshmana, the place where Indrajit was going to pour oblations into the sacred fire.
The glorious Vibhishana showed a terribly looking banyan tree, appearing like a
blace cloud (and spoke as follows).
"After offering oblations to the spirits at this place, the mighty Indrajit proceeds
to the battle afterwards."
"Thereupon, this demon becomes invisible to any one, kills some enemies in battle
and binds some with his excellent arrows."
"Destroy that mighty Indrajit, along with his chariot, horses and charioteer, by
releasing your blazing arrows, even while he has not reached the banyan tree."
That greatly brilliant Lakshmana, a delight of his fiends, saying 'So be it' took
his stand there, twanging his bow at full length.
That Indrajit, the son of Ravana, clad in armour, armed with a sword, and
distinguished by his ensign, appeared in a fire-coloured chariot.
That highly splendid Lakshmana spoke to that Indrajit, the scion of Sage Paulastya,
who had never been conquered before (as follows); "I am inviting you for a fight. Give battle to me
in a right manner."
Thus spoken by Lakshmana, Indrajit with a great brilliance and high mindedness,
seeing Vibhishana there, spoke the following harsh words to him:
"O demon! You are born and brought up here. You are a direct brother to my father
and a paternal uncle to me. How can you be hostile to a son?
"O perverted fellow, an abuser of righteousness! Consanguinity is not a norm for
you, nor friendliness, nor pride of birth, nor a brotherly feeling nor a right conduct."
"O evil-minded one! You are pitiable and deserve to be reproached by the virtuous,
in that having abandoned your onw kind, you have entered into the service of our enemy."
"You are not recognizing the great difference because of your feeble mind. Where is
living together with one's own kindred and where is taking refuge with low kind of enemies?
"Opponents may be virtuous. One's own kindred may not be virtuous. But, a relation,
though bereft of merit is preferable. An enemy is, indeed, ever an enemy."
"He who, abandoning his own side, takes sides with adversary, is killed, after his
own knsmen are destroyed just by those people of the other side."
"O Indrajit, the demon! The ruthlessness thus shown by you and the manliness
exhibited by you (in bringing Lakshmana here) could be possible only by you, our own kindred."
Hearing the words of Indrajit, his brother's son, Vibhishana replied: "O demon! Why
do you speak perversely, as though you are not aware of my nature."
"O Indrajit the wicked one! Atleast out of respect for the elders, abandon your
harshness. Even if I am born in a demoniac race, which does cruel acts, my nature is goodness,
which is prime virtue of human beings and it is not demoniacal."
"I neither delight in cruel acts, nor rejoice in unvirtuous acts. How can a brother
be driven away by his brother, even if the former's nature is different?"
"Renouncing a man of sinful resolve hose conduct has deviated from righteousness,
one attains happiness, as one shakes off a venomous serpent from his hand."
"The wise men say that an evil-natured fellow, who is intent on taking away other's
property and lustfully touches another's wife, is worth shunning, as one abandons a house in
flames."
"Three faults produce destruction. Taking away other's property, lustfully touching
another's wife and excessive distrust with one's friends."
"These faults which destroy one's life and lordship killing great sages terribly,
waging war against all celestials, arrogance, becoming angry very easily, quarrelsomeness, ill-will
have concealed the good qualities of my elder brother, as the clouds conceal the view of
mountains."
"Because of these vices, Ravana, your father and my brother, has been abandoned by
me. Neither will this City of Lanka will exist any longer nor you nor your father."
"O demon! You can talk to me as you like, since you are arrogant, foolish,
indisciplined and caught, as you are, in the noose of Death."
"O the worst of demons! You got this calamity here because you spoke harsh words to
me today. You cannot reach the banyan-tree any longer."
"It is not possible for you to survive, on attacking Lakshmana. You fight with
Lakshmana, the lord of men, in the battle-field. After being killed, you will do sacred work in the
abode of Yama, the god of Death."
"Do spend away all your weapons and arrows, by showing your own augmented strength.
Reaching the range of Lakshmana's arrows, you will not indeed return alive with your army
today."Indrajit, the demon, who was endowed with extraordinary energy, standing on the
ground his horses having been killed; was very much enraged and blazed with spirit.
Those two warriors, holding their bows, having an extreme intent to kill each other
with their arrows, were like two excellent elephants going out in the forest for the purpose of
conquering one over the other.
Those demons and monkeys, rushing from all sides, destroying each other, did not
desert their masters in battle.
Applauding and causing rejoice to all the demons and even feeling delighted himself,
Indrajit then spoke the following words:
"These quarters are wrapped on all sides with abundant darkness. O foremost of
demons! It can not be identified at this time whether one belongs to one's own army or an
enemy.
"You courageously fight, so as to stupefy the monkeys. I, on my part, will return to
the battle-field, ascending another chariot."
"You act in such a way so that these evil-minded monkeys do not carry on their fight
(with me) while enter the city."
Thus speaking, Indrajit the annihilator of enemies, having deceived the monkeys,
entered the City of Lanka for the sake of getting anther chariot.
Arranging for embellishment of a chariot, which was beautiful, decked with gold,
furnished with darts, swords and arrows, yoked with excellent horses, directed by a charioteer who
could understand those horses properly and could give credible instructions to them, that Indrajit,
a conqueror in battle, who was endowed with extraordinary energy, then ascended it.
That valiant Indrajit, surrounded by troops of principal demons and incited by the
force of destiny, sallied forth from the city.
Moving out form the City with his swift horses, that indrajit, the destroyer of
valiant enemies, attacked Lakshmana and Vibhishana.
Seeing Idnrajit seated in the chariot, Lakshmana, the mighty monkeys and Vibhishana
the demon then were very much surprised on recalling the alacrity of the intelligent Indrajit.
The enraged Indrajit also struck down hundreds and thousands of monkey-chiefs by
using a multitude of arrows in the battle-field.
Stretching his bow to a circle, that enraged Indrajit the conqueror in battle,
exhibiting supreme agility, began to kill the monkeys.
Thus being killed by steel arrows, those monkeys of terrible prowess sought refuge
in Lakshmana, as people would take refuge in Brahma the Lord of Creation.
Then, blazing with hostile anger, Lakshmana, showing his agility of hand, tore
Indrajit's bow.
Hurriedly, he took another bow and made it ready. Lakshmana tore that bow too of
Indrajit with three arrows.
Thereupon, Lakshmana struck that Indrajit, whose bow was torn, on his chest with
five arrows which were deadly like a serpentine poison.
Those arrows, released from that great bow, penetrating through Indrajit's body,
fell to the ground like huge red serpents.
Ejecting blood from his month, that Indrajit, who had his bow torn, took hold of his
excellent bow with the bow-string firmly fastened and which was stronger than the earlier bow.
Employing utmost agility, Indrajit, aiming at Lakshmana, streamed forth a shower of
arrows, as Indra the lord of celestials streaming forth the rain.
Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies coolly warded off the shower of arrows released
by Indrajit, though it was most difficult to resist.
Lakshmana with great splendor, remaining unperplexed, then showed his prowess to
Indrajit, which was marvelous indeed.
Getting extremely enraged, Lakshmana then pierced all those demons who stood in the
battle-field with three arrows each, showing his speed in discharging missiles and also struck
Indrajit with an array of arrows.
That Indrajit, who was struck by the enemy, who was mighty destroyer of enemies,
released several arrows unhindered towards Lakshmana.
Lakshmana, the destroyer of valiant adversaries, tore those arrows yet unarrived,
with sharp arrows. The virtuous Lakshmana eliminated the head of the charioteer of Indrajit, the
chariot-warrior, in the battle with an arrow called Bhalla which was looking curved at its
nodes.
Those horses, bereft of a charioteer there, without getting perturbed, ran up in a
circular fashion and continued to draw the chariot. The scene looked wonderful indeed.
Getting the power of anger, Lakshmana of unyielding prowess, pierced the horses of
Indrajit with arrows, so as to frighten them thereby.
Getting impatient with that act of Lakshmana in battle, Indrajit struck that enraged
Lakshmana with ten arrows.
Those arrows of Indrajit, equal to thunderbolts and deadly as serpentine poison,
having reached Lakshmana's armour with a golden hue, got destroyed.
Understanding Lakshmana to have been protected by an impenetrable armour and showing
his swiftness in discharging missiles, Indrajit the son of Ravana, who felt very much angered,
pierced Lakshmana in the forehead with three arrows provided with good plumes.
With those three arrows planted in his forehead, Lakshmana who was fond of fighting,
shone like a mountain with its three peaks, in the battle-field.
Thus tormented in battle by Indrajit the demon, that Lakshmana then quickly
stretching the bow, pierced him in return with five arrows, in battle, in Indrajit's face holding
beautiful ear-rings.
Lakshmana Indrajit, the heroes endowed with extraordinary might and armed with very
strong bows and possessing terrible prowess, struck each other with distinctly pointed arrows.
Those two warriors, Lakshmana and Indrajit, with both their bodies stained in blood,
shone in the battle-field at that time, like Kimshuka trees in blossom.
Those two archers, with their minds directed towards victory, met each other and
pierced their opponent in all limbs with dreadful arrows.
Then, Indrajit, filled with martial anger, struck Vibhishana in his auspicious face,
with three arrows.
Having struck Vibhishana, the leader of demons, with three arrows, Indrajit struck
all those monkey chiefs with a single arrow each.
Very much enraged with him, that Vibhishana of great splendor killed the horses of
that evil-minded Indrajit with his mace.
Just leaping down from the chariot whose charioteer was destroyed earlier and whose
horses were killed, that Indrajit of great splendor employed his javelin towards his maternal
uncle.
Seeing that Javelin rushing towards Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it into ten pieces
with his sharp arrows and felled it on the floor.
The strong bodied Vibhishana, in anger, dug five arrows, whose impact was a hard as
that of a thunder-bolt, into the bosom of Indrajit, whose horses were already killed.
Having penetrated his body, those arrows which were provided with golden feathers,
went straight into their target, got stained with blood and appeared like red large serpents.
Enraged with his paternal uncle, that Indrajit, standing in the midst of demons,
took hold of an excellent arrow earlier presented by Yama the lord of Death.
Seeing that great arrow seized by him, Lakshmana also, of great splendor and
terrible prowess, took hold of another arrow.
That arrow had been presented to him, in the course of a dream, by Kubera the god of
riches, of immense glory himself, which was difficult to be conquered and much more difficult to be
tolerated even for gods and demons including Indra the lord of celestials.
Stretched with strength by their arms, which resembled a pair of steel rods, emitted
a piercing sound like that of a pair of curlew-cranes.
The excellent arrows fitted and pulled out from their excellent bow by those heroes,
blazed very much with splendour.
Those arrows, released from the bow, making the sky shine and hitting each other
face to face, collided each other powerfully.
The collision of those arrows of terrible form broke out a fierce fire comprising of
smoke and sparkles.
Hitting each other like two major planets, those two arrows in battle burst into a
hundred pieces and fell on the ground.
On seeing their arrows warded off in the battle-front, those two warriors, Lakshmana
and Indrajit then felt abashed and got provoked.
Getting excited, Lakshmana took hold of a missile presided over by Varuna (the god
of water). Skilled in warfare, the great Indrajit too discharged a missile presided over by Rudra
(the god of destruction) in battle.
By that Rudra missile, that very wonderful Varuna-missile was struck. Then, that
enraged Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battle, looking like the destroyer of the
world, employed a missile presided over by Agni the god of fire which was blazing.
The valiant Lakshmana obstructed Agni-missile, by a missile presided over by the
sun-god. Finding his missile repelled, Indrajit was filled with anger and took hold of a sharp
arrow used by demons and capable of tearing down an enemy.
From that bow, blazing weapon similar to a hammer duly hidden, darts, fire arms,
maces, swords and axes rushed forth.
Seeing that terrible missile, which was very harsh, unrestrainable for all beings
and which can tear all weapons in battle, the brilliant Lakshmana obstructed that missile by using
Maheswara-missile.
There was a wonderful battle between both of them, causing hair to stand erect. The
beings in the sky surrounded Lakshmana.
Surrounded by many surprised beings in that terrible battle taking place between
monkeys and demons, yielding terrific noise, the sky sparkled.
Placing Indra the lord of celestials as their head, the sages, manes, gods,
Gandharvas the celestial musicians, eagles and serpents protected Lakshmana in the
battle-field.
Then, Lakshmana fitted another excellent arrow, which had a sensation of ignition
and which can tear down Indrajit.
The heroic Lakshmana fitted the arrow, having beautiful plumes, which consisted of
rounded parts, well-jointed, skillfully fashioned, decked with gold, capable of destroying the body
of the enemies, not difficult to keep off but difficult even to tolerate, a source of terror to the
demons as deadly as the venom of poisonous snakes and duly honoured by the host of gods.
With the help of that arrow, the highly powerful and valiant Indra, the lord of
celestials, who had green horses to his chariot, was able to conquer the demons in a combat which
raged between celestials and demons.
Fitting a missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, which had never
been defeated in battle, to his excellent bow and drawing it, the glorious Lakshmana addressed the
following prayer, which was intended to achieve his purpose:
"O my dear arrow! If Rama the son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue, keeps up
his promise and is second to none in his prowess, destroy this Indrajit."
Thus saying and drawing up to the ear the arrow, which went straight, the heroic
Lakshmana released it towards Indrajit.
75. tat mahat shiraH= that large head; raakShasatanuujasya= of Indrajit; bhinna
skandham= separated from his trunk; rudhirokShitam= and moistened with blood; dadR^ishe= appeared;
bhuumau= on the ground; tapaniiya nibham= shining like gold.
That large head of Indrajit, separated from his trunk and moistened with blood, was
seen on the ground, shining like gold.
Having been killed, that Indrajit then forthwith fell to the ground, along with his
armour and head-protector, with his bow shattered.
As Indrajit was killed, all those monkeys together with Vibhishana roared in
rejoice, as the celestials did, when Vritra the demon was killed.
Then, a shout of victory rose in the sky from the mouth of gods, great-souled sages,
Gandharvas the celestial musicians and the celestial nymphs.
Seeing him fallen, that great army of demons, being struck by monkeys shining with
victory, sought the quarters.
Abandoning their weapons, while being struck by the monkeys, those demons went
towards Lanka, running fast stupefied.
All those frightened demons, abandoning their weapons sharp-edged spears, swords and
axes ran away in hundreds to various directions.
Tormented by the monkeys, some were scared and entered Lanka. Some fell into the
ocean. Some took refuge in the mountain.
Seeing Indrajit killed and lying on the battle-field, not even one among the
thousands of demons was to be seen.
As the sun-rays do not exist when the sun has sunk below the horizon, so those
demons left to different directions when Indrajit had fallen.
Thrown asunder and dead, that long-armed Indrajit looked like the sun whose rays
have cooled down and like the fire which is extinguished.
When Indrajit was fallen, the world then had its oppressions pacified, now that its
enemy had been destroyed and it experience a rejoice.
While that demon of sinful deeds is having been killed, the illustrious Indra the
ruler of gods along with all the great sages were rejoiced.
In the sky too was heard the sound of large drums played by celestials, the melody
produced by dancing Apsaras the celestial nymphs and the songs of Gandharvas the celestial
musicians.
While that demon of cruel deeds was killed, a deluge of flowers rained along with
showers of praises. It was a wonderful scene.
While that Indrajit, who was the terror of all the worlds, had fallen, the waters
and the sky became clear. The celestials and demons were rejoiced and arrived on the scene.
The gratified celestials, Gandharvas the celestial musicians and the demons said:
"Let the Brahmanas move about cheerfully, now that their trouble has ceased."
Seeing that foremost among demons, who was unrivalled in battle, having been killed,
the rejoiced monkey-chiefs applauded Lakshmana.
Vibhishana, Hanuma and Jambavan the chief of bears were pleased at Lakshmana for his
victor and applauded him too.
The monkeys, who accomplished their aim, roaring, jumping with joy and emitting
thundering sounds, stood encircling Lakshmana.
Wagging their tails and lashing them, the monkeys then gave forth the slogan,
"Victorious is Lakshmana!"
Embracing each other with rejoiced minds, the monkeys indulged in good conversations
about Lakshmana and his manifold qualities.
Hearing Indrajit having been killed and witnessing that arduous act of Lakshmana,
their beloved friend in battle, the celestials were gratified and experienced a great rejoice in
their minds.That Hanuma who could assume any desired form, searching among houses had a lot of
grief. Endowed with great speed, He roamed again the city of Lanka.
After that, the glorious Hanuma neared the house of Ravana shining with the golden
the hue of the Sun, surrounded by a compound wall.
Hanuma shined purveying the building protected by horrible rakshasas, like a forest
by lions.
Ravana's house consisted of surprising archways decorated with silver and gold,
strange entrances and beautiful doors.
Ravana's house was waited upon by men on elephants, warriors, and people with removed
tiredness, drivers of elephants, by undefeatable horses, and by charioteers.
Hanuma saw Ravana's house with protective shields made of lion and tiger skins,
decorated with ivory, gold and silver, being roamed always by strange chariots with great
sound.
Hanuma saw Ravana's house filled with a lot of diamonds, having valuable seats and
utensils, abode of great warriors, with great chariots and great utensils.
Filled all around with those and various kinds of animals and birds in
thousands, lovely to watch - very beautiful ones.
Well protected by well-trained rakshasas, protecting the inner area, filled all over
by best women who were important.
Having happy women, the abode of Ravana with the tinkling of best jewellery had a
sound like that of an ocean.
Together with royal insignia, with best scents and sandal wood, spread with great
number of people like a great forest with lions.
Resounded by Chris and mridangam, resounded by the sound of conch shells, prayed
upon daily by Rakshsas, with rituals on festivals, always worshipped by rakshasas.
The great Hanuma saw the wealthy Ravana's huge house, inscrutable like an ocean,
like a noiseless ocean, with a roof embedded with great diamonds and filled with great diamonds.
That great Hanuma thought the house, which was shining with its form filled with
elephants, horses, and chariots, to be the jewel of Lanka. Hanuma walked about there in the near-hood
of Ravana.
That Hanuma moved about from one house to another of Rakshasas and also parks and
observing in all directions without fear and also courtyards.
Hanuma with great prowess, and with great speed, jumped for the house of
Prahasta and from there leapt for another house that of Mahaparshva.
Thereafter the great Hanuma leapt for the house of Kumbhakarna which resembled a
cloud and in the same way for the house of Vibhishana.
That great Hanuma in the same way leapt for the house of Mahodara and also that of
Virupaaksha, that of Viddutjihva.
Hanuma the commander of the Vanara army with great radiance went for the intellectual
Suka's house, Sarana's house, and in the same way for the house of Indrajit.
The best among Vanaras Hanuma went for the house of Jambumali and the house of
Sumali. The great Hanuma jumped for the house Rasmiketu and in the same way for the house of
Suryaketu and in that way for the building of Vajrakaaya.
Hanuma jumped for Dhumrah's house, Sampati's house, Vidhudrupa's, Bhiima's
house, for Ghana's house and Vighana's house, for Sukhana's house, for Vakra's, for Satha's house
and also for Vikata's house, for Brahmakarna's house, for Damshra's house, for Roma's house, for
Raksha's house, for Ydhonmata's and Indrajihva's house, in the same way for Hastimukas house, for
Karala's house, Pisacha's house, and also the building of Shonita.
The son of Vayu, one with great fame, a great one among Vanaras, moving about in a
sequence in those and those best buildings, saw the wealth of those rakshasas, who were rich.
The glorious Hanuma passing everyone's houses all around, there-after neared the
house of Ravana.
Hanuma best among Vanaras, tiger among Vanaras, moving about saw Rakshas women,
those who were sleeping near Ravana, those who had horrific eyes, those who had Sulaas, Mudgaras
in their hands, those who had Shaktis and Tomaras.
Hanuma saw in that house of Ravana a variety of army divisions and also Rakshasas
those who had huge bodies having different weapons raised.
That Hanuma in that house saw horses in red colour and white colour, slightly
whitish, capable of great speed, elephants born in a good breed having good appearance capable of
harassing enemy's elephants, skilled in good elephant training, equalling Iraavata, capable of
killing enemies' armies in war, rutting like raining clouds, like mountains with waterfalls that
are pouring down, with trumpeting resembling thundering of clouds, unassailable by enemies in a
battle.
There Hanuma saw in the house of Ravana, the king of rakshasas, army divisions in
thousands decorated with gold, covered with heaps of gold, equalling the Sun who has fully come
up.
That Hanuma the son of Vayu saw in the house of Ravana the king of rakshasas,
palanquins of various shapes, wonderful bowers, art galleries and other pleasure houses which were
constructed with wooden mountains, a house for sexual delight and a beautiful diurnal house.
That Hanuma saw the best among buildings equalling Mount Mandara filled with pens
for peacocks, spread by flag staffs managed by courageous ones like the house of Kubera filled with
many diamonds and also heaps of riches.
That building shone by the rays of diamonds, by the splendour of Ravana like the Sun
by rays.
Hanuma leader of Vanaras saw couches and seats and chief vessels all made with
gold.
Hanuma entered the big house moistened by liquor made of honey, filled with vessels
made of gems delightful, un-congested like the building of Kubera resounded by the sound of
tinkles by the sound of waist ornaments, by the sound of percussion on Mrudangas with deep sound,
which consisted of many mansions filled with hundreds of the best women, encircled by many spacious
enclosures.
Thus, this is the th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, 
			Vishvamitra wrathfully replied this sentence to the king. 
"On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate 
			it now, undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty. 
			
"If this is worth while to you, oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and 
			you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy with your kinsmen." So said 
			Vishvamitra to the king. 
When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth 
			trembled and the gods are scared. 
On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, 
			Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these 
			words to the king. 
"Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, 
			a staunch one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it 
			will be unapt of you to forsake ethics." 
"In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence 
			adhere to your own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt 
			of you. 
"Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word 
			results in the perdition to the merits ofiSTaapuurtaVedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, leave hold of Rama. 
"Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long 
			as Kushi's son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects 
			divine nectar. 
"He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect 
			among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis. 
"He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other person is there in the 
			triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable 
			about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself. 
			
"While Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, can anybody from sages - no; immortals- no; demons 
			- no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together with the kinnaraa-s and great 
			reptile beings - no, they cannot know him. 
"All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaashva 
			Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva 
			gave them to Vishvamitra when was ruling kingdom. 
"Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati's daughters and her husband 
			Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, 
			and victory-oriented missiles. 
"Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists 
			gave birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme. 
"On getting a boon Jaya named wife of Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty 
			best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for the destruction of ungodly 
			beings. 
"Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another fifty unassailable, 
			unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators. 
"And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this 
			principled one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles. 
"Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, 
			who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either that has happened 
			or that is happening. 
"Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has this sort 
			of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama's accompanying 
			the sage will be unapt of you. 
"This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, 
			but intending to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring 
			upon you. 
Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded 
			by sage Vashishta's words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has 
			pronounced renown, that Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to 
			the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra. A brahmana called Jabali spoke the following unrighteous words to Rama, who knew
righteousness and who was assuaging Bharata as aforesaid "Enough, O Rama! Let not your wisdom be rendered void like a common man, you who are distinguished for your intelligence and virtue."
"Who is related to whom? What is there to be obtained by anything and by whom? Every creature is born alone and dies alone."
"O, Rama! He who clings to another, saying, 'This is my father, this is my mother, he should be known as one who has lost his wits. There is none who belongs to another."
"O, Rama! As one who passes the a strange village spends the night the and the next day leaves that place and continues his journey, so are mother, father, home and possessions to aman; they are but a resting place. The wise do not become attached to them".
"O, chief of men! You as such should not abandon your father's kingdom in order to dwell in a lonely forest, that is excruciating hard to traverse and full of thorny thickets."
"Get yourself crowned in the prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya. That city is waiting for you, with your locks duly unfound."
"O, prince! Enjoy the royal luxuries worthy of you. Move around in Ayodhya as Indra the Lord of celestials does in heaven!"
"Dasaratha is none to you nor you in anyway to him. That king is another and your
are another. Hence, do what is told by me?"
"The father is only the seed of a being. The sperm and the ovum blend at the right time in the mother's womb, so that a human being is born in this world."
"The king has gone, where he had to go. This is the fate of all being unnecessarily, you are still frustrated over the matter."
"I pity all those whosoever, devoted to wealth and religious merit, not other (who are devoted to sense-enjoyment), for, they, having undergone suffering in this life, have met with extermination after death."
"These people say, 'The eighth day should be given up to sacrifices for the spirits of our ancestors.' See the waste of food. What will a dead man eat?"
"If food eaten by one here, reaches another's body, then let a sacrifice be offered for those who are setting out on a distant journey. Will it not become a food on their path?"
"Perform sacrifices, distribute gifts, consecrate yourselves, practise ansterity and renunciation' - These writings are composed by learned men for the sake of inducing others to give."
"O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our knowledge."
"Honour the judgment of the wise and regarding that which is approved by all, accept the kingdom as propitiated by Bharata."Thereafter, the mighty monkeys, headed by Hanuma and others, experienced a great joy 
on that summit of Mount Mahendra.
Then, Jambavan, thrilling with rapture, asked the delighted Hanuma, the great monkey 
about the particulars of that actual occurrence (of seeing Seetha) as follows
"How did you see Seetha? How was she there? How was that Ravana of terrible deeds behaving 
towards her?"
"O Hanuma! Tell us entirely, in truth whatever has occurred. Ascertaining the truth, 
from you, we shall again think about what decision to be taken further."
"When we go there (to the presence of Rama), having prudence, tell us clearly which matter 
is to be disclosed and which matter is to be kept off from him."
Thus commanded by Jambavan, Hanuma, with his hair standing on end mentally offered his 
salutation to Seetha, the princess, by bowing his head and replied as follows:
"To reach the southern shore of the ocean, I leaped into the sky, indeed 
before your presence, from the summit of Mount Mahendra."
"While I was going, a terrific hindrance occurred in my way as it was. I saw a golden 
mountain-peak which was so charming and fascinating."
"I accounted that mountain staying turned towards the path, as an impediment. Approaching 
that excellent charming and golden mountain, I made up my mind to shatter it."
"As I struck it with my tail, the mountain-peak of that great hill, resembling the sun, 
was broken into a thousand pieces."
"Understanding my purpose, that great mountain spoke the following sweet words saying, 
'O my son!', As though it was refreshing my mind (once more to proceed further)."
" 'Know me to be generally called as Mynaa dwelling in this great ocean, as a companion 
of the wind-god and even as your father's brother'."
" 'O my son! Long ago, the foremost among the mountains used to have wings. They used 
to wander the entire earth freely, hurting the people!"
" 'Hearing that behavior of those mountains, the venerable Indra the lord of celestials, 
the destroyer of a demon called Paka, chopped their wings into a thousand pieces by using his thunderbolt.' 
"
" 'O child! I, on my part, was hurled into the great ocean by the high-souled wind-god, 
your father, and was liberated from the clutches of Indra.' "
" 'O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! I have to behave in such a way as to help Rama. 
For, Rama, having a prowess equal to that of Indra; is indeed excellent in supporting righteousness.'"
"Hearing the words of that high-souled Mynaka and after informing my purpose, my mind 
was prepared for further travel. The high-soled Mynaka also allowed me to depart."
"That Mynaka mountain vanished in the guise of a beautiful form of a human being. That 
large mountainous form also later drowned in the great ocean."
"Thereafter, employing an excellent speed and continuing on my course, I proceeded in 
that path speedily for a long time."
"Thereafter, I saw Surasa, the mother of serpents amid the sea. That goddess 
spoke the following words to me.
"O excellent of monkeys! The celestials have shown you as my eatable. Therefore, I will 
eat you since you have been bestowed to me by gods after a long time."
"Hearing Surasa's words, I stood there, offering salutation with my joined palms to her. 
Becoming pale-faced, I spoke the following words:
" 'Rama, the son of Dasaratha the splendid man and the tormentor of enemies, together 
with Lakshmana, his brother, and Seetha entered the forest of Dandaka.'"
" 'The evil-minded Ravana took away Seetha, Rama's wife. By the orders of Rama, I am 
going to her as an envoy.' "
"'You, abiding in Rama's country, ought to do a help to Rama. Otherwise, after seeing 
Seetha and Rama, who is unwearied in action, I will come to your mouth. I am thus promising you in truth."
Hearing my words, Surasa who can assume any form at her will said: "No one can violate 
me by unfaithfulness. I have this boon with me."
"Hearing the words of Surasa, I, as tall as ten Yojanas (eighty miles), within a moment, 
grew half as much in size (fifteen Yojanas or one hundred twenty miles)."
"She opened her mouth so wide as to correspond to the size of my body. Seeing her expanded 
mouth, I assumed a dwarfish form. At that moment, I still became reduced to the size of a human thumb."
"After entering her mouth quickly, I then came out instantly. The divine Surasa, in her 
native form, spoke to me again, as follows:
"'O gently monkey! O the foremost among monkeys! Go happily for the fulfillment of your 
purpose. Bring back Seetha to the magnanimous Rama. O mighty-armed monkey! Be happy. I am pleased with 
you.'"
"Then, all living beings praised me! Saying Good! Well done! Bravo! Thereupon, I leaped 
into the extensive sky, like Garuda the eagle, the carrier of Lord Vishnu."
"In the meanwhile, my shadow was held fast. Yet, I did not perceive anything. My speed 
having been blocked, I surveyed all the ten directions. But I could not discover there, any object by 
which my movement was blocked."
"Then, the thought arose in me: "How I wonder has such a hindrance arose in my journey, 
although no concrete configuration is being seen here?"
"While I was thinking thus, my sight has fallen downward. There, I saw a terrible female-demon 
lying in the water."
"Heartily laughing with a great noise, that terrific woman, spoke to me the following 
inauspicious words, firmly and without any bewilderment (as follows):
"O gigantic monkey! Where are you going? You are my requisite food, hungry as I am. Gratify 
my person, who has remained without sustenance for long."
"Saying 'Amen', I accepted those words. Thereupon, I expanded my body to a size 
larger than the capacity of her mouth."
"Her terrific large mouth too began to grow to devour me. She could not understand well 
about me or about the change subsequently gone through by me (in the shape of a minute form)"
"Then, having contracted my large body within another moment, I extracted her heart and 
leaped back into the sky."
"When her heart has been cut off by me, that terrific Simhika looking like a mountain, 
fell into the ocean with her arms emanating from it."
"I heard great sages along with wandering celestial singers, moving in the sky, saying 
that Simhika the dreadful demon was instantly killed by Hanuma."
"After killing her and again recollecting the task to be performed quickly, I traveled 
for a long distance and saw the southern shore of the ocean, where the City of Lanka, adorned with 
its trees were situated."
"While the sun was setting, I, without being noticed by the demons of dreadful prowess, 
entered the city of Lanka, the abode of demons."
"While I was entering the City, a woman, resembling a cloud at the time of dissolution 
of the world, stood up in front of me, emitting a loud laughter."
"Then defeating that woman, having her hair looking terrific like a blazing fire and 
who was trying to kill me, by striking her with a blow of the fist of my left hand and entered the land 
of Lanka at the dusk of early night. she, being frightened, spoke to me as follows:
"O hero! I am (the personified) City of Lanka. Therefore, by the same prowess you conquered 
me, you can defeat all the demons here completely."
"Searching there for Seetha that whole night in Ravana's gynaecium, I could not find 
Seetha, the slender-waisted lady."
"Unable to find Seetha in Ravana's dwelling and facing a sea of sorrow, I could not then 
perceive its other shore."
"While bemoaning, I saw an excellent grove near that gynaecium, concealed by a prolonged 
fence painted with golden color."
Crossing the fence, I saw that the grove had copious trees. Amidst that Ashoka garden, 
I saw a large Shimshupa* garden. After ascending it, I beheld a yellow-pigmented thicket of banana 
plants."
"Not far from that Shimshupa tree. I saw Seetha, of youthful complexion, with eyes looking 
like lotus-petals, with her face emaciated by fasting, clad in a single piece of cloth, her hair soiled 
with dust, her limbs afflicted with grief and agony, devoted as she was to the good of her lord and 
surrounded by ugly and cruel female-demons living on flesh and blood, as a doe encircled 
by tigresses."
"Seetha, who had eyes like those of a deer, was somehow quickly found by me looking depressed 
in the amidst of female-demons, frightened (as she was by them) again and again, putting on a single 
braid of hair (as a mark of desolation), wholly devoted to the thought of her lord, having floor as 
her bedstead, pale-limbed like a lotus-stalk in a cool season, turning away the request of Ravana, and 
determined to die."
"Seeing that illustrious woman, the consort of Rama in such a state, I stayed perched 
on the same Simsupa tree, looking at her."
"Meanwhile, I heard an exceedingly roaring and hallooing sound, mixed with sounds of 
girdles and anklets in the abode of Ravana."
"Then, I was very much frightened and contracted my physique. I, on my part, remained 
hidden like a bird in that Simsupa tree dense with foliage.'"
"Then, the mighty Ravana and his wives reached that place where Seetha was staying."
"Thereupon, seeing that Ravana the chief of a troop of demons, Seetha with her lovely 
waist, sat compressing her thighs enclosing her swollen breasts with her arms."
"Ravana, bowing his head and coming down, spoke (as follows) to that Seetha who was frightened, 
very much grieving for her lord, glancing hither and thither, not finding any protection for her, trembling, 
distressed and extremely sorrowful saying, 'Treat me with respect.'"
" 'O arrogant lady! O Seetha! If you refuse me by your arrogance, I will be drinking 
your blood after two months.'"
"Hearing those words of the evil-minded Ravana, Seetha was very much irritated and spoke 
the following excellent words:
"How did your tongue not fall off, O the worst demon, by speaking such words not to be 
uttered, to the consort of Rama, of boundless glory, and the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha the lord of 
Ikshvaku dynasty?"
"O ignoble soul! Of what account is your prowess, when you came unnoticed during the 
absence of my lord, that great soul and abducted me, O sinful one?"
" 'You have no similarity with Rama. You are unfit even to do service to Rama. Rama performs 
sacrifices. He speaks only the truth. He is a lover of battle'."
"Hearing these harsh words from Seetha, Ravana was at once ablaze with anger, as a fire 
blazes in a pile of wood."
" 'Rolling his cruel eyes and lifting his right fist, Ravana was about to kill Seetha. 
Then, an alarm was raised by women there'."
"Springing up from the midst of those women, a royal woman named Mandodari, the wife 
of that evil-minded Ravana, ran to him. He was restrained by her."
"She spoke to Ravana, smitten with love, the following sweet words: 'O Ravana having 
a prowess similar to that of Indra! Of what need is with Seetha to you?"
" 'O lord! Enjoy yourself with the daughters of gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, and Yakshas the semi-divine beings. What will you do with Seetha?'"
"Thereupon, those women together propitiated that mighty Ravana and quickly took him 
to his palace."
"When that Ravana left, the ugly-faced female-demons frightened. Seetha with their cruel 
and very dreadful words."
"Seetha reckoned the utterance of those women as a blade of grass. At that time, the 
roaring of those female-demons reached Seetha in vain."
"As their roaring frittered away, those flesh-eating female-demons became helpless and 
reported that great resolve of Seetha to Ravana."
"Thereafter, all those women joined together, warded off their hopes, and held back their 
effort. In the end, they encircled Seetha and were overpowered with sleep."
"When those women went to sleep, Seetha, intent upon the welfare of her husband, was 
deeply aggrieved, miserable, and sore depressed as she was, lamenting pitifully."
"Trijata, rising from the midst of those female-demons, spoke the following words; 'Feed 
on yourself quickly rather than on Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, a virtuous woman, and the daughter-in-law 
of Dasartha who des not get destroyed'."
"'Now, I have seen a dreadful dream, causing my hair to stand erect. It is pointing towards 
the ruin of our demons and the victory of her husband."
"  We will pray for Seetha, who is capable of protecting all our female-demons from Rama. 
I feel that it is batter for us'."
" 'When such a dream is seen while a woman is weeping, that woman gets relieved of many 
kinds of sorrows and will obtain happiness. Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, indeed will be pleased on 
receiving a salutation'."
"Delighted at hearing the victory of her lord, that girl Seetha then bashfully spoke: 
'If it is true, I will be protecting you all'."
"Taking rest for some time and seeing such a dreadful state of Seetha, I reflected upon 
it. My mind could not satisfy itself."
"Thinking about a means for starting a conversation with Seetha, I started to describe 
the history of Ikshvaku's dynasty."
"Hearing the words spoken by me, which are adored by the assemblies of royal sages, Seetha 
the princess, with her eyes filled with tears, spoke to me, as follows:"
" 'O the foremost among the monkeys! Who are you? Why did you come here? How did you 
come? What type of friendship do you have with Rama? You ought to tell me all this?"
"Hearing those words of Seetha, I spoke the following words: 'O princess! There is a 
courageous king of monkeys, by the name Sugreeva, who is a mighty companion to your husband, possessing 
a terrific prowess."
"Know me, who came here, as Hanuma, a servant of that Sugreeva, Rama, your husband, who 
is unwearied in his actions, sent me here for your sake."
"O illustrious lady! Rama, the foremost among men and the glorious man, gave this finger-ring 
personally to you as a token of remembrance."
"O princess! For that reason, I wish to have a command from you. What am I to do? I shall 
take you to the proximity of Rama and Lakshmana. What do you say?"
"Hearing my words and understanding them, Seetha the daughter of Janaka said as follows: 
'Let Rama take me back, after killing Ravana'."
"Bowing my head in salutation to the noble and irreproachable Seetha, I asked for a token 
of remembrance which would gladden the heart of Rama."
"Then, Seetha spoke to me as follows: 'Let this foremost jewel, be taken, by which the 
long-armed Rama will have a high opinion of you'."
"Speaking thus, Seetha having fine hips gave that wonderful and the foremost jewel. 
Highly distressed, she gave a message also in words to me."
"Then, offering salutation to Seetha the princess in utmost devotion, I circumambulated 
her from left to right, of course with my mind setting out to come here."
"Determining something in mind, she spoke to me again as follows: 'O Hanuma! You ought 
to tell Rama about my tale of woes occurring here'."
" 'Act so that both those heroes Rama and Lakshmana together with Sugreeva quickly arrive 
here, soon after hearing my tale'."
"'If proves to be otherwise, my survival will be only for two months. Rama cannot see 
me thereafter. As such, I will be dying like a helpless woman'."
"Hearing those miserable words, I became angry. Thereafter, I thought of my remaining 
successive action to be done."
"Thereafter, my body grew up to a size equal to that of a mountain. Then, I started destroying 
that garden, thereby longing for a combat."
"The female-demons; with their ugly faces woke up and saw that thicket of the garden being 
broken and with its frightened animals and birds moving about unsteadily."
"Coming from their respective places and seeing me in that garden, those female-demons 
quickly went and reported the matter to Ravana (as follows):"
"O mighty king! Indeed not knowing your prowess, an evil-minded monkey ahs demolished 
your inaccessible garden."
"O emperor! Give orders quickly to kill him, so that the evil-minded monkey, who 
caused offense to you, will get destroyed."
"Hearing those words, Ravana sent invincible demons called Kinkaras, who were adapted 
to the mind of Ravana."
"In that portion of the garden, I destroyed with an iron rod, eight thousand chinkaras, 
having darts and hammers in their hands."
"Taking quick steps, those few who have survived, went and reported the news to Ravana, 
of their large army having been killed by me."
"Then, an idea came to me. Occupying a lofty palatial mansion of a sanctuary which was 
an eminent ornament of Lanka. I killed again a hundred demons stationed there with a pillar."
"Then, Ravana dispatched Jambumali, the son of Prahasta together with numerous dreadful 
demons having terrific forms."
"I destroyed that demon, though endowed with great strength and skilled in warfare, 
along with his followers, with my terrific iron bar itself."
"Hearing of it, Ravana, the king of demons, dispatched the son of his minister, endowed 
with great strength and strengthened with a regiment of infantry."
"I killed all of them also by that iron bar itself. Hearing of the minster's sons, who 
were quick in exhibiting their valor in battle, having been killed, Ravana dispatched five valiant 
generals."
"I got all the minster's sons together with their army destroyed. Then, Ravana, the ten-headed 
monster, sent his mighty son, Aksha together with a multitude of army for the combat."
"I suddenly caught by the feet, that prince, son of Mandodari, who was skilled in warfare 
and who was jumping into the sky with his sword and shield. I whirled him round a hundred times and 
crushed him."
"Hearing of the death of Aksha in combat, that ten-headed Ravana was very much enraged 
and thereupon dispatched his second son, by name Indrajit, who was strong but foolishly arrogant in 
battle."
"By conquering all that army in battle and making that Indrajit the foremost among demons; 
lusterless, I experienced a great joy."
"Ravana himself dispatched, with a great confidence, that long-armed and mighty Indrajit 
along with valiant demons excited with their arrogance."
"Knowing me to be irresistible and his army being perishable, that Indrajit with 
great haste captured me with a Brahma-missile."
"Then, the demons, after capturing me, tied me there with ropes and carried me away to 
Ravana's presence."
"Seeing me, the evil-minded Ravana spoke to me. He asked, why did you come to Lanka? 
'Why did you kill the demons?'"
"I answered 'I have done all these acts for the sake of Seetha. O king of demons! I came 
to your abode with a desire to see Seetha. I am the offspring of a wind-god and a monkey by the name Hanuma'."
" 'Know me to be a monkey, an envoy of Rama, and a minister of Sugreeva. As Rama's messenger, 
I sought your presence here!"
"  That Sugreeva of great splendor enquired about your welfare. He told you (the following) 
beneficiary words, endowed with righteousness wealth, and pleasure, appropriate for you'."
" 'While I was dwelling in Mount R^ishyamuka, abounding with numerous trees, Rama having 
a great prowess in battle became a friend to me'."
" 'The king Rama told me that his wife had been taken away by a demon and that I had 
to help him in that matter by all means."
" 'I also told him about the killing of Vali and requested him to come to a mutual agreement 
for helping me in that matters'."
" 'Rama, the great lord along with Lakshmana made friendship with Sugreeva, (whose kingdom 
was taken away by Vali) taking Agni the fire-god for a witness.'
" 'Killing Vali by a single arrow in combat, Rama made Sugreeva (lord of monkeys) an 
emperor of monkeys."
" 'Now we have to extend help to that Rama in all ways. Therefore, I am sending Hanuma 
rightly to your presence'."
" 'Even before the heroic monkeys destroy your army, bring Seetha quickly and give her 
back to Rama'."
" 'To whom is this strength of the monkeys not already known, who go even to the presence 
of gods, when invited by them for help?'"
" 'Sugreeva the king of monkeys has sent the foregoing message to you. 'When spoken by 
me in these words, Ravana was enraged and looked at me, as though he was going to reduce me to ashes 
with his very looks."
"Without knowing my glory ( in the form of my immunity to death), the evil-minded Ravana, 
the demon doing terrific acts, ordered for my killing."
"Then, there is the brother of that Ravana, called Vibhishana having great intelligence. 
He entreated Ravana, the king of demons, on my behalf (as follows)"
"O Ravana the foremost among the demons! No such attempt should be made in this way. 
Let this design be abandoned forthwith. You are indeed following a path which is contrary to the statesmanship."
"O Ravana! It is not indeed found in states' policies of killing an envoy. The real truth 
is to be known from an envoy speaking a good counsel."
"O Ravana of great prowess! Even if a very high offense is committed by an envoy, an 
act of disfiguring the person is mentioned in a treatise of state-policy and not of killing."
"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana ordered those demons to burn my tail by fire."
"Thereupon, hearing Ravana's words; the demons wrapped up my entire tail with bark of 
hemp and torn cotton-clothes."
"Thereafter, the demons of terrible prowess, who completed their arrangements, striking 
me with their wooden staffs and fists, burnt my tail. Even though I was bound with many ropes, I maintained 
restraint."
"Then, having reached the city-gate, those strong demons made a loud proclamation of 
my presence in the principal streets, bound and enveloped in flames as I was."
"Then, after contracting my gigantic form once more and releasing my bondage, I stood 
in my native form again. Seizing an iron bar, I killed those demons."
"Then, I quickly jumped on to that city-gate and without any bewilderment, I set fire 
that city with its attics, ramparts, and gates with my tail inflamed, even as a fire at the end of the 
the world burns all living creatures."
"The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore 
Seetha also must have been surely burnt."
"Thus filled with grief, I came about to reflect as above. Meanwhile, I heard the auspiciously 
the worded utterance of charades the celestial signers who were narrating a tale of astonishment saying 
that Seetha has not been burnt."
"After hearing those surprising words, a thought arose in me that Seetha escaped being 
burnt. This is indicated by the following good omens:
"In the first place, even though my tail is burning, the fire is not burning my body. 
My heart too is delighted. The winds are sweet-smelling."
"My heart was delighted by seeing those good omens having their fruits apparent, by looking 
into their fruits apparent, by looking into the reasons of high characteristics, and by hearing the 
words of accomplished sages."
"Seeing Seetha once more, relieved by her again, and then reaching Mount Arishta there 
again, I started leaping back (over the sea) with a longing to see you (all)."
"Then, treading upon the path of the sky, frequented by the wind, the moon, the sun, 
Siddhas the semi-divine beings and Gandharvas the celestial musicians, I saw you all here."
"I performed all tasks for accomplishing the purpose of Sugreeva, by the grace of Rama 
and also through your energy."
"I have done all this properly there. Do accomplish that which remains undone in this 
task by me and complete it."Hearing those words of Hanuma, Angada the son of Vali spoke as follows: "Even after our 
seeing Seetha, it is not proper for us to approach the high-souled Rama without taking Seetha with 
us."
"I perceive it as improper to inform there that Seetha the princess, though seen by you 
of renowned prowess, has not been brought here."
"O the best of monkeys! No one is equal to us even in our prowess nor indeed anyone who 
can leap like us in the worlds either of celestials or demons."
"Hanuma indeed thus killed all the warriors among the demons. What work is remaining 
to be done by us? We will go, after taking Janaki."
Jambavan, the foremost among the forest animals, understanding the sense, was very much 
pleased and spoke the following meaningful words to that Angada, who thus formed a resolution.
"O prince! This thought you thus perceive is not incompetent of us. But, you must see 
how Rama's inclination would be, for the accomplishment of the object."Those envoys who are clearly ordered by Janaka entered the city of Ayodhya on sojourning 
for three nights en route, and whose horses are overtired for they are galloped 
so fast to loose no time. 
On going to the palace those envoys are given an audience with the consent of Dasharatha, 
and when they are conducted into the palace-chambers they have seen the elderly 
king Dasharatha gleaming like a god. 
Completely gone is the angst of all the legates on seeing godly Dasharatha, and 
all of them adjoing palms in reverence said this compliant and mellowly worded sentence 
to the king. 
Oh, exalted emperor Dasharatha! Janaka, the lineal king of Janaka-s and the present 
sovereign of Mithila is asking time and time again with mellowly words instilled 
with friendliness, after the wellbeing and after the unmitigated prosperity of your 
highness, along with that of your highness' priests and teachers, also that of your 
highness' subjects, who always precede your highness in convoys in any event, as 
your highness are the one who ingratiates himself with the Ritual-fires, ever and 
anon... 
His highness Janaka of Videha, and the sovereign of Mithila, having asked after 
your highness' wellbeing is sensibly saying this word to your highness, with the 
indorse of Kaushika... 
Well-known is the solemn promise of mine that my daughter Seetha is a bounty 
for bravery... also well-know is that the kings who came to lift the bow turned 
out as gutless kings, and then they turned out as rancorous kings at me, and it 
is also well-known that I turned them back with my guts... 
Oh, Emperor Dasharatha, your young and valorous son who serendipitously arrived 
at Mithila along with his younger brother Lakshmana, keeping Vishvamitra at his 
fore, finally carries off this girl, the well-known daughter of mine... 
Also, oh, highly dextrous king Dasharatha, noble souled Rama wrecked that divine 
bow, which is a gem of a bow among bows, at its central point before a grand assembly 
of people... 
Seetha is the bounty for bravery and I shall have to afford her to the noble-souled 
Rama, as such it will be apt of you to give your consent as I wish to keep up my 
solemn promise... 
Keeping your royal priest Vashishta and other teachers ahead of you, oh, great 
emperor, I wish you to come apace, let safe betide you, for it will be apt of you 
to take a look at your ennobled son Rama, and Lakshmana, too... 
'It will be apt of you to make my solemn promise maintainable, and that way you 
will derive delight on seeing both of your sons...' 
"Thus the sovereign of Videha kingdom said these endearing words, abiding by the 
counsel of Sage Shataananda, and Sage Vishvamitra is also consentient to the proposal..." 
Thus the envoys conveyed the proposal and paused. 
King Dasharatha is highly gladdened on hearing that message from the delegates, 
and said this way to Vashishta, Vaamadeva, and to his other ministers, as well. 

This one Rama, the enhancer of Kausalya's rejoice, is stopping over at Videha kingdom 
along with his brother Lakshmana, and Vishvamitra is taking care of both these boys... 

On observing the valour of Kakutstha Rama, noble souled Janaka wishes to gift his 
daughter as bride to Raghava Rama... 
"If you all favour the tidings from the noble-souled Janaka as to what has happened 
in Mithila, we quickly proceed to that city, let not the time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha 
informed his counsel. 
The ministers along with all of the great sages said in consonance, "Most Welcome..." 
and then that highly pleased king Dasharatha said to the ministers, "we travel tomorrow..." 

The ministers of king Janaka who are gifted with all talents are given grateful 
hospitality by Dasharatha, and they all dwelt that night in Ayodhya, overjoyed at 
the successful completion of their august legatine, calledsIta kalyANam...When sage Vashishta said that way, Janaka reverentially made palm fold and said this in reply, "oh, sage, let safeness betide 
you all... now, it will be apt of you all to listen to our distinguished lineage..." 
"Oh, eminent sage Vashishta, he who is born in a particular noble gens has to inform about his parentage in its entirety, 
especially when he offers a bride... thereby oh, great sage, let all be informed of about our lineage..." 
Once there was an emperor Nimi, who was renowned in the triad of worlds by his own accomplishments, and who was uniquely 
seraphic-souled and a best one among all stalwart emperors... 
And his son was named as Mithi, and Janaka was Mithi's son... the first one to be designated as Janaka... and even from 
that Janaka it is Udaavasu who took birth... 
From Udaavasu it is noble souled Nandivardhana took birth, and Nandivardhana's son is named as Suketu, by his name... 
From Suketu the highly powerful and virtue-souled Devaraata is born, and from that kingly sage Devaraata, it is Brihadratha 
who took birth, thus we have heard... 
From Brihadratha it is the highly braving, courageous and valiant Mahaaviira has come, and the bold and truth-valiant Sudhriti 
from Mahaaviira... 
Form Sudhriti, the right-minded and highly generous Dhristaketu took birth, and from the kingly sage Dhristaketu it is 
highly renowned Haryashva is the son... 
Haryashva's son is Maru, and Maru's, son is Pratiindhaka, and the son of Pratiindhaka's is noble-souled king Kiirtiratha... 

The son of Kiirtiratha is remembered as Devamiidha, and the son of Devamiidha is Vibudha, and Vibudha's son is Mahiidraka... 

Mahiidraka's son is the great mighty king Kiirtiraata, and the son born to sagely king Kiirtiraata is Mahaaroma... 
From Mahaaroma it is the virtue-souled Swarnaroma, and from kingly sage Swarnaroma it is Hrasvaroma... 
Two sons are born to that knower of virtue and noble souled Hrasvaroma, I am the elder, and my younger brother is this 
brave Kushadhvaja... 
He that king and father of ours, Hrasvaroma, anointing me in kingdom as I am the elder, and vesting the duty of looking 
after Kushadhvaja in me, he departed to forests... 
On the departure of our aged father to heaven, I am looking after this godlike Kushadhvaja with brotherliness and lugging 
around the burden of this kingship... 
Then after sometime, a valorous king named Sudhanva came beleaguering Mithila, from his city Saamkaasha... 
'The unexcelled bow of Shiva shall be given to me, along with the lotus-eyed virgin, Seetha...' thus he started to urge 
me... 
"Oh, Brahma sage Vashishta, for the reason of my non-bestowal of bow or bride he warred with me, and when he affronted me 
in that war I have put that Sudhanva to the sword..." 
Oh, best sage Vashishta, on eliminating king Sudhanva, I have anointed my valiant brother Kushadhvaja in the kingdom of 
Saamkaasha... 
Oh, best saint Vashishta, this is that younger brother of mine, and I am the elder. Oh, eminent-saint, I am bestowing those 
brides with a highly gladdened heart... Seetha for Rama, and Urmila for Lakshmana, let there be felicity for all... 
My daughter Seetha is the bounty for bravery and in simile she is the daughter of the divine Providence, and thus the second 
one Urmila too... oh, eminent-saint, with a highly gladdened heart I reiterate thrice while I bestow those brides, there 
is no doubt about it... 
Oh, king Dasharatha, let the preceding ritual ofsamaavartana, be undertaken, and let manes 
be propitiated by the ritual,naandi-shraadha, and afterwards you make happen the wedding celebrations 
... thus, all will be blest... 
Oh, great dextrous Dasharatha, the star ruling today ismagha, isn't it... oh, lord, on the 
third from now, say day after tomorrow, when the starphaalguNicomes, in its later part, namelyuttara-phalugNi, you may make happen this wedding, and the bounties likego-bhuu-tila-hiraNyaadii.e., ' cows, lands, grains, gold etc., that ensue the wellbeing 
of Rama and Lakshmana, may be accorded to the eligible generously... Rama on seeing that eagle felled to ground by the atrocious Ravana, said this sentence to Soumitri who 
is an asset for good companionability. 
"While this bird is venturing in my concern the demon felled him in combat and he is leaving off his 
lives owing to me, definitely... 
"Obviously, lives in his body are very feeble, oh, Lakshmana, it is natural, isn't it, and he looks 
highly anguished with a dulled voice..." Thus on saying to Lakshmana, Rama then spoke to Jataayu. 
"Oh, Jataayu, if you are in fine fettle to further reiterate words, relate about Seetha, let safe betide 
you, and recount how you are murdered, too... 
"What is the reason for Ravana in stealing that noblewoman, and even what is the wrong I have committed 
in his respect, keeping which in view that Ravana stole my ladylove... 
"How was that moon similar heart-stealing face of hers at that time of abduction, oh, best bird, and 
even what are the words she uttered when being abducted... 
"What is his stamina of that demon? What is his form? And what are his strategies? And where is his 
stronghold? Oh, sire, tell me while I ask you inquisitively..." Rama urged Jataayu thus for information. 

Then that warm-hearted Jataayu with his eyes rolling upwards saw Rama and with a fluttery voice said 
this sentence to Rama who is wailing like an orphan. 
"Resorting to his illusionistic devices like creating an immense and tumultuous windstorm and cloud-cover, 
the flagitious chief of demons Ravana abducted Seetha... 
"That night walker hacked both my wings when I was overtired, and went southward taking the princess 
of Videha, Seetha, along with him... 
"My sight is spinning and my lives are stifled, oh, Raghava, I am now seeing golden trees with cuscus 
grass as their treetops... 
"In which spell of time Ravana has gone taking away Seetha, that spell is named as Vinda... if any riches 
are lost during that spell, the original possessor of those riches will repossess them very quickly... 
oh, Kakutstha, he that Ravana is unmindful of that fact and stole Seetha only to loose her... 
"On stealing your ladylove Janaki, that chief of demons, Ravana, will ruin himself, as with a fish which 
swallows a baited fishhook... 
"Impractical is your anguishing for the daughter of Janaka, as you will delight yourself with Vaidehi 
in no time, on killing that Ravana in the vanguard of a war..." Thus saying Jataayu paused for a while. 

Though Jataayu is speaking on to Rama with an alert mind, blood freely flowed from his mouth with shreds 
of flesh as death verged on him, even then he struggled to say. 
"That demon is the son of Vishravasa... literally... the brother of Kubera..." on saying thus, that 
lord of birds released his lives, which are unobtainable for oneself. 
But the lives of Jataayu departing from his body went into thin air before the very eyes of Rama who 
is still speaking to him with folded-palms, "tell... tell more..." 
Jataayu flopped his head on earth, sprawled his feet on ground, and then his body collapsed onto the 
surface of earth writhing jerkily. 
He who is worsened by very many mishaps that Rama, on seeing the mountainous eagle whose eyes are bloodshot 
and whose lives have gone, said this way to Soumitri... 
"This bird which for years together lived fearlessly in Dandaka forest, a habitat of demons, that bird 
wilted to death, because of me... 
"He who has longevity over many years, who actively strived for a long for rectitude, he is now killed 
and prostrating before the Time, because of me... alas... it is indeed impossible to infringe the Time... 

"Lakshmana, this eagle which has dashed to rescue Seetha in order to render help to me is slain by that 
brute-forced Ravana, only because of me, you see... 
"On abandoning great empire of eagles belonging to his father and forefathers this lord of bird has 
now abandoned his lives too, only for my sake... 
"Universally noticeable are the protective, prepotent, principled ones that are the followers of probity, 
oh, Soumitri, even though their births are avian or bestial... 
"To me, oh, enemy-inflamer, oh, gentle Lakshmana, anguish caused by Seetha's abduction is not that much, 
when compared with the anguish caused by the perish of this eagle, that too, because of me... 
"As to how the celebrated and highly renowned king Dasharatha is venerable and honourable for me, likewise 
this lord of birds is also a venerable and honourable one to me... 
"Oh, Soumitri, get the firewood and I will produce fire by friction of two sticks, as I wish to cremate 
this lord of birds who expired because of me... 
"Oh, Soumitri, I will mount this lord of realm of birds onto the pyre and cremate him who is killed 
by a feral demon..." Thus saying to Lakshmana, Rama said this to dead eagle Jataayu. 
"Oh, greatly mighty king of eagles, by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to, you depart 
to the unexcelled heavenly worlds... you depart to those worlds that are destined for the virtuosos 
of Vedic-rituals, and to those worlds that are destined for the practisers of ascesis amid Five-Ritual-fires, 
and to those that are destined for un-retreating combatants, and to those worlds that destined for the 
donors of lands..." So said Rama to the departed Jataayu. 
On saying that way, that ethical-souled Rama mounted that lord of birds onto the pyre and he sorrowfully 
incinerated that eagle in a flaring fire of pyre, as he would do in respect of his own deceased relative. 

Then that resolute Rama on going into forest along with Soumitri hunted a robust-bodied, big Rohi animal, 
or, Kesari animal, and then he spread sacred grass on ground to place that offering to the deceased 
soul of that bird. 
On drawing up the flesh of that Rohi animal and lumping it to gobbets, that highly observant Rama placed 
those gobbets on pleasant greenish pasturelands as obsequial offerings in respect of that bird Jataayu. 

Rama immediately chanted Vedic hymns that are employed in such funerals of one's own paternal people, 
as Brahmans say that those hymns are employable in such rites as they lead the soul of the departed 
to heaven. 
Then both the sons of that notable man, namely Dasharatha, on going to River Godavari they have oblated 
waters for that king of eagles, Jataayu. 
Both of the Raghava-s took funeral baths in the waters of River Godavari and then made water oblations 
to the king of eagles. 
That king of eagle Jataayu, who has performed a creditworthy deed of stalling and combating Ravana, 
but who is felled by that Ravana, went away to the merited and auspicious heavenly realms of his own, 
as and when consecrated by sublime sage like Rama. 
Even those two, Rama and Lakshmana, on performing water oblations in respect of that best bird Jataayu, 
and on assertively giving thought to the information given by Jataayu, they like the chiefs of gods, 
namely Vishnu and Indra, went to southerly woods when their mind is set to search for Seetha. Jataayu who is slumbering away craned and stared on hearing the voicing of Seetha and then he saw Ravana 
and even Vaidehi. 
That best bird majestic Jataayu with a very sharp beak and appearing like a mountain peak, then uttered 
these words of expediency still perching on a tree. 
"Oh, brother, now it is inapt of you to undertake a deplorable deed. I am one of those who abide by 
perpetual probity and avowed to truthfulness. Such as I am, oh, Decahedral-demon Ravana, I am the mightiest 
king of eagles known by the name Jataayu. 
"Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is the master of all the world, one similar to Mahendra and Varuna, the 
Rain-god, and the one who is connected with the well-being of all the world. 
"Whom you desire to abduct now, that best lady is Seetha by her name, and this glorious one is the legitimate 
wife of that preserver of all the worlds, namely Rama. 
"How a king adhering to probity can lay his hands on the wives of others? If it is a king's wife, oh, 
great-mighty Ravana, she is to be safeguarded particularly. 
"Reverse your filthy course, or fortuity, or mind form laying your hands on other's wives. A sagacious 
person does not undertake that deed by which others deplore him. As with the protection of one's own 
wife from somebody's laying hands on her, other person's wife is also to be protected in that way. 
"If the means to gain probity, or prosperities, or even pleasures are inconspicuous in scriptures, oh, 
the scion of Paulastya, then even the erudite scholars will conduct themselves following the king and 
his demeanour. 
"A king is the best repository for probity, prosperities, and pleasures, and whether it is probity or 
felicity or even iniquity that will emerge from the fount called king. 
"Oh, prominent one among demons, deviltry and mercuriality are but natural for you demons, but how you 
have amassed affluence, as with an evildoer attaining an aircraft that puts him to flight to heaven.
"You by your nature are a devilish and mercurial personality though you have come from a decent lineage, 
how you have become an outranking demon among demons and how you could attain kingdom, which is to be 
ruled righteously, like an evildoer attaining a heaven-bound aircraft. 
"He whose nature is such, that nature is perhaps impossible to efface, a sermon does not dwell in the 
heart of an evil-minded one for a long time, indeed.
"He whose nature itself is vile, it is perhaps impossible for him to efface it, and in the residence 
of such an evil-minded person, evilly acquired prosperity does not dwell for a long time, indeed. 
"When that great-mighty Rama has not transgressed either in your country or in your city Lanka, then 
how you become a transgressor in respect of that noble-souled Rama? 
"If Rama of indefatigable deeds firstly eliminated Khara who is stationed at Janasthaana, and who transgressed 
for the sake of Shuurpanakha, tell me what in actuality is the highly overstepping behaviour of Rama 
in that matter, whereupon you are stealing off with the wife of such a lord of world? 
"Instantly deliver up Vaidehi. Let not the disastrous and glowing fire-like eyes of Rama, which transmogrify 
so when he assumes fury, burn you down as the Thunderbolt of Indra once burnt the demon Vritta. 
"You are unconscious that you have presently bundled a lethally venomous serpent at the fringe of your 
attire, and you are equally unwary that the Terminator's lasso is presently loosened around your neck. 

"Oh, cultured one, that weight alone is to be shouldered by which a man is not brought down, and that 
repast alone is to be consumed by which nothing upsets. 
"Who will undertake a deed that yields neither probity, nor deference, nor distinction but results in 
just physical drudgery? 
"I have dedicated myself to the kingdom of my fathers and forefathers according to tradition, and sixty 
thousand years have elapsed since I was born. 
"You are youngish whereas I am oldish, you are an armoured archer darting arrows from an air-chariot, 
whereas I am pensile bird in an open sky. Nevertheless, on taking Vaidehi you cannot abscond safely. 

"It will be incapable of you to forcibly abduct Vaidehi when I keep an eye one her, as with the defilement 
of definitive Vedic scriptures by the logicians, dialecticians, materialists and suchlike non-believers, 
with their conjectural logic.
"Veda-s are definitive in their canons and their authority is established beyond doubt, yet the doubtful 
scholarly logicians still try to pamper their import with their conjectural logic, and when I am watchful 
of what is going on I do not let you pamper Seetha, as such take this caution and release her. 
"Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right 
away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. 

"He who eliminated demons and ogres in combats time after time, that Rama though apparently attired 
in jute-cloths like a meek-saint, will become a towering-inferno in a given combat, and he eliminates 
you very soon. 
"What can possibly be done by me when those princes have gone far-off! It is beyond the scope of my 
fetching them in time! You knave, you who are scared of them will now be lost to my blockade, without 
a doubt. 
"When I am alive you cannot lead away this auspicious, lotus-leave-eyed Seetha, the dear queen of Rama. 

"But I must definitely accomplish something to forestall you till they come, for I cannot willingly 
depart from here to fetch any of the two brothers, and that deed I needs must do shall be agreeable 
to the great-souled Rama, likewise even to Dasharatha, even at the stake of my life. 
"Stopoff! Stopoff! Oh, Decahedral Ravana, briefly learn of me as how I jettison you from your best air-chariot, 
as with the unloading of a burdensome fruit from its sepals. Oh, nightwalker, I will be giving guestship 
to you in a duel as long as I am alive. In this chapter Valmiki narrates various rituals undertaken by Rama the crown prince, along with his wife Seetha, on the eve of his anointment ceremony. The festivities in Ayodhya, the happiness of the people with King Dasaratha's decision to anoint Rama are also described here. Also, people from different directions arrive in Ayodhya to be there on the grand occasion.
After Vasistha left, Rama took bath and meditated on Lord Narayana with undistracted mind along with his wide-eyed wife, Seetha.
Taking the vessel with clarified butter on his head as per scriptures, he offered to Lord Vishnu the clarified butter, by dropping it into the blazing fire.
Rama ate the remainder of clarified butter after finishing the sacrifice, which he performed for his own good, silently meditated on Lord Narayana with controlled mind and slept along with Seetha on a properly laid bed of Kusa grass in a splendid temple of Lord Vishnu. *
Rama woke up three hours before dawn and caused to complete the entire decoration of the house.
Listening to the pleasing verses of professional reciters, he worshipped the early sunrise and meditated on Gayatri* with an undistracted mind.
He praised Lord Vishnu by bowing his head before Him. By wearing pure silk clothes, he got valedictory text recited by Brahmans.
Their deep and sweet chorus of the valedictory, united with the accompanying musical instruments, then filled the city of Ayodhya.
All the people residing in Ayodhya were delighted when they heard that Rama and
Seetha had observed fast for the ensuing anointment ceremony.
All the citizens decorated the town for coronation function of Rama, soon before
sunrise.
Banners and colorful flags were hoisted on temples, which looked brilliantly like
the silver lining of cloud, at road junctions, in streets, on big trees situated in temple compounds, from watching towers at city gates, on shops of wealthy merchants, on buildings of rich family persons, on all assembly halls and all visible trees.
From different sides, actors were showing their talents, dancers were performing
dance. Singers were singing and sweet voices were heard, pleasing the minds and ears.
With Rama's anointment ceremony approaching, people were engaged in mutual
conversations in their houses and at road junctions, about the ceremony.
Even children playing together before gateways of houses were telling each other,
narratives of Rama's anointment ceremony.
The citizens made king's road splendid, by sprinkling flowers on it and by making it good smelling with burning of incense and perfumes, on the occasion of Rama's anointment ceremony.
On a doubt of approach of night on completion of the ceremony, they arranged lamps in the shape of trees to illuminate all the streets.
All the citizens residing in Ayodhya, having thus decorated the city desiring Rama's coronation, gathered together in groups at road junctions and in assembly halls, mutually talking about this matter there and praising king Dasaratha.
"O! This king Dasaratha, who delights Ikshvaaku dynasty, having known himself that he became aged, is going to anoint Rama for the kingdom. What a great man he is!" 
"Rama; who has seen the totality of the world is going to become our protector for long. We have all been blessed by king Dasaratha."
"Rama is modest, knowledgeable and righteous. He is as compassionate to us as to his brothers."
"Let the faultless and righteous king Dasaratha live long! Due to his blessings, we are going to see Rama as being anointed for the kingdom."
The villagers, who came from different directions after hearing the news of
coronation ceremony of Rama, listened to the narration of the citizens of Ayodhya.
The city of Ayodhya was filled with villagers who came from different directions to see the anointment ceremony of Rama.
The noise in the city was heard by the groups of those people, while moving here and there, as the roaring of an impetuous ocean on full moon days.
That city of Ayodhya equal to the residence of the celestial god Indra, disturbed
with the sound being made all over by the villagers who came with the desire to see the ceremony, shone like a roaring ocean filled with sea animals.That Sumantra, who knew the ancient sacred works, passed over the crowded entrance of the palace and reached the secluded inner apartment. In that area of the inner apartment, some youths , wearing darts and bows, were on security-duty with due vigilance and attention. They were all greatly devoted to the king and were wearing polished ear-rings.
There he saw aged palace-supervisors wearing orange coloured clothes, adorning
themselves well, having canes in their hands, well composed and being posted at door-ways.
All of them, the well-wishers of Rama, saw that Sumantra arriving and raised from
their seats hurriedly at once.
That humble-minded Sumantra spoke to them thus, "Tell Rama immediately that Sumantra is waiting with reverence at the entrance" They, the well-wishers of their master, approached Rama who was with his wife and immediately informed him.
Knowing that Sumantra, who was intimate to his father, came, Rama who desired to
show kindness, called him in there.
That Sumantra saw Rama sitting like Kubera on a golden couch with the best
cloth-covering. He adorned himself well and had the body anointed with sandal perfume, purely smelling like blood of a boar. With Sita, standing on his side with chowrie in her hand, Rama was shining like moon with chitra star.
Sumantra, who knew polite conduct, offered salutation to Rama, who was refined with his own brilliance, shining like the sun and the fulfiller of desires.
Sumantra, who was treated with respect by Rama spoke thus with folded hands to that prince with beautiful face and who was seated on a swinging sofa.
"Oh Rama, the good offspring of Kausalya! Your father and the Queen Kaikeyi want to see you. Go there soon."
That best of men with great brilliance was pleased to hear those words, then
honoured him and spoke thus to Sita.
"Oh Sita! The king and the queen together are thinking of something about me,
relating to coronation. It is certain."
"Then black-eyed Kaikeyi who is dexterous and friendly disposed, has perceived the king's opinion and is inciting him for my sake"
"Kaikeyi, my mother is following the king's intentions with great pleasure, desirous of my benefit and prosperity"
"It is certainly our luck that king and queen have sent Sumantra, who fulfils my
desires and wishes, as messenger".
"A worthy messenger has come who is truly representing the assembly there. It is
certain that today itself the king will anoint me for the right of succession to kingdom".
"I shall go immediately and see the king. You stay happily with the circle of
friends and enjoy yourself."
Sita, treated with respect by her husband and having black eyes, followed her
husband up to the door, thinking of auspicious things in her mind.
"King Dasaratha will give you kingdom, being served by brahmanas, which will invest you with eligibility to perform the great sacrifice at the coronation ceremony like Brahma to Devendra."
"I shall be delighted to see you, initiated for the perfect religious act of
austerity, wearing excellent antelope-hide, being pure and bearing a deer-horn in hand".
"May Indra the god of rain in the east, Yama the god of death in the south, Varuna the regent of the ocean in the west and Kubera the god of riches and treasure in the north, protect you".
Rama, adorned as in an auspicious festivity, took permission from Sita and started from house along with Sumantra.
That Rama who came out, like a lion residing in a mountain cave from out of the
mountain, saw Lakshmana standing at the door, bowing with palms of the hand joined and put to the forehead as a mark of respect.
Then, that prince the best of men, met his friends in the middle chamber. He saw all the people who came there to behold him, approached nearer to them, greeted them and mounted the excellent chariot, which was resplendent like fire and covered with tiger's skin.
That chariot was sounding like thunder. It was not congested. It was decorated with gold and jewels. Its splendour was like that of Meru mountain, stealing the eyes. Excellent horses looking like infantine elephants were tied to the chariot, which was moving quickly. That Rama shining with splendour like Indra, the lord of sky, mounted such a chariot and went forth quickly.
That splendid chariot, sounding like rain-cloud in the sky, came out of the house
like moon coming out of a mighty cloud.
Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother mounted the chariot in the back-side and protected Rama with umbrella and chamara fan.
Then, the crowds started dispersing from all sides generating tumultuous hallowing sound.
Thereupon, hundreds and thousands of important people mounted on excellent horses
and soldiers mounted on elephants, then followed Rama.
Valiant persons, dressed in armour adorned with sandal and aloe perfumes, wearing
swords and bows, declaring the arrival of Rama, went in front of Rama to receive him.
At that time, sounds of musical instruments, sounds of praising hymns of panagyrists and lion-like roars of valiant persons were heard on the way.
While Rama, the annihilator of enemies, was going, well-adorned women standing in
porticoes of palaces, sprinkled flowers on him from all sides.
Women of exquisitely beautiful form standing in palaces and on ground were offering salutations to Rama with the best words with a desire to please Rama.
"Oh, Rama, who creates happiness to mother! Have successful journey! Your mother
Kausalya will be certainly delighted to see you obtaining the paternal kingdom."
Those women thought that Sita, who is dear to Rama's heart, is better woman than all women.
"As Rohini star stays together with the moon, Sita having obtained Rama as husband must have certainly performed a great penance in former times."
While going through the royal road, Rama heard those pleasant words spoken thus by women standing in turrets.
Then, Rama heard the words of people gathered there and also the words variously
pertaining to himself, by citizens.
"By the king's propitiousness, this Rama today is going to obtain this earth and the wealthy kingdom. All our desires are going to be fulfilled because Rama will become the ruler."
"If Rama rules this state for a long time, it will be a great benefit to the people.
If he becomes a king none can see dislike and sorrow at any time."
While bards and panegyrists were moving in front praising with great respect,
invoking blessings and eulogised by the most excellent instrumentalists, Rama, like Kubera the god of wealth, went with resounding horses and elephants.
Rama saw the great royal road which was spotlessly clean, having diamonds and
various vendible commodities. It was full of male and female elephants, horses and chariots. There was abundance of people gathered at road junctions.When Kabandha said that way, both those brave men and lords of people, on throwing the body of Kabandha 
into a mountain cleft and then embedded it with firewood. 
On his part Lakshmana started to torch that pyre with highly sparkling torches from all over, and even 
that pyre too suddenly blazed with blazes from all over. 
That massy body of Kabandha is full with fat and while it is being cooked, it is in simile with a massy 
gob of ghee. But the Fire had to stew that body tardily, though that stewed meat is Fire's favourite 
dish, because of that body's massiveness. 
In a trice that highly dynamic Kabandha zoomed up shoving off that pyre, and he is now attired in lily-white 
vestments and angelic garlands, and appeared like a fumeless fire. 
Then highly gladdened Kabandha jumped up onto sky from the pyre, and there he is irradiant with unsullied 
clothing, and fineries decorated on every limb. 
On going to firmament Kabandha is now seated in a dazzling celestial aircraft yoked with swans, which 
endows renown because it takes the occupants to the realms of Brahma, and sitting in that celestial 
aircraft he said this sentence to Rama, while his own great glimmer and glitter beamed forth in all 
ten quarters. 
"Oh, Raghava, how you will regain Seetha, that you listen from me in its essence... oh, Rama, by which 
and which analyses everything will be analysed, six of such ideations are available in this world... 
and when a person is touched down by a spell of nemeses, he shall adore one who is equally in such spell 
of nemesis... 
"Oh, Rama, you along with Lakshmana went into a spell of nemesis, and thus you have become an underprivileged 
one, and that spell alone has obtained you this dire straits, in the form of abducting your wife... 

"Oh, best among kind-hearted ones, thereby you have to certainly befriend such a soul in similar dire 
straits... however deeply I may think, I am not able to perceive your accomplishment if you do not befriended 
with such a soul... 
"Oh, Rama, listen what I tell... a vanara is there by name Sugreeva, who is vengefully reneged by his 
brother Vali, the son of Indra... 
"That self-respectful valiant Sugreeva is living on the Mt. Rishyamuka, a best mountain available in 
the lambent fringes of Pampa Lake, along with four other vanara-s. 
"He that Sugreeva is a masterful one among vanara-s, highly mettlesome, self-resplendent, and illimitable 
is his self-radiance... and he is also truth-bound and culture-bound... a mastermind, master-hand and 
a taskmaster... 
"He is a capable adventurer, a courageous exploiter and incomparable one in intrepidity and a brave 
one in incursions, and his personality will be coruscating ever and anon, for he is the son of Sun-god... 
but he is banished by his self-conceited brother owing to the reasons of kingdom... 
"Oh, Rama, he will be your associate and an aid in searching for Seetha, and he conducts himself in 
your wellbeing, hence let not your heart yield to agony... 
"Oh, tigerly Ikshvaaku, further nothing can be countermanded in this world which is indeed ineluctable, 
and it is impossible to countervail against Time, isn't it... 
"Oh, bold one, you go straight from here to that great mighty Sugreeva, and oh, Raghava, on going from 
here now and promptly you fraternise with Sugreeva... and to not to bode any ill of unfriendliness among 
you two, you make him a friend before blazing Fire, making that Fire as an Attestor of your friendship... 

"You shall not look down on that lord of monkeys taking him as a lowly simian, why because that Sugreeva 
is a valiant one, a guise changing wizard and presently he is in the need of a bolsterer, and if you 
render help he will be obligated to you for ever... 
"Now you two are capable enough to effectuate the desired task of Sugreeva, isn't it... whether his 
own purpose is achieved through you or not, he will effectuate your task... 
"Sugreeva is the son of Riksharaja, and the direct son of the Sun, but Vali trespassed against him. 
Wary of Vali's onslaughts Sugreeva is wandering around Pampa... 
"Oh, Raghava, right away and candidly you make that monkey Sugreeva, a wanderer in the forest, sheltering 
himself on Mt. Rishyamuka, as a friend of yours taking an oath on your weapon besides the Fire-witness... 

"With his expertise that straightforward monkey Sugreeva is indeed conversant with all of the strongholds 
of anthropophagite demons in the world in their entirety... 
"Oh, enemy-subjugator Rama, as far as the thousand rayed sun manifestly irradiates the world, oh, Raghava, 
thus far, nothing in the least is unfamiliar to him, isn't it... 
"He makes the monkeys to purposefully rake over the expansive rivers, extensive mountains and their 
impassable cliffs and caves in locating your wife... 
"Oh, Raghava, he expedites giant bodied monkeys in all directions to search for her, who is agonised 
by your parting, and he quests after the residence of Ravana for that comely lady Maithili... 
"Whether that unreprovable ladylove of yours, Seetha, is located on the tops of Mt. Meru's peaks, or 
abiding on the planes of nadir of the earth, he that defiant one among fly-jumpers, Sugreeva, on entering 
there and annihilating the demons, he again bestows Seetha to you..." So Kabandha continued his advise 
to Rama regarding Sugreeva. In this way, Raghava-s on offering water oblations to Jataayu went southwestward in the forest and proceeded 
looking around for Seetha. 
On going in southwest direction, both the Ikshvaku-s wielding bows, arrows, and swords, have come about 
a pathway which is an off the beaten track. 
That pathway is thickly wrapped in and penned up with numerous trees, climber plants, and hedgerows 
from all over, thus that is jammed, blocked and horrid in its appearance. 
On taking up the southern direction, and on crossing over that highly horrendous and thick of the forest, 
both those spryly energetic brothers moved ahead, speedily. 
Thereafter, both the highly vigorous Raghava-s have entered the impassable Kraunca forest, on going 
three krosa-s from Janasthaana. 
Those two brothers who are disquieted by the abduction of Seetha are now agog to find her, and they 
intently explored that forest temporising there and there. That forest is evocative of a congeries of 
many a black-cloud, and it embodies numerous flowers on many a flowered tree, numerous flights of birds 
flitting over them, and numerous animals sprawling under them, and with them that forest is as though 
highly rejoiced everywhere. 
Then, both the brothers on passing over that Kraunca forest and on going from there eastwardly on a 
three-krosha route, those sons of Dasharatha have seen a horrendous forest in between Kraunca forest 
and Matanga hermitage, which is overspread with various thicketed and impassable trees, and over-sprawled 
by numerous gigantic predators and vulturine birds, and on scrutinising such a forest everywhere, there 
they saw a cave in a mountain, which is abyssal, equal to infernal region, and ever enshrouded by gloom. 

On getting at that cave those manly-tigers have seen a demoness nearby that cave, who is massive in 
shape and misshapen in her face. 
Both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, have seen a demoness there, who is an inducer of horror to the 
dunderheaded dullards, traumatic in her acts and truculent in her appearance, pot-bellied, pierce-fanged, 
overblown, pachydermatous, head hair shaggy, body shape lumpy-bumpy, and she is going on eating massive 
beasts. 
Drawing nigh of those valorous brothers who are journeying on their way, that demoness actually clung 
onto Lakshmana who is going ahead of his elder brother, saying, "come... let's romance..." 
Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, "I am Ayomukhi, by my name... you won 
me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over... thus, you alone are my lover... 
oh, hero, oh, my husband... you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, 
till the end of this life..." So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. 
When said that way that enemy-suppressor Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared 
off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts. 
When her nose and ear are cut off that demoness of hideous mien yelled highly in a high voice, and she 
rushed off as she had rushed in at Lakshmana. 
When she fled those two brothers who are the eliminators of the friends of their enemies, have travelled 
further into the forest and entered a dense area of that forest, with their spiritedness as their guiding 
force. 
Though Lakshmana is the one with preparedness, properness, and pureness and thus a highly fulgent one 
by his persona, he prayfully said this sentence to his brother Rama whose anima is radiantly fulgorous. 

"My left arm is strongly shuddering and my heart is as though distraught... and even undesirable forebodings 
are also bidding fair... 
"Oh, exalted brother, thereby you be at the ready by paying attention to my expedient words... these 
forebodings are indeed portending to me as if some hazard is immediately ensuing... 
"This eerily dreadful bird known to be Vanjulaka is loudly ululating as though presaging our triumph 
in any given conflict that may ensue..." So said Lakshmana to Rama. 
When those two brothers are searching entire forest for Seetha in that way, they heard a boisterous 
brouhaha emanated as though to completely shatter down that forest. 
As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the forest, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably 
filling up that forest.
As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the sky, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably 
filling up that forest. 
But desiring to know the source of that noise that sword-wielder Rama has seen a gigantically giant-bodied 
and gigantesque-chested demon in a section of brushwood along with his younger brother Lakshmana. 
Then they both had to drew nigh of a waylaying demon Kabandha, who is situated frontally with an overgrown 
body, which is neckless, ergo headless, ergo mouth in paunch. 
That diabolical demon is peaking like a huge mountain, his hair is horripilate and thickset, and his 
gleam is like a dark cloud, and his sounding is like a thunder. 
Only one ochry eye blazing like the tongue of an inferno is there on his forehead, which forehead situated 
on his chest. That single eye with incisive and sharp-sight is broad beaming and wide angling, on which 
there are winglike eyelids. That monster is now licking his giant mouth that is stuffed with spearhead 
like fangs, as he has just finished a gobble, and the brothers had to drew nigh of such a demon. 
He is eating the highly brutal bears, lions, predators, and elephants, and he is outstretching both 
of his deadly arms, each of which is stretchable to a yojana distance, and the bothers neared such a 
demon. 
That demon stayed waylaying the pathway of both the brothers who chanced there, while he is catching 
bears, divers flights of birds, and numerous choicest animals of those and those herds, gripping them 
with both of his long-reaching hands and hauling towards his mouth at his paunch, or dropping them off 
if they are unpalatable, and the brothers reached nearby of such a demon. 
On travelling just a krosha distance, then they have seen Kabandha, whose body is colossal, and who 
is heinous and hideous, and who is like living trunk fenced by its shoulders and arms, and who by his 
physique is very deadly in appearance. 
He that overlong-armed Kabandha outstretching his overlong arms snatched both of the Raghava-s, keeping 
them side-by-side in his fists, and wringing them with his might. 
Though they are the grapplers with swords and brandishers of unerring bows, and though outblazing is 
their pneuma and outstanding is their dexterity, both of those great mighty brothers lost control and 
had to yield themselves to that demon when he captured and dragged them. 
In that situation, that valiant Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s, is not verily anguished owing to his 
courage, but Lakshmana is very much anguished, as if he is callow and in an unsheltered state, and he 
that younger brother of Raghava, namely Lakshmana, also dejectedly said this to Rama, the legatee of 
Raghava-s. 
"Oh, valiant brother, see me, who am out of control on my inner-self, and gone into the control of the 
demon... oh, Raghava, you leave me and get yourself released from the grip of the demon... 
"Indeed offer me as an offering to this quiddity, and you seek safety at your pleasure... and you will 
reach Vaidehi shortly... this is my belief... 
"Oh, Kakutstha, on regaining the kingdom of our father and forefathers, and when enthroned, oh, Rama, 
it will be apt of you to reminisce me always..." So said Lakshmana to Rama. 
But when Lakshmana said that way, Rama said to Soumitri, "Fret not thyself, futilely... oh, brave one, 
your king of persons will not get dismayed, futilely... 
In the meantime, that ruthless, log-armed, fiercest demon Kabandha thunderously asked those brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana. 
"Who are you two? Your shoulders are akin to the bull-humps, and you are shouldering longbows and brandishing 
broad swords, how have you come about this province? For god's sake, I come across my most dainty morsel... 

"What business you have here, and for which reason you have come here... you chanced for me who am sitting 
here and painfully ravenous... 
"Though you are with arrows, bows and swords, and though you are like bulls with sharp horns ready to 
gore... but they are all a waste, as your life has readily become ungainful on reaching nigh of my sight 
and arms..." So said Kabandha, in his arrogant tone. 
On hearing that sentence of that vile-souled Kabandha, Rama said this to Lakshmana with a wilted face. 

"Oh, truth-valiant Lakshmana, now coming to pass is a worst catastrophe, after a worse catastrophe, 
after a catastrophe...namely, the expiration at the hands of this demon presently, and the expropriation 
of Seetha previously, and the expulsion from kingship, still previously... nonetheless, without coming 
across that ladylove, this disastrous despair of ending our lives is coming about... 
"Oh, Lakshmana, the efficacy of Time is preponderant and proportional among all beings... oh, manly-tiger, 
why generalisation... see, as to how yourself and even myself are entangled in the tangles of life, 
even though we assert ourselves to be brave and best... 
Oh, Lakshmana, to show its impact on each and every being Time, or God is unencumbered and unremitting... 
may he be a brave one or a brawny one... or, may they be those that have perfected their missilery... 
when Time chances their nigh, they have to founder... as with a sandy levee... 
Rama being the son of Dasharatha is an indomitable one, besides, a firmly and factually valorous one, 
by which he earned a great renown, and he on telling thus, and on looking over that recalcitrantly vengeful 
Soumitri, then Rama readied himself by his own steadied thinking. On showing a concept for questing after Seetha that context-sensitive Kabandha further spoke this sentence 
which is inclusive of right concept to Rama. 
"Oh, Rama, have a recourse to westward, and where the trees of Rose-apple, Priyaala, Jackfruit, Plaksha, 
Banyan, Tinduka, Pipal, Karnikara, Mango, and others... and even trees like Dhanva, Naaga, Tilaka, Naktamaala, 
blue Ashoka, Kadamba, Karaviira, Agnimukha, Ashoka, red-sandalwood trees and Neem trees will be heart-pleasingly 
shining forth in full blossom, that alone is an optimistic course for you. 
"On shinning up those trees, or else, even on forcefully pelting those fruits down onto ground, then 
you may pelt over, devouring those ambrosial fruits... 
"On crossing over that parkland, oh, Kakutstha, another parkland with blossomy flowers is there, which 
replicates the heavenly Nandana gardens, and a replica of North-Kuru, an all-endowing province... 
"Wherein the trees fruit all-season fruits that transude nectar, why fruits alone, in that parkland 
all seasons are coeval, as they will be in Caitraratha, the celestial gardens of Kubera... 
"In there, the trees bear enormous branches which will be crouching under the weight of their own fruits, 
and everywhere such trees will be shining forth like shiny clouds and shining mountains... 
"Let Lakshmana present those ambrosial fruits to you either by climbing up those trees to pluck them, 
or else by pelting them to ground, according to his convenience... 
"Peregrinating finest places by trekking from mountain to mountain, from forest to forest, oh, valorous 
ones, you will trek to an auspicious lotus-lake, called Pampa... 
"It is un-pebbly, un-slippery, un-weedy thereabouts, oh, Rama, equal are its quaysides and emersed are 
its sandbanks, red and blue lotuses beautify that Pampa Lake... 
"There the indwellers of Pampa Lake's waters, oh, Raghava, namely the swans, cranes, Kraunca-s and fish-hawks 
will be letting out peeps in tuneful voice... 
"Thereabout birds will be unflustered on seeing humans, because they are artless to avoid hunting, because 
none kills them, and you may savour them because those birds will be best and burley, similar to ghee-gobs... 

"Oh, Rama in that Pampa Lake there are best fishes, red-carps, and blunt-snouted small porpoises, and 
a sort of sprats, which are neither scraggy, nor with many fish-bones. Lakshmana will reverentially 
offer them to you on skewering them with arrow, and on broiling them on iron rod of arrow after descaling 
and de-finning them. 
"While you eat those fishes to satiety, Lakshmana will offer you the water of Pampa Lake, which will 
be in the bunches of flowers of that lake, and which will be lotus-scented, pellucid, comfortably cool, 
shiny like silver and crystal, uncontaminated and that way pristine, by lifting it up that water with 
lotus leaf, making that leaf a stoup-like basin... 
"Oh, best one among men Rama, at Pampa you will see best shaped Vanara-s who have their bunk bed in 
mountain caves, and who will be coming nearby the lake, greedy as they are for water, and those forest 
movers will be moving about in evening time of the day, bellowing like bulls... oh, Rama, Lakshmana 
will show them to you... 
"While roving in the evenings, oh, Rama, should you see the serenely water of Pampa, with her trees 
garlanded with their own blooms and twigs, you will discard your own dolour... 
"Oh, Raghava, there you will see highly delightful and wide-ranging trees like Tilaka and Naktamaala, 
and fully bloomed red and blue lotuses, as well... 
"Oh, Raghava, there is none someone to inwreathe the garlands of those flowers, and indeed, they neither 
dry up, nor drop down... 
"Erst there were self-collected sages, the disciples of Sage Matanga, and at one time while they were 
bringing the forest produce as ritual paraphernalia, they were much wearied by its weight and they were 
sweating... and all of those earthbound strings of sweat-drops that quickly dropped from their bodies 
were wafted by air onto trees, and on them they reoccurred as strings of flowers, by the merit of the 
ascesis of those sages... oh, Raghava, since those flowers have emerged from sweat-drops, they are imperishable, 
indeed... 
"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, albeit the passing of those sages through the pearly gates, their maidservant, 
a long-lived one and an anchoress, named Shabari, can be seen there, even today... 
"Oh, Rama, she who always stands by probity will depart to the sphere of heaven, on attending to you, 
for you are the referent to god, and a reverent for one and all... 
"Oh, Rama, thereafter on your taking course to that western bank of Pampa Lake, oh, Kakutstha, there 
you will see the unequalled and arcane place of hermitage of sage Matanga... 
"Sage Matanga so methodised that woodland, where even the elephants are rendered incapable to trespass 
in that hermitage of sage Matanga disturbing its serenity... 
"Oh, the legatee of Raghu, that woodland which in simile is like a godly forest, similar to the heavenly 
Nandana gardens, overspread with divers birds is renowned as 'Matanga woodland', and oh, Rama, you will 
take delight rejoicingly in that woodland... 
"In front of Pampa there is a bountiful but an unclimbable mountain is there with trees in full blossom, 
which is well-protected by baby elephants, and which in earlier times was purposefully created by Brahma, 
and that alone is Mt. Rishyamuka... 
"And should a man sleep on the heights of that mountain, and should he dream of gaining some riches 
in that sleep, he gains that much when he wakes up... 
"But he who is diabolic in his deportment and devilish in comportment, climbs that and hopes to sleep 
soundly, demons capture him while he is in sleep, and rough him up to death, there itself... 
"Oh, Rama, there the blaring trumpet-blasts of baby elephants that amuse themselves at Lake Pampa, and 
of those that are the indwellers of Matanga hermitage, even there on Mt. Rishyamuka are audible... 
"The mighty and massy dark-cloud coloured elephants will be hitting head-on, and with dripping blood 
streams on their jumbo heads and temples, they disperse and move about separately, only to come together 
for yet another round of head-to-head collision... 
"There the elephants are quenched on drinking water of Pampa Lake, that is daintily clean, and neatly 
clear, springlike for touch, and in which all scents of flowers of that lake are included, and then 
they will be collectively re-entering the forests, for they are forest ranging elephants... 
"On your seeing the bears, also thus the tigers and even the exultant sapphire-blue Rurus with black 
stripes there, you will discard your distress... 
"But oh, Rama, a cavernous cave lidded with a boulder stone outshines on that mountain, and oh, Kakutstha, 
problematic is an entry into it... 
"On its right at its eastern opening a delightful lake with highly coolant waters is there, fringed 
with divers trees and fraught with numerous tubers and fruits... 
"Sugreeva dwells in that cave along with four other monkeys, and at times he will be available on the 
peaks of that mountain, even on its bluffs and cliffs, for he is a terrified monkey..." Thus Kabandha 
informed them. 
That impressive Kabandha adorned with divine garlands and abiding in sky scintillating with the grandeur 
of the dazzle of the sun has bidden both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana thus, awaited a bid adieu 
from them. 
Rama and Lakshmana who started off on their peregrination said this sentence to that highly providential 
Kabandha, who is temporising in the sky in their vicinity, thus as "you may proceed..." 
On getting the orders for departure from those two brothers who are highly gladdened at the information 
given by Kabandha, he that Kabandha who is ready to exit, he further said to them thus, "proceed for 
the purpose of achieving your task..." 
Kabandha who redeemed his divine form has now got an aureole around him, and while irradiance is tamping 
whole of his mien, he moved further up on sky and reappeared. And staying in the sky he pointed out 
at the side of Mt. Rishyamuka, and then he reiterated, "you befriend Sugreeva..."and then he vanished. 
"Oh, great dextrous Rama with great daring and dashing, as to how the physique of sun, moon, and even 
that of Indra is there now, my physique was also like that earlier, an unbelievable mien and renowned 
in all the three worlds... 
"Such as I was with an admirable body, disguising myself in this kind of horrendous form which is utterly 
dreadful to the world, I was scaring the forest living sages, there and there... 
"On one day, when a great sage named Sthuulashira was collecting divers forest produce for his Vedic-ritual, 
I scared him with this ugly form and I even exasperated him... 
"On seeing me that sage who is an enforcer of deadly curse cursed me in this way, 'that which is presently 
diabolic and despicable form of yours, hereinafter you will abide in this form alone...' 
"When I begged that enraged sage as, 'even if I have committed this blasphemy owing to my blasphemous 
fate, will there be an end to this blasphemed form of mine, or not...' and then he spoke this word to 
me... 
" 'When Rama incinerates you in an uninhibited forest on chopping off your shoulders, then you will 
regain your own grand and auspicious form...' So said the sage to me... 
"Oh, Lakshmana, you may know as the most handsome son of Danu, and this misshapen form has chanced on 
me owing the ire of Indra in battlefield... 
"I have gladdened Grandparent Braham with severe ascesis and He granted longevity to me, and then a 
kind of recalcitrance touched off in my mind... 
" 'When longevity is acquired by me what Indra can do to me...' thus relying upon that kind of certitude, 
I jousted with Indra in a bout... 
"But the Thunderbolt that has a hundred cutting edges and that which is launched from Indra's hand has 
rammed by head and thighs into my body... 
"When I begged of him saying, 'lead me to the hell of Yama, rather than making me to live this hell 
of a body...' Then Indra said this to me, 'Let the Grandparent Brahma's word about your longevity come 
true...' Thus Indra spared me to me... 
" 'By the impaction of Thunderbolt disarranged are my thighs and head, thereby my mouth went into my 
stomach... and without thighs how can I prowl, without arms how can I scrabble, and without a mouth 
how can I guzzle... and how am I capable to live on, and even that living too, is destined for too long 
a time...' 
"When I said to Indra this way, Indra devised for me yojana long arms, also that way a rapier-fanged 
mouth in my paunch... 
"Such as I am, I have been eating the lions, elephants, animals, and tigers that are on the move in 
this forest, hauling them in with both of my overlong arms... 
"Indra has also said to me, 'as and when Rama hacks off your arms along with Lakshmana in a conflict, 
then you can go to heaven...' Thus Indra said to me and vanished. 
"Oh, sire, I am grabbing whatever I see in this forest while living with this body... oh, powerful king, 
as I feel it meetly and a must for me... 
"I believed that Rama will certainly come nigh of my captivity, and confiding myself in this kind of 
determination, presaged by sage Sthuulashira, as well... I have been toiling to dislodge this body... 

"Oh, Raghava, as to how this has happened in this way according to the sum and substance told by the 
sage Sthulashira, you alone are that Rama, let safe betide you, and none other than you is capable to 
mangle me... 
"Oh, impetuous man Rama, if I were to be beatified by you two by incinerating me in Fire, I will advice 
you about the next course of your action... I will further advise you about your prospective friend..." 
So said Kabandha to Rama. 
When Raghava is said thus by that Kabandha, the heir of Danu, that duty-minded Rama said this word to 
Kabandha while Lakshmana is hearing. 
"Ravana conveniently stole my illustrious wife when myself and my brother exited from Janasthaana... 

"I only know his name but not the form of that demon... and we are unaware either of his stronghold 
or of his staying power... 
"It will be apt of you to show befitting mercy on us who are anguished by agony, running all over helter-skelter 
like unsheltered ones, and we who will be compliant for your restitution... 
"Oh, brave Kabandha, on bringing dried up firewood that was rent at times by elephants, and on digging 
a large trench, we will incinerate you in it... 
"Such as you are, if you actually know who stole Seetha, or whereto she is stolen, either... you clearly 
inform of her when incinerated, thus you will be rendering a most gracious deed to me, and to all concerned..." 
Thus Rama made clear of his case. 
When he is said thus that expert articulator Kabandha replied Rama, who is also an expert enunciator, 
with expedient words. 
"There is no divine knowledge to me as of now... nor I can identify Maithili... but when I am burnt 
I assume my own original divine form, and then I will be able tell about him, who will find her out... 

"With this unburnt body, oh, Rama, I indeed have no ability to discern anything, hence oh, lord, I will 
be able to speak about him who can familiarise you with that great mighty demon, by whom your Seetha 
is stolen, only after that incineration... 
"Oh, Raghava, utterly distorted is my acumen, indeed, by the blemish of curse... and this form which 
is despicable to world has bechanced only because of my own antics... 
"Oh, Rama, soon you have to toss me into trench to burn me customarily, sooner than the Sun's going 
to Mt. Dusk when his horses are fatigued... 
"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, when I am scripturally burnt by you in a trench, oh, great valiant 
Rama, for sure, I will tell of him, who can quiet fathom that demon... 
"Oh, Raghava, you have to befriend him with an amicable comportment... and that valiantly alacritous 
one will be gladdened by the sequel of your friendship, and he will evolve a succour to you... 
"Oh, Raghava, nothing is there in all the three worlds that is unfamiliar to him, for he circumnavigated 
all worlds once, in a different context... On prying at those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are completely stowed in the hangman's halter-like 
arms of the demon, and who are enduring within it, Kabandha said this sentence to them. 
"Oh, excellent Kshatriya-s, on seeing me who am miserably famished, really what for you stay cool? You 
are the godsend gobs of mine, and hence now you are almost dead..." So said Kabandha to brothers. 
Lakshmana who is possessed by anguish, and who is determined to wreck revenge on that demon, said these 
expedient and advisable words to Rama on hearing that demon's word. 
"This scurrilous demon quickly hauled in you and me to his face level, and he will quickly take us in, 
therefore, we will have to swiftly hack off his lengthy arms at his shoulder level... 
"Gruesome is this gargantuan bodied demon, and triumphing over just with his arms he has utterly devastated 
this province, and he now wishes to end us... 
"Oh, king Raghava, killing the non-aggressive is tantamount to the killing of animals that are led into 
Vedic-ritual in its midst is despicable to the kings... 
On hearing all of their conversation that demon is infuriated, and then widely opening his ferocious 
mouth he started to wolf down both of them. 
Then both the Raghava-s are very highly gladdened as the demon is hauling them towards his eye at shoulder 
level, and as they are the brothers with circumspection, they instantly mutilated his arms right at 
their shoulder joints only with two swords. 
Then that dextrous Rama with an unrestrained speed hacked off the right arm, and valiant Lakshmana on 
his part hewed down the left arm that speedily. 
He that overlong-armed Kabandha fell down with mangled arms, reverberated the sky, earth, and all of 
the ten points of horizon with a cacophonous voice, like a black-thunderous-cloud. 
That demon on seeing at his dissevered shoulders on which the gushes of blood are overflowing, he self-piteously 
asked those two bold ones thus as, "who are you..." 
When that great mighty Kabandha is asking thus, Lakshmana who has prosperous characteristics has informed 
him about Rama of Kakutstha, an unremitting dynasty. 
"He is known to people by the name of Rama, the legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty, and you know me as his 
younger brother, Lakshmana, by my name... 
"Countervailed from kingdom by mother this Rama is bluntly sent to forests, and he is on the rove in 
great forests along with me ad his wife... 
"A demon stole his wife while he whose leverage is like that of god is living in the unpopulated forest... 
and wishing to retrieve her we came here... 
"But who are you? Your legs are broken, and your mouth is infernal, yet it is on your chest, and alike 
a topless, rootless tree trunk you are sprawling in the forest, how so, or, for what reason?" Lakshmana 
asked the demon thus. 
But Kabandha is highly delighted when Lakshmana spoke that way, as the words of Indra came to his memory, 
and he said these words in reply. 
"Oh, manly tigers, by my providence you are revealed to me... welcome to you... and providentially sheared 
are these shackles, called my two arms, by you... 
"Oh, manly tiger, actually how this form of mine is disfigured, of course owing to my distrustful behaviour, 
that you may listen while I narrate it to you. Having been thus wrongly preached by that sinful Manthara. Kaikeyi lied down on the floor as a Kinnara woman beaten by a poisoned arrow.
The skilful Kaikeyi, after deciding in mind what ought to be done told it all slowly to Manthara.
Being stupefied by the words of Manthara, that Kaikeyi became dejected, made firm
resolve, with deep and warm sigh, like a maiden-serpent and thought for that moment about the ways which can lead to her happiness.
Manthara, who is Kaikeyi's companion and who is desirous of getting benefit, heard of Kaikeyi's firm resolve and became very much pleased as if she achieved success.
Kaikeyi, being angry and well determined, lied down on the floor with eye brows,
knitted in her face.
Thereafter, she threw away her colourful chaplets and beautiful ornaments on to the floor.
Those chaplets and ornaments which were thrown away by her were making the earth
shine, as stars to the sky.
Tying her single braid of hair tightly over her head and wearing soiled clothes,
that Kaikeyi lying down in the chamber of wrath was looking like a Kinnara woman lying down dead.
King Dasaratha ordered for various arrangements to be made for Rama's coronation,
took permission to leave from the elders who were present there and entered his palace.
king Dasaratha, who kept all activates under his control entered into the inner
chambers to tell the good news of Rama's coronation to Kaikeyi who was a worthy woman to be told the good news first (thinking that she has not yet heard the news).
That Dasaratha with vast glory entered Kaikeyi's chambers as moon enters the sky
with white clouds.
King Dasaratha entered his magnificent palace but could not find his beloved kaikeyi on her best couch there. Peacocks and parrots were being reared in that palace, sounds of birds like curlews, and swans were heard around. The place was resonant with sounds of musical instruments. Short and hunch-backed maid-servants were moving here and there. There were bowers surrounded with creepers and lovely champaka and Ashoka trees. There were painted rooms. There were altars built with ivory, silver and gold. There were trees yielding flowers and fruits in all
seasons and wells in the middle. There were beautiful seats constructed with ivory, silver and gold. Various types of food, drinks and snacks were made available. That palace was looking like heaven with beautifully adorned women.
Being possessed of power of lust, that king who came with object of sexual pleasure, was distressed in not finding his beloved wife and enquired the people there.
In former times, Kaikeyi did not keep away herself at that kind of hour, nor the
king enter her chambers at any time without her presence.
After entering the house, king Dasaratha enquired with the aid-servants there as
before, without knowing about foolish Kaikeyi who desired to get her selfish ends.
Then, a female door-keeper fearfully folding her hands in supplication, said: "Oh, king! The queen ran to her chamber of wrath with much anger".
That Dasaratha having much disturbed mind already for the absence of Kaikeyi there, became more dejected after hearing the words of door-keeper.
King Dasaratha, after seeing Kaikeyi lying down on floor in the chamber of wrath,
became tormented with grief.
That Dasaratha, who was sinless, a youthful woman dearer than his life, lying down on the floor with an intent to do sin. At that time, she was looking like a completely uprooted creeper, like a fallen angel, like a thrown down Kinnara woman, like an expelled divine dancer Apsarasa, like a dropped off illusionism and like a female deer tied up in a net.
That Dasaratha touched Kaikeyi affectionately, as a great elephant in a forest
touches a female elephant which is wounded by poisoned arrow.
That Dasaratha, possessed with infatuation and having fearful mind, touched that
lotus-eyed woman with his hands and spoke the following words.
"Oh queen, of auspicious qualities! I do not know that you are angry with me. Who
has cursed or disrespected you? I am pained to see you resting in this way on a dirty floor."
"when I am here to expend all good to you, why are you hurting my mind by lying down on the floor like the one who is possessed of a devil."
"There are so many royal physicians who are skilled and famous on all sides. They
can make you healthy. Tell me your sickness".
"To whom do you want a favour to be done? who has offended you? Tell me to whom I
have to extend a favour now and to whom I have to do a great offensive act."
"Oh, Kaikeyi! Do not weep and get your body dried up. If you tell, I shall kill a
person who is exempt from death or shall release a person who is worthy to be killed. I shall make a poor man prosperous or a rich man, destitute".
"I and all my people are submissive to you. I do not wish to foil even a little of your intention".
"Tell me that which is desired by your mind to be achieved even at the cost of my
life. You need not suspect me, as you very well know your authority over me. I keep my oath on my righteousness that I shall certainly do whatever is liked by you".
My jurisdiction over this earth stretches out as much to the extent as to the extent a chariot-wheel revolves. Eastern countries, Sindhu, Sauviira and Saurastra countries, as well as countries in the south, Vanga, Anga, Magadha and Matsya countries, Kasi and Kausala countries are all full of riches.
In those countries, gold and grain, sheep and goats and all types of goods are
produced. Oh, Kaikeyi! which of the goods do you want to acquire?
"Oh, fearful one! why are you exerted like this? oh, beautiful lady? Get up get up! Oh, Kaikeyi1 Tell me the source of your fear. I shall remove that source as sun sets aside the mist."
Consoled by hearing the words of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi intending to tell unkindly words like Rama's exile was beginning to harass her husband further, by her words.That brilliant and glorious Bharata, who was a rejoice to Ikshvaku dynasty marching in easterly direction from the city of Rajagriha, thereafter observing and crossing Sudama* river as well as the wide Hladini river, whose stream flowed towards eastern direction.
The pure and illustrious Bharata, who kept up his promise, crossing shatradru river at Eladhana village, reaching the region of Apara parpata, crossing a rocky hill called akurvati, seeing the villages of Agneyam and salyakartana as well as Silavaha river, crossed huge mountains and traveled towards the woods of Chitraratha.
Arriving at the confluence of Saraswati and Ganga rivers, Bharata entered the woods of Bharmuda, the north of Viramatsaya region.
Reaching and crossing a refreshing river named Kulinga, which is swift and
surrounded by mountains as well as Yamuna river, the army was then made to rest there.
Making cool the limbs of the tired horses by bathing there and cheering up them,
nay, taking a bath himself, drinking some water and carrying it for future use, Bharata proceeded further.
The blessed prince Bharata traversed that rarely frequented huge forest by his
excellent chariot as the wind glides through an atmosphere.
Bharata soon reached the great river, Bharathi, which is difficult to be crossed, at the city of pragvata in the region of Amsudhana.
Crossing the River Ganga at the city of Pragvata, he reached the river
Kulikoshthika, traversed it along with his army and then arrived at the region of
Dharmavardhana.
Bharata reached Jambuprasta village, which is located at the southern part of Torana region and from there he arrived at a beautiful village too, named Varutha.
Making a camp in thatbeautiful forest there, Bharata traveled towards the east and reached a garden in the city of Ujjihana, in which there are a number of Kadamba trees.
Having reached Sala and Kadamba trees, Bharata yoked swifter horses to his chariot, allowed his army to come after him and quickly went ahead.
Having halted min Sarvatirtha village and having crossed Uttamika river and various other rivers by mountain -ponies and reaching Hast prasthaka village, Bharata crossed Kutika river and traversed kapivati river at Lohitya village.
Bharata, after crossing Sthanumati river at Ekasala village and Gomati river at
Vinata village, took rest at a grove of Sala trees at Kalinga city as the horses were very much tired and then proceeded quickly.
Driving through grove quickly in the night, Bharata at the dawn saw the city of
Ayodhya, which was earlier built by King Manu.
Seeing the city of Ayodhya in front, after spending seven nights on his way, Bharata the tiger among men, spoke the following words to his charioteer:
"O, Charioteer! The famous city of Ayodhya comes into view vaguely to me from a
distance, as a heap of white clay. It has beautiful gardens. It is filled with performers of sacrifices and with people endowed with good qualities as well as well versed in the Vedas and with Brahmins inmost abundant reaches , It is being ruled by a royal sage."
Earlier , a big clattering voice of men and women used to be heard all round in
Ayodhya. Now, I am not hearing that voice."
"The parks which used to beam with men streaming forth on all sides, having given up sporting in the morning after entering them in thee evening having spent the whole night in sport, now appear to me otherwise"
"These parks deserted by the lovers now turn out to be dejected . O, charioteer! To me, the city appears to have changed into a forest."
"Here, as before, important persons indeed are not seen going into the city or
coming out it in carriages or on horses or on elephants."
"Earlier parks used to be conspicuously excited with joy and gaiety and were most
congenial for love contacts of men."
"I am seeing the same parks., today with lack of enjoyments on all sides and with
trees having their leaves fallen along the road, looking like picture of dismay."
"Even now at dawn, charming sounds with sweet and much melodious tone of animals and birds intoxicated with happiness are not being heard."
"Why does, as before, pure and auspicious breeze laden with aloes and sandal wood
intensified with the fume of burnt incense,not blow today.?"
"Why today have the sounds of kettledrums, clay tomtoms and Vinas played upon with drum-sticks or palms or fingers stopped which formerly never ceased at any time."
"I perceive various kinds of evil sinful and silly omens and by this, my mind is
dejected."
"O, charioteer! It is not possible that all sounds be well with my kinsfolk, as
indeed, even without anycause for a grievance, my spirit is cast down"
Despondent, distressed in mind, frightened and extremely entered the city, which was ruled by the descendents of Ikshvaku.
Bharata, with his tiered horses entered the city through Vaijayanta gate. Greeted
with slogans of victory by the standing gatekeepers, he went inside, along with others.
Bharata, with a distracted mind, responded to the salutations of those porters at
the gate and those porters at the gate and spoke to the charioteer who was beloved to Asvapati as follows:
"O, the faultless charioteer! Why was I brought so quickly without any reason? My
mind is apprehending some evil. I lost my all energy."
"Whatever things were heard by us formerly in the same case of ruin of kings, I am seeing here all those signs."
"I am seeing the family horses in which dirt is not swept away, with their doors
wide open, bereft of splendor on all sides without any offerings being made, and with no incense burned . Families are starving and people look miserably without any charming appearance."
"The temples of gods are deserted and have lost their radiance, with their splendor of floral decorations lost, nor are there any assembling to perform sacrifices as before."
"Worships of the deities were placed aside. Assemblies of prayers are also not
adorned with saleable flowers and garlands today."
"Even traders lost interest in trading tie-ups and their minds are tied up in
thoughts. They are not being seen here today, as before."
"Clusters of birds in temples and large trees in the city are looking desolate. The population of men and women in the city look thoughtful anguished weak messy and despondent with their eyes held in tears."
After seeing those bad omens in Ayodhya, the broken hearted Bharata spoke to the
charioteer as aforesaid and went to the royal palace.
Beholding the city of Ayodhya,that formerly possessed the splendor of the capital
city of Indra, now with its squares houges and high ways deserted, the doors and hinges covered with rust , Bharata was overcome with grief.
Seeing many things disenchanted to mind which did not occur at any time before in
the city, the high soled Bharata with his head bent down and with his mind miserable gloomily entered his father's house.Hearing the words of the chief minister, Rama who was well-versed in courtesy, spoke then to Dasaratha as follows:
"Of what use for me, who have forsaken enjoyments, cast away attachment for
everything and am going to live in the forest on nomadic food, Oh king, with an army accompanying me?"
"Who, after giving away a first-class elephant, will work out his mind on a rope
with which it is tied? What use is there for him through attachment to the rope after abandaning the excellent elephant?"
"Oh, the best among good men! So also, what use is there for me by the army Oh,
King, when I am giving away absolutely all. Let the dresses of a mendicant be brought to me.'
"I am going to reside in the abode of forest for fourteen years. Bring a shoel and a basket both for me."
Thereupon, Kaikeyi shamelessly bringing personally of men, said to Rama; "Put these on"
Taking those two pieces of bark (as loin cloth and cover) from kaikeyi and
discarding his clothing of fine yarn, Rama put on the garb of ascetics.
Lakshmana too there itself before his father put on the clothing of ascetics, by
discarding his beautiful raiment.
Then, Seetha who wore silken clothing, by seeing the piece of bark intended to be
worne by her, felt alarming as a deer would on seeing a snare(set for entrapping)
Feeling abashed while taking the wearing apparel made of Kusa grass and greatly
troubled in mind, Seetha who bore auspicious marks knew what is righteousness who was an illustration of righteousness spoke these words with her eyes filled with tears to her husband who looked like Chitraratha(the king of Gandharvas)
"How ascetics residing in the forest wear this piece of bark?" Thus saying, Seetha who was not adept in wearing the bark of trees, erred again and again(in her attempt to wear it)
Keeping one piece of bark on her neck as well as holding it with her hand, Seetha
stood abashed, not adept as she was in wearing it.
Rama, the foremost of those upholding virute, quicky came and personally fastened
that bark over the sild garment of Seetha.
Seeing the greatest Rama fastening the bark to Seetha in that manner, the women in the gynaecium shed tears from their eyes.
Very much distress as they were, they spoke to Rama of dazzling glory as follows: " Dear child! This Seetha the high sould, was not so commanded to reside in the forest."
"When you departed to the forest in seclusion following the words of your father, Oh Rama, let her sight be a reward to us till your return."
" You go to the forest along with Lakshmana as your companion Oh son! Seetha the
beautiful girl is not fit to reside in a forest like an ascetic."
"Accept our prayer, Oh son! Let Seetha the beautiful young lady stay here. Indeed, you the ever righteous in any case do not wish to stay back.
Even after hearing their words in this manner, Rama fastened that piece of bark to Seetha, who has a well-matched nature.
Seeing Seetha accepting the piece of bark, Vasistha the king's preceptor prevented her and spoke thus to Kaikeyi.
"Oh the evil minded Kaikeyi, who have exceeded your limits, who have brought
disgrace to your family! You are not establishing justifiable standard and you misled the king.
"Oh, the woman without decorum! Seetha the princess shall not proceed to forest. She will occuply the throne, which was awarded to Rama."
"A wife is very self to all, who constantly care for their wives. As Seetha is
Rama's self, she can rule the earth."
"Or rather, if Seetha goes to forest together with Rama, we also will follow suit. This city too will go."
"The fronitier- guards and the State including its patrons, as well as this city
with its goods and chattels will go whereever Rama and his wife are there."
"Wearing pieces of bark, Bharata along with Shatrughna will live along with Rama
their brother residing in the forest and moving in the forest."
Thereafter, singly you alone with bad conduct hurt to people, rule this earth which is bereft of people and desolate, with its trees alone remaining.
"Where Rama is not a king, that place will not indeed become on kingdom. That
forest, where Rama will be living, can become a kingdom."
"If Bharata is born to king Dasaratha, he is not fit either to rule the earth that is not being offered by his father nor to live as a son in your case."
"Even if you can jump from the surface of the earth to the sky, Bharata who knows
the record of his father's dynasty will not do as you wish him to do"
"therefore, an unfriendly act(alone) has been done by you, eventhough you are
covetons towards his well-being. There is none indeed in this world who is not devoted to Rama"
"Oh, Kaikeyi! You will see now itself that beasts, elephants, deers and birds going with Rama and trees also turning their faces towards Rama."
"Moreover, putting aside the bark of trees, give excellent jewellery to your
daughter-in-law, Oh, Kaikeyi! the bark of trees is not ordained for her" Thus saying so, Vasishta prevented that wearing of garment by Seetha.
"Oh, Kaikeyi! It was solicited by you, the dwelling in the forest of Rama only. Let Seetha, to be decorated daily, be adorned with ornaments and live in the forest along with Rama."
"Let Seetha go with excellent conveyances, well accompanied by attendants, with all costumes and useful accessories. Her exile was not indeed solicted by you, while asking for boons"
Eventhough Vasista, the preceptor of the king, who had an influenc beyond compare
and the best of brahmanas was speaking as above, Seetha did not turn away here resolution to follow the ways of her beloved husband.Kaikeyi spoke harsh words to that king, who was struck by cupid's arrows and yielded to hasty lust.
"Oh, King! no body has insulted me, nor despised me. But I have a certain, desire
that needs to be fulfilled by you."
"If you wish to fulfil my desire, you promise to fulfil it. After your promise I
shall inform you that which is desired by me."
The most majestic and lustful Dasaratha smiled a little and caressingly kept his
hand into her hair and spoke these words to Kaikeyi who was having white smile in her face.
"Oh, proud woman! Don't you know that there is nobody on this earth more dearer to me than you except Rama, the best among men."
"Rama cannot be defeated by enemies. He is a very important person in our family. He is the supporter of life and a high souled man. I take oath by him. Tell me what is desired by you".
"Oh, Kaikeyi ! I can't live even for a moment without seeing Rama. This is certain.
By that Rama, I am taking my oath and promising to fulfill your word".
"I desire the well being of Rama, the best of men, even at the cost of my life or
the lives of my other sons. I take oath by that Rama and tell you that I shall fulfil your word."
"Oh, auspicious lady! My heart is sinking. You raise it by your touch. Oh, Kaikeyi! you observe all this and tell me that which you think as good."
"You need not doubt me as you know your authority over me. I am taking oath on my
auspiciousness. I shall do whatever is desired by you."
That Kaikeyi, who has utmost desire for coronation of Bharata and for sending Rama to exile, revealing that wish from her mind, uttered unspeakable wordswith bias and delight.
Kaikeyi, having been delighted with Dasaratha's words, conveyed him of the very
horrible wish in her mind as conveying the news of a suddenly befallen death.
"Let thirty three celestials with the god of Fire in the forefront hear your words giving boons to me, preceded by series of your oaths"
"Let your words be heard by sun, moon, sky, planets, day, night, the directions,
universe, earth, celestial musicians, demons, spirits wandering in nights , house-gods and other spirits."
"King Dasaratha, who has true promise, who has great valour, who knows righteousness and who has good equanimity of mind, is giving boon to me. Let the celestials hear it for my sake."
Kaikeyi made Dasaratha to hear these words, praised him too much and thereafter
spoke these words to him who was ready to give boons as he was infatuated by lust.
"Oh, King! Remember what happened in the battle between celestials and demons in the olden times. There the enemy destroyed almost every thing except your life".
"Oh, King! There, I saved you. Hence you gave boon to myself who was attentive in
trying to save you."
"Oh, King! The protection of the Earth, the one who has true promise! I am hunting for those boons, which were given by you and kept with you for safe custody."
"You have to give that boon, as per right, to me as promised by you. If you despise me by not giving it, I should abandon my life now itself".
Dasaratha, after having thus yielded in full measure to kaikeyi's words, fell into her trap as a deer, for his self destruction.
There-afterwards, Kaikeyi spoke these words to Dasaratha who was ready to give boons and who was infatuated by lust: "Oh, King! the lord of Earth, now only I am asking for those boons which were given by you then. Listen to my words".
"All arrangements have been made to undertake Rama's coronation. Let my Bharata
instead be coronated on this occasion itself".
"Now, the time has arrived for the second boon given by you affectionately then in the battle between celestials and demons."
"Rama has to take refuge in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years and let him
become an ascetic wearing rags, deer skin and matted hair".
"Now itself, Bharata has to get rights of succession to kingdom, which is free of
enemies. This is my greatest desire. Now I am asking for the boon given by you in earlier. "
"Oh King of the Kings, Dasaratha ! Be true to your promise and protect your caste, character and birth. Are not the ascetics tell that for human beings to get happiness in another world, they have to speak only the truth."Rama saw his father sitting on a beautiful seat, but with his face looking
completely parched up and miserable. Kaikeyi was at his side.
Rama being humble and well composed, first reverentially saluted his father's feet and then saluted Kaikeyi's feet.
Dasaratha spoke only one word "Rama!" with his eyes filled with tears and dejected, being not able to see or to talk any further words.
Having not seen earlier such a fearful form of his father, even Rama was frightened as though he seized a snake by his foot.
That king Dasaratha was sighing heavily with senses sans pleasure, emaciated with
grief and anguish, with distressed and agitated mind, like ocean which cannot be perturbed, becoming perturbed with row of waves, like sun which is eclipsed and who lost lustre like by a sage who spoke untruth.
Contemplating over the unimaginable sorrow of the king, he was very much perturbed as an ocean does on a full moon day.
The ingenious Rama, who is fond of his father's welfare, anxiously thought : " why indeed the king is not greeting me in return just today?"
"At other times, the father, even though angry used to be gracious after seeing me why today such a father has become weary after seeing me?"
Rama indeed distressed and afflicted with grief, with lustre faded from his face,
offered his salutation to Kaikeyi and spoke these words.
"I hope that I have not done anything wrong through ignorance. Tell me why father is angry with me. You alone propitiate him in my favour."
"Why my father, who was always affectionate to me, has become displeased? With his face becoming pale and dejected, he is not talking to me."
"I hope that either bodily affliction or mental distress is not troubling him. The object of happiness is indeed difficult to be attained always!"
"I hope that no bad thing occurred to Bharata, the delightful man to look at or to Shatrughna, the man of great strength or to my mother. "
"If our father becomes angry, I do not desire to live even for a moment without
satisfying him or without fulfilling his command."
"Man sees father as the visible god who is the root cause of one's own coming into existence and how else can he behave towards him other than like that?"
"I hope you have not spoken anything which hurt my father's conscience with your
pride and anger."
"I am asking you why my father got this perturbation, which was not there earlier.
Tell me the true position."
Thus questioned by the great souled Rama, Kaikeyi fearlessly spoke these words for her own benefit, without any shame on her part.
"Oh, Rama! The king is not angry. There is nothing of distress for him. But he has something in mind which he is not telling from fear."
"To him, words are not coming off to tell disagreeable utterance to you, the dear
one. He promised me a word. It is to be certainly done by you."
"Long ago, the king honoured me and gave me a boon. Like a common man, he is
repenting now for having given the boon."
"This king promised me to give the boon and now he desires to build a dam wastefully on a place where water has gone away."
"Oh, Rama! It is known by even wise men, that truth is the root of righteousness.
See that the offended king does not abandon such a truth for your sake."
"The king is about to mention that truth which may look auspicious or inauspicious to you. Still, I shall tell you all that, if you shall do it afterwards."
"If what is spoken by the king does not create unfavourableness in you, I shall then tell you. This king will not indeed tell you."
After hearing the words of Kaikeyi, Rama felt painful and spoke thus to her in the presence of the king.
"Oh, queen! what a pity! Do not talk like that to me. If father tells me, I shall
jump even in fire. If father, who is a king, who wishes my welfare and who is venerable, commands me, I shall eat fiery poison and shall sink into an ocean."
"Oh queen! Tell me the words of the king as desired by him. I even promise to do it. Rama does not speak two things."
That vulgar Kaikeyi uttered very cruel words to that Rama, who was committed to
sincerity and speaking of truth.
"Oh, Rama! During a battle and a great war between celestials and demons long ago, I protected your father who was pierced by darts. Then, he gave me two boons."
"Oh, Rama! According to those boons, I asked the king for coronation of Bharata and for your going to Dandaka forest today itself."
"Oh, Rama! If you want to make yourself and your father faithful to a promise,
listen to these words of mine.
"Abide by your father's command. As per his assurance, you have to stay in the
forest for fourteen years."
"Bharata is to be enthroned with the use of complete collection of materials already arranged by the king for your sake."
"You have to leave this coronation function and dwell in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide."
"Let Bharata rule this earth, by residing in Ayodhya filled with various types of
precious thing together with horses, chariots and elephants."
"For this reason, king Dasaratha who is overwhelmed with sympathy towards you is not able to see you with his face, afflicted with grief."
"Oh, Rama! Do as per the words of the king and liberate him by giving your father an opportunity to maintain the truth."
Though she was speaking such harsh words, Rama was not affected with sorrow. But the mighty Dasaratha became highly disturbed, having been afflicted by the calamity occurred to his son.Kausalya, the magnanimous mother putting away her grief, sipped water from the palm of the hand, became purified and performed rites conducive to the welfare of Rama.
"Oh, Rama! Your departure cannot be restrained, depart now, return soon. Abide in
the footsteps of the virtuous."
"Oh, Rama! Let that righteousness, which you are fostering with courage and
discipline , protect you".
"Oh, son! To whom you will be bowing in salutation at cross-roads and in temples,
those along with great saints will protect you in the forest.
"All the arms given by the wise sage Viswamitra to you, will ever protect you who
are rich in good qualities"
"Oh, son with magnificent arms! Protected by your service to father and service to mother as well as truthfulness, you will belong-lived"
"Oh, Rama, the best among men! May the wooden sticks used for feeding the sacred
fire, blades of the sacred Kusa grass and rings of Kusa grass(worn on the forth finger on sacrificial occasions)sacrificial altars , temples and various sites selected by Brahmanas for worship of gods, mountains, trees, bushes, large and deep pools of water, birds, snakes and lions protect you."
"May the saadhyas and viswadevas (two different kinds of gods) and wind-gods along with eminent sages ensure your happiness. May the cosmic person and the creator bring happiness to you. May the Pusha, Bhaga and Aryama (three of the twelve sons of Aditi)and the guardians of the spheres with Indra as their Head do good to you."
"May the six seasons, all the fortnights and months, years, nights, days and hours always do good to you.
"May Veda, the Smriti texts taken as one body, the resolution and the piety protect you, my son! May lord Skanda (the younger son of Lord Siva)and the moon god along with the sage Brihaspati(the preceptor of gods), the well known seven sages as well as Sage Narada guard you on all sides."
"May the four quarters along with the glorious guardians of the four quarters which are enlogised by me may protect you always on all sides in that forest."
" Let all mountains , oceans, king(of oceans) Varuna, heaven and earth, the
intermediate space between them , rivers , astrological mansions including gods presiding over them, day and night, the morning and evening twilights may protect you while you reside in the forest ."
"The six holy seasons, months, years and the measures of time known as Kala
(equilent to one minute) and Kastha(1/30th of Kala or two seconds)bestow you happiness"
"Let the heavenly deities and the demons too ever grant happiness on you while you traverse through the large forest, in the guise of a hermit and full of wisdom "
"Oh, son! Let there not be fear for you of demons the terrible ones performing cruel deeds, of devilish beings called Pisachas and of all carnivorous animals."
"In that impenetrable forest occupied by you, let there be no monkeys, scorpions,
gad fies, mosquitoes, snakes or other insects ."
"Oh, son! Let the great elephants , lions with tusks, tigers, bears, terrible
he-buffaloes with horns not to be hostile to you.
"Oh, son! Let the other ferocious man-eaters belonging to animal-species, being
worshipped by me here, not hurt you."
"Oh, Rama, my son! May your path-ways be propitious ! Let your valour be powerful! Go well with all accomplishments!.
"Let there be security to you against those dwelling in the atmosphere and on the
earth as well as against all the celestials as also your enemies."
"Oh, Rama! May Venus and the moon as also the sun and Kubera (the god of wealth) and Yama (the god of death) who are being worshipped by me, protect you, while you reside in the forest of Dandaka"
"Oh, Rama! May sacred hymns coming forth from fire, air , vapour, and from the mouth of singer of sacred hymns protect you at the time of taking bath."
"Let Siva, the lord of all spheres, Brahma, the lord of creation, Vishnu, the
nourisher of beings, the sages and the rest of the celestials may protect you dwelling in the forest.
Uttering thus, the illustrious Kausalya having large eyes, worshipped troops of
divinities with garlands , sandal paste and befitting hymns of praise.
Duly procuring fire, she caused oblation to be poured into it, as per the direction of a high souled brahmana for the purpose of Rama's well- being .
Kausalya, the excellent woman procured clarified butter , white garlands, ceremonial sticks and white mustard seeds.
That preceptor performed ceremony for peace as per the statute as well as without
error and carried out propitiatory oblation externally with the remaining sacrificial food left after the main offering .
She then got brahmanas to pronounce blessings with honey, curd , unbroken grains of rice and clarified butter by the repetition of certain hymns and to utter prayers for the well - being of Rama in the forest.
The illustrious Kausalya gave the desired fee to that chief of brahmanas and spoke as follows to Rama:- "Which felicity occurred in Devendra the thousand- eyed, adored by all celestials when a demon called Vritta was destroyed, let that felicity occur to you"
"Which blessing was invoked by Vinata to Garuda who was setting off to bring nectar in the past , may that blessing happen to you."
"While blessing was bestowed on Devendra, the wielder of the thunderbolt , killing the demons at the time of producing nectar, let that blessing come to you "
"Oh, Rama! Which good fortune occurred to Vishnu who was immensely glorious while
making his three strides (in order to measure the three worlds), let that good fortune come to you
"Oh, Rama, the mighty armed! May the seasons , oceans , Dvipas (principal division of earth girdled by oceans ), vedas, various spheres and quarters confer blessings with good luck to you."
saying so, Kausalya, the large eyed proud woman placed some unbroken rice grains on her son's head, smeared varieties of sandal pastes over his body, fastened about his wrist by way of an amulet, a herb called Visalyakarani(so called because it helps in painlessly extracting an arrow stuck into one's body )which is efficacious and auspicious and muttered sacred hymns in order to enhance its virtue.
Though filled with grief inside, she appeared to be over-joyed outside and with
faltering words , spoke thus with only mouth and not with her heart.
The illusrious Kausalya embraced Rama, smelling his head by bending it and spoke
these words "Rama, my son! Go with ease with accomplishment of purpose, as you are."
Oh, son! With all your purposes fulfilled and with good health, I shall see you
returning to Ayodhya happily and taking over the reins of the kingdom
"All my thoughts of grief having been expulsed and my face shining with joy, I shall behold you returning from the forest like the full moon rising from the horizon"
"Oh, Rama! I shall behold you returning here from your sojourn in the forest, having fulfilled your father's word and installed on the splendid throne."
"Having come here from your sojourn in the forest, you will be familiar with
auspicious things and will ever be augmenting the desires of my daughter-in-law and of me. Depart now, Oh, Rama !"
"Oh, Rama! Worshipped by me, let the hosts of gods headed by Siva, the Supreme
Being, the great sages, spirits, the chief of evil spirits, the celestial serpents and the (four)quarters wish well of you, who is setting forth to forest, "
Having so said and having completed the rite of invoking blessings befittingly,
Kausalya whose eyes were overflowing with tears, further went clockwise around Rama and having pressed close to him, embraced again and again.
Having been done circumbulation (as a mark of protection) thus by the pious woman
Kausalya, that highly illustrious Rama pressing his mother's feet again and again , shining by his own splendour, went to Sita's house.When Rama, who is excellent in virtue and outstanding among those causing delight, having left for the forest, Kausalya who was feeling pained, spoke, weeping to her husband as follows:
"Despite the fame in the three worlds of your great glory that Dasaratha is
compassionate, bountiful and kind in his words, how your two sons along with Seetha who grew comfortably can bear suffering in the forest when faced with hardships, O the best among the foremost of men!"
"That Seetha, who is a young lady in the prime of her youth and very delicate, can really tolerate heat and cold?"
"How the large-eyed Seetha can eat a food prepared with wild rice, she having eaten here a good food containing soups and snacks?"
"How that irreproachable Seetha can hear the horrid sounds of cruel animals and
lions, after hearing the auspicious sounds of singing and music here?"
Where Rama the mighty hero, resplendent as Mahendra's standard and the mighty armed is sleeping indeed with his arm as a pillow?"
"When can I see the face of Rama with the colour of a lotus, framed with marvelous locks of lotus-perfume, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and excellent?"
There is no doubt that my heart is fully made of the solid-interior of a diamond,
for which reason this heart is not shattered into a thousand pieces, even in my not seeing of that Rama."
"It was not a kindly act by you that you banished my kith and kin, who were worthy of comforts to wander around in the forest in such a miserable condition."
"Even if Rama comes back in the fifteenth year, it cannot be inferred that Bharata will abandon the kingdom and the treasury."
"There are those who in a ceremony in hour of dead relatives, first feed their
relatives and thereafter, to fulfill their duty, remember to invite the illustrious Twice-born.
"The virtuous and the learned Brahmins, who are like unto gods, do not accept
afterwards even food as delicious as ambrosia."
"The best of Brahmins in their wisdom, will not accept what remains of the food of which other Brahmins have partaken, regarding it as a bull shorn of its horns."
"O, king! Why not the eldest and the best brother refuse to accept the kingdom
enjoyed by the younger brother?"
"A tiger does not wish to share a part of food eaten by another animal. In the same manner, Rama the tiger among men may not accept that which has been enjoyed by another."
"Oblations, clarified butter, leavings of an offering, sacred grass and sacrificial posts made of trunk of Khadira tree, once used, are not put to use again in a sacrifice."
"Thus, Rama cannot accept the kingdom taken away by other, as those not accepting an ambrosia whose essence has been taken away or as in a sacrifice, stalks of Soma plant (from which a beverage called Soma is prepared) are lost."
"Rama will not go through such a type of dishonour, as a strong tiger does not
endure even touching of its tail."
"Even if all the worlds combine together in a great battle, they cannot stir up fear in him. The virtuous minded Rama will provide righteousness to the people with unrighteousness."
"Rama with great prowess and with his mighty arms can surely burn up all beings and even the ocean itself by his golden arrows; like at the time of destruction of the world."
"That excellent man with such a lion's strength and with eyes like those of a bull was ruined indeed by his own father, like killing its child-fish by an adult fish."
"A son, who is devoted to righteousness, has been sent to exile by you. Is it a
right thing for you, as seen by scriptures or is it an eternal conduct as practiced by the Twice born?"
"O, king! A husband is a chief refuge for a woman. Her second refuge is a son. The third refuge is her near-relative. There is no fourth one here."
"Among those three refuges, you do not indeed exist. Rama on his part took refuge in a forest and I do not wish to go there. Thus, I have been ruined in all ways, by you."
"This kingdom along with neighboring states has been ruined by you. You yourself
along with ministers have been ruined. I along with my son are ruined. Citizens too are ruined. Your son Bharata and your wife Kaikeyi only are delighted."
Hearing the aforesaid voice of Kausalya, consisting of her cruel words, the king
also being distressed, became disillusioned. Thereafter, the king then looking back on his own evil act, was entangled in griefSeeing the aforesaid deceased king, who looked like a fully extinguished fire, a
waterless ocean and a lusterless sun, Kausalya holding the king's head on her lap with her eyes full of tears and who was stricken with grief of various sorts, spoke to Kausalya as follows:
"O Kaikeyi the cruel one and the doer of evils! You be there, having fulfilled your desires. Deserting the king, you can enjoy the kingdom undisturbed and without any hindrance.
"Rama has left me and gone to the forest. My husband too has left for heaven. I do not wish to live, as one left behind by a caravan in a wrong road."
"Which woman would wish to survive, leaving her husband who was divine, except
Kaikeyi who kicked off righteousness?"
"A greedy person cannot understand one's faults, like one who eats a forbidden dish. Due to that hump- backed woman, Kaikeyi has ruined the race of Raghu dynasty."
"Hearing Rama along with his wife have been sent to exile by the king as he was
coerced as he was (Kaikeyi) to do an unworthy act, Janaka will profusely lament as I do."
"Rama the pious man who is possessed of like lotus leaves, and who has disappeared from here even though living, now does not know me to have because a support -less widow.
"Even so, Sita, the daughter of king of Videha, the pitiable lady and who is
unworthy of lamentation, will get frightened with grief in the forest.
"Greatly alarmed to hear the fearful cries of wild animals and birds making their
noises in nights, surely she will cling herself to Rama.
"Janaka too who is aged, and who is not having sons, will be thinking of Sita, over whelmed with grief and will surely abandon his life.
"Today itself, I too in devotion to my husband, will meet my appointed end. I shallenter the fire, duly embracing this body of my husband.
The chamberlains reverently removed from that place that unfortunate Kausalya, who was in excess of her grief and was closely embracing her dead husband.
The ministers assigned for the job kept the king in an oil trough and did all the
acts that were to be done therafter.
The ministers who were knowing all such matters were not willing to do cremation for the king in the absence of his sons and that is why preserved the king's body .(in an oil through).
Seeing that the king was laid down in an oil through by the ministers those women in the gynaacium cried "Alas! He is dead!"
Crying their faces with eyes flowing with tears, the miserable women through up
their arms, stricken with grief as they were and pitiably lamented as follows:
"Alas! Great king! When we are already deprived of Rama who speaks lovingly and who always keeps up his promise, why have you left us?"
"Far in distance from Rama, how shall we without our husband, live in proximity to Kaikeyi of wretched nature, who killed her husband?
"Rama, a protector to you and all of us as well as a capable, prudent and an eminent man, has indeed gone on exile to the forest, leaving this lovely kingdom.
"How can we, being disgraced by Kaikeyi, and stupefied by evil passion, live without you and the heroic Rama."
"Whom else will Kaikeyi by whom have been abandoned the king as well as Rama along with Lakshmana great strength and Sita- not abandon?
"With tears and excessive agony, those excellent Dasaratha's wives together in a
row, rolled on the ground, sorrowful as they were."
The city of Ayodhya, bereft of the high-soled king Dasaratha, was splendour-less, as a night without moon and as awoman without husband.
With people disturbed with tears, with virtuous women raising cries of distress and with its cross -roads and entrances of houses looking desolate, the city of Ayodhya did not shine as before.
While the king has gone to heaven due to grief and while the king's wives were lying on the ground , the sun suddenly went away retreating its movement. The night approached, with its darkness having proceeded to spread throughout.
The friends and relatives who came there, did not like the king's cremation in the absence of his sons. Thus thinking, they kept the king of inconceivable sight in that resting place(oil- trough) 
Deserted by the high-soled Dasaratha, with its roads and cross roads filled with
people choked with tears in their throats, the city of Ayodhya, looking like sky without sun and night with its multitude of stars disappeared, did not shine with its light having gone away.
After the king's death, men and women in the city converged in groups, abusing
Bharata's mother, became disturbed and did not obtain happiness.While Rama, the best of men was leaving, after offering salutation to his father,
women in the palace were weaping loudly.
Which Rama, without being told by his father, used to do necessary activities and
protect the entire palace, is about to go to exile now".
"Rama, since he was born, was showing the same attention to us, as he was showing to his mother Kausalya."
"He used to avoid actions which created anger and soothed all those who were angry.
Rama was not furious with those who abused him. Such Rama is going today to exile."
"Our stupid king by abandoning Rama who was helpful to all beings , is offending all the beings."
Thus, all the king consorts while weaping loudly, as cows which lost their Calves, abused their husband .
After hearing the terrific distressful crying sounds in the palace, Dasaratha clung to the seat, with extreme anguish for his son.
Rama, who was greatly hurt, sighed like an elephant, subdued his senses and went to his mother's palace along with Lakshmana.
Rama saw a much worshipped old man sitting at the gateway of the house and many
other standing there.
After seeing Rama, all of them rose quickly and greeted Rama the most triumphant
man, by uttering the words "May you have increased success!"
Rama crossed the first gate and saw old Brahmanas who were perfect in Vedas and duly honoured by the king.
Rama offered salutation to those brahmanas and saw old women and girls, guarding the gate in the third enclosure.
Then those women, having been delighted, greeted Rama with good word of success,
quickly entered the house and informed Kausalya about the lovely arrival of Rama .
At that time, Kausalya having spent the whole night with steadfastness, who
performing worship to Vishnu,at dawn, for the welfare of her son.
Kausalya, who was interested to practise religious vows regularly was appearing
auspiciously by wearing a white silk sari and gladly performing sacrificial ceremony in a sacred fire, by reciting vedic hymns.
Then Rama entered the auspicious mother's apartment and saw his mother performing
sacrificial ceremony in sacred fire there.
There, Rama saw the articles of worship kept ready for the purpose of the sacred
ceremony like curd, unbroken rice, clarified butter, sweet meats, things fit for oblation, fried grain, garlands made of white flowers, rice boiled in milk, mixture of rice and peas with a few spices, sacrificial sticks, vessels full of water etc.
Kausalya, who became lean because of observance of vows, was shining like an angel with her white silk sari and was satiating gods by presenting to them libations by water.
By seeing her son who came after a long time and who gave delight to mother,
Kausalya was pleased and approached towards him, like a female horse approaching her young colt.
Rama offered salutation to the approaching mother by touching her feet. Then, she
took him into her arms and smelt his head.
Kausalya spoke these pleasing words affectionately to her son Rama, who was
unassailable by enemies.
"Obtain long life and glory, as obtained by the aged , the virtuous, the great
souled and the royal sages .Protect the righteousness engrained in your race"
"Oh,Rama ! King Dasaratha ,your father is a man of true promise. Today itself, you will be installed as successor to the kingdom by your virtuous father."
Kausalya asked Rama to take food , but Rama just touched the seat offered by her and after performing salutation to her, spoke thus to his mother.
That Rama , being humble in nature , became still modest due to respect for his
mother and was set about to ask her permission before setting forth his journey to Dandaka forest.
"Oh,mother! You do not know that a great dismay is approaching now. It brings grief to you, to Sita and to Lakshmana"
"I am going to Dandaka forest. Why this seat for me? Time has come for me to sit on a seat made of Kusha grass."
"I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, leaving off meat and living with roots, fruits and honey".
"The great king is giving to Bharata the succession to kingdom and to me, however, he is making me a sage to stay in the forest of Dandaka."
"I have to satisfy with the things existing in the forest and subsist with roots and fruits in a solitary forest for fourteen years."
The queen Kausalya fell on the floor all at once like the branch of a tree, cut down by an axe and as an angel dropping down from heaven.
Seeing Kausalya who was fit to be free from sorrow, Rama lifted up her, who had
fallen unconsciously on the floor like a plantain tree.
Rama touched with his hand that miserable Kausalya,whose limbs were covered with
fragrant powder and who rose like a loaded horse from the floor on which it rolled from side to side.
Kausalya, who was fit for happiness but was afflicted with grief, spoke thus to Rama the best of men who was sitting nearby, while Lakshmana was hearing.
"Oh, Rama! I would not have felt this much grief if I were childless .You are born only to produce sorrow to me."
"Oh, son! There is no other grief to a barren woman except the only worry that "I
have no sons".
"Oh, Rama! I have not seen any happiness or prosperity earlier, while my husband is in power. I believed that I could see them at last when my son comes to power."
"I have to hear so many disagreeable words from my fellow-wives who are inferior to me and who pierce my heart with their words though I am a better and virtuous wife among them."
"Which one will be more sorrowful to women than this unending and consuming grief
that occurred to me now?"
"Even when you are near by, I am being rejected. What to tell after you leave for
exile? Death indeed is certain to me."
"My husband always held me down, without giving me any independence and treat me
equal to or even lower than the servants of Kaikeyi"
Those who serve me now and those who follow me, will not speak to me, after seeing Bharata".
Oh, son! How can I, the miserable one, see the face of Kaikeyi who talks hurtingly because of her continuous anger."
"Oh,Rama! I have been waiting for seventeen years after your second birth of thread ceremony, with the hope that my troubles will disappear at one time or the other."
Oh, Rama! In this old age, I cannot bear insult from co-wives and this unending
sorrow for a long time.
"How can I the pitiable one, spend this miserable life without seeing your face
radiating like full moon."
"You were nourished in vain by me ,the important one by fasts, by meditations, by
various difficult and painful vows ."
"My heart is not breached, as bank of a great river, struck by new water in monsoon, by hearing this news.That is why, I feel it is strong."
"There is no death to me, indeed .I have no place in the abode of god yama who
presides over the spirits of the dead .That is why, Yama is not forcingly carrying me off like a lion carrying off a wailing antelope."
"This grief is inserted into my body. Even then, my heart is stable. It has not
broken into pieces and fallen on the floor .It is indeed made of iron. There is no untimely death, it is certain"
"I feel bad since all my religious vows, charities, restraints have all gone
waste.The austerity I performed for the sake of of -spring has gone in vain, as a seed sown in a saline soil."
"If a man in great distress can get premature death out of his own will, I being
separated from you ,would have attain the glory of the dead now itself like cow without the calf."
"Moreover, what is the use of life? Oh, Rama! With your brilliant face shining like moon! My life is useless without you. I shall accompany you to the forest like a weak cow going behind it's calf"
Then, that Kausalya looked at Rama to whom a great calamity has occurred, saw her
son bound by grief and lamented very much in various ways like a kinnara woman.Witnessing that thrilling converse between those two brothers with incomparable
dignity, the great sages gathered there were astonished.
The assemblies of ascetics, great saints present there and the distinguished sages who stood invisible in space, applauded both Rama and Bharata, the magnanimous brothers, saying (as follows):
"That Dasaratha, who begot these two sons, who know righteousness and whose strength is justice, was fortunate. By hearing the debate between these two princes, we are indeed delighted."
Thereafter, that assembly of sages, who wished to see a quick destruction of Ravana, came together and spoke the following words to Bharata, the excellent king.
"O Bharata born in a noble race, highly intelligent, having a superior conduct and a great repute! If you have regard for your father, Rama's words are to be accepted.
"We wish to see Rama absolved of all obligations forever to his father. Dasaratha, having honoured his pledge to Kaikeyi, indeed went to heaven."
Having uttered that much, all the celestial musicians and the great sages then went to their respective abodes.
Hearing those auspicious words, the good-looking Rama looked radiant and worshipped those sages with a joyful countenance.
Bharata, on his part, with trembled limbs, joined his palms in salutation and again spoke the following words to Rama in a strangled voice:
"O, Rama! Keep in view the continuance of our royal statue and the statute of the
race. You ought to yield to the entreaties of mine and those of your mother."
"I am not able to rule this vast empire alone to the satisfaction of the beloved
inhabitants of town and country!"
"Our kith and king, soldiers, companions and allies are waiting for you indeed, as farmers wait for the rainy clouds."
"O, the sagacious Rama! Return to the kingdom and keep it in order. You have the
competence to save the world!"
That Bharata, who was kind-spoken, thus made a fervent appeal to Rama and fell at
his feet.
Placing on his lap, that Bharata of dark hue, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and having a voice like that of a swan in rut, Rama spoke the following words to him:
"O, my dear brother! You are very much competent to rule the earth, by the intellect you obtained both inherently and by training."
"Take counsel with your ministers, companions and intelligent counsellors and get
all activities done, even if they are gigantic."
"Light may go off from the moon; Himalayan mountain may shake off its snows; the sea may transgress its shores, but I will never be false to my father's vow!"
"My dear brother! Your mother acted thus, for your sake, out of her affection or
ambition. It should not be carried out in your mind. You ought to obey her as your mother."
Bharata replied (as follows) to Rama, who was speaking as aforesaid and who was
equal to sun by his splendour or to the moon in its first quarter.
"O, noble brother! Pray mount with your feet on the wooden sandals adorned with
gold! Surely, these will bestow, gain and security to all the people!"
Rama, the tiger among men, possessing exceptional glory, placing his feet on the
sandals and leaving them, gave them to the magnanimous Bharata.
Bowing before the sandals, Bharata spoke the following words to Rama: "O, Rama the hero and the tormentator of enemies! For fourteen years, I shall wear matted locks and robes of bark, live on fruits and roots O Rama, and live outside the city, offering the ruling of the kingdom to your sandals."
"O, Rama! If I do not see you the following day when the fourteenth year has fully ended, I shall enter the fire once for all."
"So be it" promised Rama, embraced that Bharata with affection, took Shatrughna also in his arms and spoke to Bharata as follows:
"O Bharata! Protect your mother, Kaikeyi. Do not get angry with her. You are taken vow thus by me and by Seetha." speaking thus, Rama with his eyes filled iwth tears, bade farewell to his brother.
The valiant Bharata, who knew righteousness worshipped those sandals which were
well-decorated made a circumambulation to Rama and kept the sandals on the head of an excellent elephant.
Rama, the augmentator of Raghu dynasty, being firm as a Himalayan rock in abiding in his own righteousness, greeted those men, in accord with their rank, the host of his preceptors, ministers, subjects and his brothers and bade farewell to all of them.
His mothers, their voices choked with tears due to sorrow, were unable to bid
farewell verbally to Rama. However, Rama himself offered his salutations to all his mothers and entered his hermitage, weeping.A massy and tumultuous ass-coloured cloud rained ill-omened bloody water while that fiendish force is 
advancing. 
The highly speedy horses paired to Khara's chariot have tottered in a trice, even though that place 
on the highway is with even surface and spread with flowers. 
Capturing the sun a blackish corona with blood-red outer circle has formed and nested around it 
like the fiery ring formed by circling a fireball. 
Then, nearing the golden shaft of the flag of the chariot with a very lofty flagstaff, an awful eagle 
with massive body occupied and perched atop of that golden shaft. 
Cacophonous and carnivorous predators and vultures took over the nearby places of Janasthaana and they 
made raucous sounds of many kinds. 
Turning towards the stretch scorched by the sun, fearsome and loud noised jackals have howled emitting 
awful sounds, that which is inauspicious to the demons. 
Then frightening clouds similar to bursting mountains carrying bloodlike water have rendered the firmament 
less of leeway. 
There chanced an abominable, cataclysmic, hair-raising darkness whereby the milieus or inter-milieus 
are not very clearly brightened. 
An untimely eventide glistened with a colour similar to the one drenched in blood, and then horrendous 
brutes and birds have clamoured facing Khara directly, and the vultures, jackals and eagles too have 
screamed portending danger. 
Jackals, that too female jackals, are always the agents of inauspiciousness in wars with demonstrable 
calamities brought forth by their portending howling, and such jackals have now howled in front of Khara's 
army with their snouts spewing blazes. 
A spherical object like that of a human trunk is revealed near at the sun, while the sun is rendered 
shineless as though Rahu, the great eclipsing-planet, has eclipsed him inopportunely, and the wind too 
whirled frantically. 
Stars sprang up with the brilliance of fireflies though it is not night, and at that moment fishes and 
waterfowls stood still in lakes, lotuses have dried up, flowers and fruits have dropped from trees as 
though it is night. 
Without any puffing of wind dust in brownish-red colour is heaved up, and there the songbirds like Maina 
started to twitter as 'cii cii kuu cii'. 
Meteors horrible in their look have fallen down thunderously, and even the earth together with its mountains, 
woods and forests quaked shakily. 
He who is raving while sitting in his chariot that clever Khara's left shoulder thrilled excessively, 
and his voice too quavered. 
While he is seeing everywhere his eyes spawned tears for no good reason, his forehead ached, but he 
did not retrace his steps owing to his own vanity. 
On observing those worst auguries stemming up at that moment with hair-raising nature, Khara laughed 
them off and said this to all of the demons. 
"These awful auguries with their horrible nature have arisen, but owing to my own valour I am unbothered 
about all of them as with a mighty one unworried of the mightless. 
"With the excruciating arrows of mine I can hurtle stars from the face of sky, and if highly infuriated, 
I can even enjoin mortality to Death himself. 
"I am reluctant to return without killing that Rama, a haughty one by his might, together with his brother 
Lakshmana, with my incisive arrows. 
"In whose respect both Rama and Lakshmana behaved perversely, let that sister of mine be contented in 
drinking the blood of those two. 
"No defeat has chanced on me in combats at anytime and anywhere, that to you all is obvious and I tell 
no untruth. 
"If I am infuriated I can eliminate even the king of gods, wielder of Thunderbolt and a trekker on ruttish 
elephant Iravata, namely Indra in a war, then why talk about these two humans." Thus Khara addressed 
his troops. 
On hearing that thundering speech of Khara that sizeable army of demons which is tied down by the noose 
of death obtained an incomparable rejoice. 
Then desiring to see the war of Khara with Rama, great-souls like sages, gods, gandharva-s along with 
carana-s and siddha-s have come together in firmament. 
On gathering at a place those great souls met one another and said, "let good betide cows, Brahmans 
and those that are held respectful by the people at large." 
"Let Raghava triumph over these mighty night walkers from the lineage of Pulastya, as with Vishnu who 
once conquered all the mighty demons in war." So said celestials to one another. 
While the great sages are speaking about this and many other topics, they and the gods abiding in their 
aircrafts have inquisitively seen the flow of army of demons, whose longevity is now beyond hope. 
Khara speedily bolted in his chariot to the van of his legions, and on seeing that demon Khara going 
in front other important demons too rushed to fore. They are Shyenagaami, Prithugviira, Yajnashatru, 
Vihamgama and also Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, 
Rudhiraaksha. These twelve highly valorous demons cruised in a semicircle around Khara. 
Likewsie Mahakapaala, Stuulaaksha, Pramaathii, Trishira are the four commanders of demonic forces and 
they followed Duushana marching at his behind. 
That army of valiant demons which is highly execrable, infernally speedy, and readily inspirited for 
a battle quickly rushed towards those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, as though a festoon of planets 
would rush towards the Moon and Sun so as to put them to rout. Thus when Shuurpanakha disparaged that valiant Khara amidst demons he is infuriated and spoke these 
highly hurtful words. 
"This fury of mine originating from the disgrace brought on you is like the highly bitter salt water 
that is impossible to contain when ingested. 
"I do not care the valour of that Rama for he is a human with dwindled lifetime, now going to give up 
his life slain by his own misdoings. 
"Control your tears and cast off your despair too, for I will send Rama to the abode of the Terminator 
along with his brother. 
"Now, you demoness, you will swill that Rama's red hot blood when that short-lived one is hewed down 
to earth with an axe." So Khara assured Shuurpanakha. 
On hearing the words plunged from the mouth of Khara she is very much gladdened and in all her stupidity 
she further praised her brother highly saying, "you are the best among all the demons..." 
Though she denounced him earlier she alone praised him now for which Khara is overjoyed, and then he 
ordered his army commander, namely Duushana. 
"Those who are the followers of my will, whose hustle will be frightful and who will be unretreating 
in combats, such of those demons are there in fourteen thousand numbers, aren't they. 
"And oh, gentle Duushana, those domineering demons are with dark-clouds like complexions, and they are 
the pamperers of genocide, as such, cause them for a belligerency, all at once. 
"For me, oh, gentle one, promptly position my chariot before me along with bows and arrows, amazing 
swords and diverse sharp power bolts. 
"Oh, war pert Duushana, I wish to start ahead of all the demons of ours, who are the clans-demons of 
the great souled Paulastya, for the purpose of elimination of that evil-minded Rama." So said Khara 
to Duushana. 
While Khara is saying thus Duushana heralded saying, "Here comes the great chariot with sun's dazzle, 
yoked with very good horses of variegated colours." 
That chariot which has a roomy cabin with its rooftop like that of the ridge of Mt. Meru, body embellished 
in gold, wheels golden, gem-studded yoke-to-carriage shaft, all around encompassed with golden artefacts 
like fishes, flowers, trees, mountains, sun, moon, and auspicious birds flocks and stars, and even decorated 
with jingle-bells, endowed with flags, swords, and best horses, and such as it is, Khara embarked on 
it with all his rancour. 
On overseeing that great army with chariots, skins shields, weaponry and flags, and even at Duushana 
too, Khara charged all those demons saying "proceed." 
Then that demonic force with their ghoulish skin shields, weaponry and flags, issued forth from Janasthaana, 
blaring blatantly and foraying dashingly. 
Wielding maces, dart-bolts, and spears, and also razor-sharp axes, swords and discs, and dreadful power-darts 
and power-bolts that are flashing, iron maces, unusual bows, clubs, scimitars and pounding-shafts, and 
even thunderbolt like weapons that are calamitous in look, that army which comprises fourteen thousand 
fiendish demons that are the followers of Khara's whim, has started from Janasthaana. 
On seeing the outrush of those demons of diabolic appearance, then Khara's chariot also proceeded a 
little later at their behind. 
Then the charioteer set spurs on those colourful horses that are adorned in polished gold according 
to the notions of Khara. 
When the chariot of enemy destroyer Khara is driven that impetuously, it has started to swell earth's 
four cardinal quarters and inter-quarters with turbulence. 
He whose voice is thunderous and whose rancour escalated speedily, and who is hastening forward like 
the Terminator intending to destroy his enemy, that Khara repeatedly hurried the charioteer shouting 
at him loudly like a overwhelming cloud that is going to storm stones. Rama, the great-resplendent, spoke these words forbiddingly albeit softly to Khara who lost his chariot 
but staying his course wielding a mace. 
"Although you hold sway over a gigantic force abounding with elephants horses and chariots, you have 
perpetrated heinous deeds in Dandaka forests that are loathsome to all the worlds, that is unseemliest 
to this soldiery. 
"One who causes suffering to living beings, besides being a transgressor and completely ruthless, he 
does not stand up for himself even if he were to be the lord of all the three worlds. 
"All people will eliminate him, oh, nightwalker, who is imperious and an infringer of worldly routine, 
as they would eradicate a vicious serpent, in the event of its running across them. 
"He who goes on performing evils selfishly, obsessively, heedlessly, more so delightedly, he will see 
the results of his own doings, like red-tailed-lizard on its eating self-destructive hailstones, obsessively 
and delightedly. 
"The residents of Dandaka forest are the highly-propitious sages that tread the path of virtue, and 
oh, demon, what benefit you gain in killing them, really? 
"Even if a fortune is made for a lavish living with an iota of merit, the evildoers, that too reprobates, 
further more those that are abominated by world will not last long, no more that petrified tree trunks. 

"One who undertakes evildoings will definitely and seasonably reap their fruits, which in his case will 
be ghoulish, as with the flowering of trees according to season. 
"In the world one acquires the fruit of profane acts not before long, oh, nightwalker, and it will be 
like venomous food devoured. 
"I am the king who arrived to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even 
of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world.
"I am the one who arrived at the behest of the king Dasharatha, or Bharata to exterminate the lives 
of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation 
of world. 
"Now, my arrows that are decorated in gold will be released on you like snakes rebounding from a snake-pit, 
and they will tear you asunder, and on riving you they will bounce back into my quivers. 
"Now eliminated in war, you along with your army will tread behind those sages that were treading the 
path of virtue, on whom you have so far feasted in Dandaka forest. 
"Let the supreme sages who were earlier slain by you may now see abiding on their aircrafts, your abidance 
in hellish death pangs when assaulted with my arrows. 
"Attack me as you wish... make an effort... you the knave of your clan... now I am going to toss your 
head down like a palm-fruit..." Thus Rama addressed Khara. 
But when Rama said thus, Khara is infuriated and convulsed in anger, and he replied Rama with bloodshot 
eyes, laughing boisterously. 
"On killing average demons in war, oh, son of Dasharatha, how you praise yourself when you yourself 
are un-praiseworthy?" Thus Khara started to speak to Rama. 
"Those best of men that are victorious and mighty will not boast anything, for they will be really proud 
of their own valour. 
"Oh, Rama, as to how undignified Kshatriya-s that are frivolous and irresolute in self-confidence will 
boast in the world, likewise you too are boasting in a meaningless manner. 
"Who will be that valiant that speaks about his lineage at wartime, that too, when the death-time is 
looming large! And, there will there be someone who broaches his self-extols in such an inopportune 
situation, is it! 
"Howsoever your ignominy is well shown by your self-praise, like the manifestation of gold on the tip 
of grass-blade burnt by fire, where the fire on grass-blade is no fire, and the bulb of fire appearing 
at the tip of grass-blade as a bulb of gold, is no gold. 
"But you are seeing me wielding a mace and standing before you like an unshakable and jagged mountain 
laden with ores, isn't it! 
"As to how the Terminator wielding noose is enough to take away all the lives in all the three worlds, 
handling my mace I am enough for detracting your life from you. 
"Even though much is to be said in your respect I will not continue to say, for the sun is getting at 
the dusk thereby disruption to war occurs. 
"You have killed fourteen thousand demons and on killing you I will wipe the tears of the wives of those 
dead demons today itself." Khara said so to Rama. 
Saying thus that highly infuriated Khara hurled his mace towards Rama, around which there are superb 
golden cinctures, and which is extremely glaring like a thunderbolt. 
Forcefully discharged from Khara's hands that highly fiery and stupendous mace rendering trees and shrubs 
down to ashes darted towards Rama. 
When that monstrous mace similar to the halter of the Terminator is swooping down, Rama smashed it to 
smithereens with his arrows while it is still sky rocketing. 
That mace splintered with arrows of Rama fell crumbling onto the surface of earth as a springing female 
snake would fall down by the strength of spells and nostrums. Khara is intimidated on seeing the elimination of Duushana along with Trishira inasmuch as the intrepidity 
of Rama is concerned. 
On seeing the annihilation of the insufferable and mighty force of demons, even that of Duushana and 
Trishira by lone Rama, and thus to apprehend that the demonic force is wholly destructed, that demon 
Khara became apprehensive, and then he lunged at Rama, as with demon Namuchi who once lunged at Indra. 

Forcefully drawing the bowstring fitted with iron-arrows, which looked like furious serpents of venom 
ingesting only blood, Khara discharged them on Rama. 
Fidgeting with bowstring in many a way, brandishing missiles with many a skill, Khara moved about the 
battleground in many a manner, seated on chariot and showing his expertise with arrows. 
That great chariot-fighter Khara then started to fill all the stretches and inter-stretches with arrows, 
seeing that even Rama reciprocally started to take aim with his bow Rama, and then filled and made the 
sky less of leeway with verily unendurable arrows that are like tongues of fire emitting sparks, as 
with Rain-god chocking the sky with torrents, less of latitude. 
No empty space is left out in the space around since it has become riotous with the sharp arrows discharged 
by Rama and Khara from everywhere. 
While both of them are warring with excitement to slay one another, then the sun obscured with the mesh 
of arrows has not shined. 
Then with acutely edged tubular, iron, and crescent-edged arrows Khara swatted Rama in that combat, 
as a great elephant will be swatted with a goad. 
When charioted Khara came to the presence of Rama with bow in hand and ready for a close combat, that 
demon appeared to all beings as the Terminator handling his noose. 
Khara presumed that greatly indefatigable Rama is wholly fatigued by now, though he has shown his mettle 
of boldness in eliminating all of the demonic forces, all the while. 
On seeing Khara who is prancing like a lion with a gait of a lion, Rama is unruffled like a lion that 
sees a least beast. 
In a chariot that equals the sun in its radiance then Khara reached Rama as a moth reaches fire. 
Showing sleight of hand Khara then broke the handgrip of the bow of that great-souled Rama along with 
an arrow fitted on it. 
Still infuriated Khara has drawn seven more arrows that equal the radiance of Indra's thunderbolts and 
hit Rama's armour in that war. 
Then, on distressing Rama of unequalled vitality with a thousand arrows in that combat Khara blared 
a loud blare. 
With the arrows released by Khara that have a great egress, then that armour of Rama that has a sun-like 
resplendence is completely destroyed and fell on the field. 
When all his limbs are hit with arrows Rama is enraged and in that war Rama flared up like a fumeless 
flaring fire. 
Then Rama, the blaster of enemies, strung bowstring to another thunderously blasting bow, to end the 
enemy. 
That which is a very admirable bow of Vishnu and that which is awarded by great-sage Agastya, upraising 
that choicest bow Rama rushed towards Khara. 
With arrows that have golden fins and curved barbs that highly infuriated Rama then fragmented Khara's 
flagstaff with flag in that war. 
That eye-pleasing golden flagstaff with flag is severally shattered and fell onto ground as if it is 
god-damned sun fallen on earth. 
By that Khara is enraged, and as one who is aware of striking crucial parts/war tactics assaulted on 
the chest of Rama with four arrows, and even on other limbs, as one would prod an elephant with lancets. 

Impacted with various arrows unloosened from the bow of Khara, limbs of Rama are drenched in blood and 
he became highly indignant. 
On aiming his great bow that ablest one among archers, namely Rama, then in that war released six arrows 
targeting pointedly. 
Rama indeed hit Khara's head with one arrow, with two his hands, and next with three crescent shaped 
arrows he hit his chest. 
Then afterwards that great-resplendent Rama wishing to eliminate the demon, infuriately launched 
thirteen iron arrows that are sharply whetted and similar to the dazzle of sun. 
That mighty Raghava who equals Indra in combats, smiling at the warfare of Khara, smashed the yoke of 
the chariot with one arrow; with four, four of the dappled horses; with the sixth, the head of the charioteer 
of Khara; with three, the three-pronged shaft from yoke to the base of chariot; with two the axels, 
thus that chariot is fragmented. Then, on wrecking Khara's bow on which an arrow is placed with the 
twelfth, that mighty one Rama impaled Khara with the thirteenth arrow that is similar to a thunderbolt. 

With his bow utterly shattered, chariot fragmented, horses killed, and charioteer felled, that Khara 
then hopped down to ground from the dilapidated chariot wielding a mace, and stood fast. 
The gods as well as great-sages have then came together and assembled in heavens, and those assemblies 
that are aboard their aircrafts are highly gladdened at the exploit of the great chariot-fighter Rama, 
and they worshipped him with their adjoined palms. "When King Sagara passed away owing to the irrefutable virtue of Time, 
			the ministers and subjects of that kingdom are predisposed towards the 
			highly honourable Amshuman to become their king and they enthroned him 
			accordingly." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration about the predecessors 
			of Rama. 
"He that Amshuman turned out to be a very great king, and oh, Rama of 
			Raghu's delight, he begot a marvellous son who is renowned as Dileepa. 
			
Assigning the kingdom to Dileepa, oh, Rama of Raghu's dynasty, Amshuman 
			undertook very stern ascesis on a pleasant peak of Himalayas desiring 
			the descent of River Ganga to earth. 
On practising ascesis in ascetic-woods for thirty-two thousand years 
			that highly renowned king Amshuman achieved heaven as he acquired only 
			the wealth of practising the ascesis. 
The great resplendent Dileepa on hearing the elimination of his grandfathers, 
			the sixty thousand sons of Sagara at the hand of sage Kapila, and with 
			a mind that is marred by the plight of his father Amshuman in absolving 
			the souls of Sagara's sons, he that Dileepa could not arrive at any 
			decision concerning the descent of Ganga. 
Dileepa became worried as to how River Ganga is to be alighted onto 
			earth from heaven, how water-oblations are to be offered for the souls 
			of Sagara's sons, and how to cross them, the souls, over this mortal 
			world. 
To him who is self-mortified and who is always thinking righteously 
			about the alight of Ganga onto earth, to such a Dileepa a most-virtuous 
			son is born who is renowned by his name Bhageeratha. 
That great-resplendent king Dileepa on his part performed numerous 
			Vedic-rituals, and he ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years - 
			to the delight of each of his subjects, but could not find a way to 
			fetch Ganga. 
Oh, tigerly-man Rama, that king Dileepa by not attaining any choice 
			towards the uplifting the souls of his grandparents to heaven by bringing 
			Ganga to earth, he took to illness, and he attained the ultimate virtue 
			of Time, namely the demise. 
That best one among men, namely king Dileepa, on anointing his son 
			Bhageeratha in the kingdom went to the abode of Indra, namely the heaven, 
			only by his self-acquired merits of deeds. 
Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, but on his part that self-righteous 
			and kingly-sage Bhageeratha is childless, and that great king longed-for 
			offspring. 
Interested in the alighting of River Ganga on earth, oh, Rama, the 
			descendent of Raghu, king Bhageeratha delegated his kingdom to the custody 
			of his ministers and people and firmed up himself in sustained asceticism 
			on Mt. Gokarna in Himalayas, and he practise ascesis standing amid five-fires, 
			upraising his hands, with a monthly sustenance and with his sense conquered. 
			
Thousands of years have rolled by while Bhageeratha stood practising 
			his severe ascesis, oh, dextrous Rama, and then the lord and master 
			of all beings, namely god Brahma, is well pleased with that great-souled 
			king's ascesis. 
Forefather Brahma then arrived along with assemblages of gods, and 
			spoke this way to the great-souled Bhageeratha who is deep in the practise 
			of ascesis. 
Oh, great king Bhageeratha, oh, lord of the people, I am delighted 
			with the perfectly conducted ascesis of yours, hence oh, truly committed 
			one, you may beseech for a boon. 
That great resplendent and highly fortunate king Bhageeratha then remaining 
			with suppliantly adjoined palm fold spoke to him who is the Forefather 
			of all worlds, namely Brahma. 
Oh, god, if you are satisfied with my ascesis, and if there is any 
			fruition to the ascesis of mine, let all the sons of Sagara get water 
			oblations through me. 
While the ashes of these great souls are drenched with the waters 
			of Ganga, let all of those great-grandfathers of mine depart to heaven, 
			eternally. 
Oh, god, I indeed pray for offspring in our Ikshvaku dynasty, let 
			not our dynasty dwindle as I am issueless, and oh, god, let this be 
			the other boon to me. 
The Forefather of all the worlds, Brahma, then replied the king who 
			has spoken in that way, in an auspicious tongue that is sweet-sounding 
			and sweetly worded, as well. 
Oh, top-speeded chariot-rider Bhageeratha, this aspiration of yours 
			is sublime, and oh, the furtherer of Ikshvaku dynasty, so be it, let 
			safeness betide you. 
This Ganga is the one with snow-broth, the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			and oh, king Bhageeratha, god Shiva alone is capable to sustain her 
			force in the course of her alighting onto earth, and in fact, he is 
			to be commissioned for that purpose. 
'Oh, king Bhageeratha, the earth cannot endure the downfall of Ganga 
			and to sustain Ganga, oh, king, indeed I do not behold none other than 
			the Trident-wielder, god Shiva.' Thus Brahma spoke to Bhageeratha. 
"Speaking this way to the king Bhageeratha and informally greeting Ganga 
			also, that Creator of Worlds, Brahma, left for heaven along with all 
			the groups of gods and Wind-gods." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration 
			about the arrival of River Ganga to earth. When harsh words with anger in this manner by the grief-stricken Kausalya, Rama's
mother were heard, king Dasaratha felt depressed and reflected upon them.
The king fell brooding thus perplexed as he was in his mind and lost his
consciousness. Thereafter, that king who torments the enemies regained his consciousness after a long time.
After restoring his consciousness he, breathing a long and hot sigh and seeing
Kausalya by his side, began to worry again.
As he thus brooded over, he recalled in his mind, a sinful deed that was done by him out of ignorance long ago, by shooting with an arrow an unseen object, the sound of which was only heard.
The mighty emperor felt distressed through agony caused by that sinful dead and as also through agony caused by separation from Rama and was tormented by the dual grief.
That king, tormented by the afflictions, was trembling, bent his head down, joined his palms in salutation, desirous of getting her grace and spoke to Kausalya as follows: "O, Kausalya! I seek your grace. This joining of palms is set out by me. You are always affectionate even towards others and even indeed kind."
"O, queen! For women reflecting on righteousness, a husband whether he is virtuous or worthless, is a visible god indeed."
"You as such, who is ever intent on virtue, who has understood good and evil
fortunes in the world, even if grief-stricken, ought not to have spoken unpleasant words to me, who is too much in distress."
Hearing those miserable words spoken by the distressed king, Kausalya shed tears,
akin to new rain water flowing from channel.
Capturing on her own head, the king's palms joined in the form of a lotus, Kausalya was scared and spoke weeping in hurriedly lettered words in eagerness.
"O, king! I appeal to you with my bowed head. I lie prostrate on the floor. I am
ruined. I am not to be forgiven indeed by you."
"O, Valiant man! In both the worlds, it is ill-becoming of a woman, being
propitiated by her husband, who is praise worthy and possessing good disposition."
"O, valiant man! In both the worlds, it of a woman, being propitiated by her
husband, who is praise worthy and possessing good disposition."
"Grief ruins courage. Grief ruins sacred learning, grief ruins all. There is no
enemy like grief."
"A hitting that descended from the hands of an enemy is possible to be tolerated.
But, the grief suddenly descended, even if so small, is not possible to be tolerated."
"O, valiant man! Even ascetics, who know righteousness, who have learnt sacred texts and who have rent asunder doubts relating to religious merit and wealth, go astray having their minds infatuated with grief."
"Today it is counted as five days since Rama has gone to exile. It is equal to five years for me, since grief has ruined my happiness."
"While I think of Rama, this grief in my heart is increasing, like water in a great ocean increases with the fast streaming of rivers.
While Kausalya was telling auspicious words indeed as aforesaid the sun became
feeble and turned towards night too.
The king, thus cheered up by the queen Kausalya, got subjected to slumber, after
having been overcome by grief.To him, to such an effectual and virtuously great-souled King Dasharatha, a dynasty-enriching son is
not begotten though his heart is burning to beget children. 
To that anguished great-soul, a thought occurred this way, "To beget sons, why should not I perform
Horse ritual... 
That intellectual and a conscientious king having resolved with all of his sagacious ministers that such
a Vedic ritual is performable, then addressed best ne among ministers, namely Sumantra, "fetch all my teachers and
clerics, quickly.." 
Then Sumantra gone quickly, for he in quickness is a dauntless one, and fetched all of the clerics like
Suyajna, Vaama Deva, Jaabala, Kashyapa, and even Sage Vashishta, and also those other eminent Brahman that are Vedic
scholars. 
Then on adoring them virtuous King Dasharatha spoke this impressible sentence that included
justification and meaning. 
"My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... for that reason, I wish perform Aswamedha,
Vedic Horse Ritual... this is my thinking... 
"Therefore, I contemplate to perform that ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and as a rite-oriented
one as well... let this contemplation of mine be well thought of... and as to how my desire to beget sons will be
fulfilled... 
Then the Brahman scholars along with Sage Vashishta and all other important personalities in their turn
have blessed and honoured him, saying that "splendid is this idea..." thus, for that which is voiced by the king.

All of them becoming happy have also said to King Dasharatha, "let the paraphernalia be provided, and
your ritual-horse be released... 
"Oh, king, by all means you will beget sons as you desired, since you, to whom an upright thinking has
suggested itself... let the ritual ground be arranged on the northern banks of River Sarayu..." So said the scholars.

" Then King Dasharatha is gladdened on hearing the sayings of those Brahmans. And with happiness
lurching on his eyes the king spoke to the ministers, "As advised by my Vedic teachers let the paraphernalia be
procured... 
"On the northern banks of River Sarayu the ritual ground be arranged... and the Ritual-Horse be released
monitored by capable warriors, along with the religious teachers..." So said the king. 
"Let peace invocations be prevailing and prospering, as ordained in the scriptures and tradition...if it
is possible for the correct performance to obtain results of this ritual, and if it is possible to conduct this ritual
without any difficult faults during its performance, then all the kings on earth would have performed it... 
"Scholarly Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults alone in the course of this ritual... should the
procedure of this ritual be depraved of its set rules, the performer gets ruined... 
"Therefore, you all shall see as to how this ritual of mine be conducted and concluded procedurally, and
all of you are evidently experts in conducting such rituals... isn't it! 
On listening the words of the king all the ministers adored and assured him saying, 'It will be
conducted faultlessly as has been conducted earlier...' 
On hearing those words of that best king, and what that is spoken earlier, then the virtue knowing
Brahman scholars hailing that best king took leave of him and went away as they have come. 
Then on sending off those Brahman scholars, the king spoke this way to the ministers... "As advised by
the Vedic scholars this ritual shall be conducted, procedurally..." 
Tha tigerly-king and highly intellectual Dasharatha, on saying thus to his ministers who are still in
his audience, sent away those ministers also, and he entered his palace. 
And on approaching his wives, that best king's heartily dear ones, he said to them, " I am performing a
Vedic ritual for the reason of begetting sons, and you all shall enter a vow..." 
On hearing those words of the king, the lustrous countenances of the queens have become more gleaming,
like the blooming lotuses after the clearance of dew-fall. Seeing his brother stretched on the ground, Nikumbha cast angry looks at Sugreeva, as 
it would burn him into ashes.
Then, Nikumbha of firm mind grasped his iron club, stupendous like the crest of Mount 
Mandara and which was bright, festooned with wreaths and provided with iron plates, measuring five digits 
in breadth.
Round it ran a broad strip of gold while diamonds and rubies studded it all over. Like 
the death-dealing rod of Yama, it seemed causing dismay to the monkeys and nerving the demons with courage.
Wielding that weapon, which in size resembled the flag-staff of Indra, Nikumbha of terrific 
prowess, roared with his mouth yawing wide.
On his chest shone a medal of gold. His arms were held by beautiful bracelets. Lustrous 
pendants depended from his ear. Resplendent garland enfolded his neck. With these ornaments and with 
his club, Nikumbha assumed the threatening semblance of a cloud, with lightning and thunder and shot 
with a vivid rainbow.
The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like 
splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma.
The sky above appeared whirled around in the toss of Nikumbha's club, as though Alaka 
the City with the palaces of Gandharvas performed rapid revolutions and the moon and the stars and the 
planets joining the rotating race.
The hot tempered fire of Nikumbha, which had his club and ornaments for its flame and 
his fury as its fuel, became dangerous to be approached, like the fire rising at the time of dissolution 
of the world.
The demons and the monkeys too, out of fear, were unable even to make the slightest movement. 
The mighty Hanuma, on his part, stood alone among them, with his breast bared to the fury of the attack, 
in front of Nikumbha.
The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like 
splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma.
The titanic club, which fell on the wide and rock-like chest of Hanuma, at once shattered 
into hundreds of fragments, like hundreds of meteors shattering into the sky.
That Hanuma, struck by that blow of the club, was unmoved like a mountain in an earthquake.
Thus struck by him, the mighty Hanuma the monkey-chief clenched his fist forcibly.
The greatly splendoured, powerful and swift Hanuma, with the violence of the wind-god, 
his father, lifting that fist, struck it against, Nikumbha's breast with force.
By the blow of that fist there, his armour got split up and red blood profusely oozed 
out, as a black cloud streaked suddenly with fierce lightning.
But, by that blow, Nikumbha was unmoved, recovered soon and grasped the unwieldy bulk 
of Hanuma.
Seeing the mighty Hanuma lifted off the ground in battle, loud roar of exultant joy rose 
from the ranks of demons.
Eventhough he was being carried off in that way by that demon, Hanuma the son of wind-god, 
struck him with his thunderbolt-like fist.
Freeing himself from Nikumbha, Hanuma the son of wind-god then threw him down on the 
ground and treated him with blows.
Throwing down Nikumbha by main force and with a supreme effort, Hanuma descended on him, 
leaped on his chest and pounded it mercilessly.
Then with both hands, he caught the enemy's neck, twisted it about and tore off his huge 
head, while Nikumbha was horribly roaring.
Then, while the roaring Nikumbha was killed in battle by Hanuma, there ensued an exceedingly 
terrific struggle between the enraged Rama and Makaraksha, son of Khara, a ruler of demons.
When it was clear that Nikumbha had expired, the monkeys shouted with glee, the quarters 
thundered with satisfaction, the earth rocked with joy, the heaven appeared to crumble and fear seized 
the army of demons.That Kumbhakarna of great prowess and the foremost, having full of intoxicating
drowsiness, marched along the king's highway, full of royal dignity.
Then, that Kumbhakarna, who was very difficult to be conquered, accompanied by
thousands of demons, sallied forth, covered with a shower of flowers from the houses (lining the
way).
He saw Ravana's abode, covered with golden grilled windows, spacious and looking
beautiful, like a shining sun.
Entering Ravana's palace, like the sun entering a mass of clouds, Kumbhakarna then
saw from of distance his brother seated on a throne, as Indra saw Brahma perched on his seat.
While going to his brother's palace, that Kumbhakarna, accompanied by troops of
demons, caused the earth to shake with his stamping strides.
Reaching his brother's house and entering the inner apartment, Kumbhakarna saw his
worried brother sitting in Pushpaka, a self-moving aerial car.
On seeing Kumbhakarna who arrived there, Ravana then quickly rose up from his seat,
delighted and brought him nearer to his side.
Then, the mighty Kumbhakarna having offered salutation to the feet of his brother
sitting on a sofa, asked him, "What is to be done?"
Rising up from his seat, Ravana embraced him. That Kumbhakarna, who was thus
embraced and made happy by his brother, occupied an auspicious, charming and excellent seat.
Resting on that seat, the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his blood-shot eyes in anger,
spoke to Ravana as follows:
"O king! For what purpose have I been woken up by you, with effort? Tell me from
whom is the danger for you here and who is to be killed."
Ravana, with his eyes rolling with annoyance, spoke to Kumbhakarna, his brother, who
was there with anger (as follows):
"O mighty Kumbhakarna! You slept for a long period. You, who were fast asleep, do
not know about the fear created by Rama in me."
"This Rama, the son of Dasaratha, a strong man along with Sugreeva, having crossed
the ocean, is cutting short our race."
"Alas! See! Coming happily by a bridge, the forests and groves have been covered
with an ocean full of monkeys."
"The monkeys killed very important demons in battle. I do not envisage, in any way,
the destroyable of monkeys on the battle-field. It seems the monkeys were not even defeated at any
time before, in a combat."
"O mighty Kumbhakarna! Such a danger has arisen. You have to help us now. Get them
destroyed now. You have been woken up solely for that purpose."
"Rescuing me, whose treasury has become completely diminished, you protect this city
of Lanka, where only the children and the aged are left over."
"O the great armed Kumbhakarna. For the sake of your brother, perform this act,
which is very difficult to do. O brother, the annihilator of enemies! In this way, I did not
request anyone ever before."
"I have a great respect and affection towards you. O the foremost of demons! For
several times, in battles between gods and demons, you conquered the celestials and demons, after
attacking them in the battle."
"O Kumbhakarna of terrible prowess! Therefore, show your entire prowess. There is
indeed no one, in the entire beings, who is equal to you in strength."
"O Kumbhakarna, delighting in war and feeling affection for relatives! Perform this
excellent act, which is dear and beneficial to me, as per your liking. Blow away the army of
adversaries by your vital power, as an autumnal cloud is blown away by a high-rising wind."Hearing the lamentation of Ravana, Kumbhakarna laughed at a full volume and spoke as 
follows:
"The same bad consequence, which was imagined by us earlier while taking the final decision 
after our consultation, is faced by you now, due to your utter disregard of the words spoken by your 
well-wishers."
"How a doer of wicked deeds indeed falls into damnation, so also a punishment for your 
sinful act has indeed reached your fast."
"O emperor! This course of action was not excepted by you at first. You did not conceive 
this consequence, only because of your sheer arrogance of power."
"He who, abiding in power, performs duties to be done earlier at a later stage and duties 
to be done later, at an early stage, does not know what is a right course and what is a wrong course."
"Action done perversely, regardless of space and time, get spoiled like offering oblations 
without properly making the fire well-prepared."
"He, who acts according to an agreement done with his counsellors, considering three 
types of duties*, by harassing five types of means**, moves along a right course."
"A king who wishes to execute am agreement as per law, understands it through his own 
intellect as well as the counsellors and discovers it through his friends, is on a right course."
"O king of demons! A man resorts to virtue or worldly gain or pleasure or all the three 
together or a twin combination of virtue and worldly gain or virtue and pleasure or worldly gain and 
pleasure or worldly gain and pleasure, according to an appointed time*."
"That sovereign king or crown prince, who, having heard which one is the best out of 
these three but does not keep it in mind, his extensive learning would be in vain."
"O the foremost of demons! Whosoever deliberates with his counsellors and resorts to 
an act of with his counsellors and resorts to an act of bestowing gifts or conciliation or sowing dissension 
at appropriate occasion or exhibits valour or resorts to them all together or takes recourse to both 
right action and the reverse of it at the right time or pursues virtue or worldly gain or pleasure at 
the appropriate time, that intelligent person never confronts a misfortune in this world."
"A sovereign has to do an act here, looking into his welfare as a consequence along with 
his counsellors who make their subsistence by their intelligence and who understand the true state of 
the things."
"Men with brutal ideas, who are initiated in discussions, aspire to tell haughty things, 
without fully knowing the precepts of the scriptures."
"The words spoken by those who did not know the scriptures, who do not recollect the 
books dealing with practical life and who covet for abundant wealth are not to be implemented."
"Those men who talk with audacity, some inimical things in a friendly way, are to be 
kept out of deliberations, as they certainly spoil the work to be done."
"Some counsellors, colluding with some learned adversaries, spoil their king and make 
them do wrong deeds."
"The king should make-out those ministers who have been transformed by the enemy to their 
side (through bribery and other things) and are enemies though looking like friends, through their conduct 
when a final decision is being taken after deliberation."
"Outsiders find out the fickleness of a ruler, who is led away by false appearances and 
quickly performs the acts, as birds discover the hole (made by the arrow of Skanda, the commander-in-chief 
of gods) in the Kruancha mountain."
"A king who disregards an enemy and does not protect himself, indeed faces disappointing 
occurrences and would be removed from his position."
"That advice which was tendered to you earlier by vibhishana is beneficial to us. Do 
whatever you wish to do."
On hearing those words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana, on his part, twisted his eye-brows in 
anger and spoke the following words:
"Why are you advising me like a venerable great teacher? What is the use in getting wearied 
of your speech? Let a work, most befitting of time, be performed."
"Now, it is a waste to tell again of that act which was wrongly done before, either by 
mistake or by an illusion of mind or by taking shelter in strength and prowess."
"Let whatever be appropriate at this moment be thought of now. Wise men do not repent 
over the past. Past is indeed but the past."
"If you have affection indeed for me or if you discover your own prowess and if you think 
it fit in your heart that my work is to be done very much, you nullify the hardship, born out of my 
wicked conduct, by your prowess."
"He who rescues an afflicted soul, whose fortune is ruined, he is the real friend. He 
who is ready at hand to help those who have deviated from the right course, is a kinsman."
Thereupon, hearing those deeply harsh words spoken by Ravana and understanding that he 
is quite enraged, Kumbhakarna spoke slowly and smoothly.
Observing that his brother is highly perturbed and excited of his senses, Kumbhakarna, 
while consoling him, gently spoke the following words:
"O king, the annihilator of adversaries! Listen to my words attentively. O emperor of 
demons! Enough of your giving way to the anguish. Abandoning your anger completely, you ought to be 
your normal self again."
"O king! Until I live, this idea should not be formed in your mind. I shall destroy him, 
for whose account, you are feeling anguished."
"O king! In whatever situation you are placed, I have to give certainly a good advice 
to you. I gave this advice, because of our relation and brotherly affection."
"See that which is to be done and this juncture, out of affection by a brother, viz. 
the destruction of adversaries in battle, will be done by me."
"See today, O mighty armed king, the fleeing army of monkeys and Rama along with his 
brother being killed by me in the fore-front of the battle-field."
"O the mighty armed! Be happy by seeing that Rama's head, which I shall bring today from 
the battle. Let Seetha be unhappy."
"Let all those demons in Lanka, whose relatives have died in battle, witness the death 
of the most beloved Rama today."
"Today, I shall do the act of wiping off tears of demons, who have been afflicted with 
grief and lamenting because of the destruction of their relatives in combat by the adversaries."
"See today in battle, the mountain-like Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, looking like a 
cloud illuminated by the sun, thrown about, dissipated."
"O faultless Ravana! Why are you agitated now, when you are being consoled by those demons 
and by me, who are desirous of killing Rama?"
"O king of demons! Rama will indeed kill you, only after killing me. On that account, 
I do not regret for myself."
"O Ravana, having unequal prowess and the annihilator of enemies! You can command me, 
even now, as you wish. No other person need be sought, for a dispatch to the battle."
"I can destroy your enemies, who have a great strength. I can engage in combat with all 
those persons, whether he is Indra or Yama or the fire-god to the wind-god or even Varuna."
"Indra also gets frightened of me, having a mountain-sized body wielding a sharpened 
pike, having pointed tusks and even as I roar."
"Even otherwise, no one can stand alive in front of me, who is even weaponless and smashing 
the enemies by me strength alone."
"Without using a javelin or a mace or a sword or sharp arrows, I myself, on getting excited, 
can kill even Indra, with my bare hands."
"If Rama today survives even after facing the rapid blows of my fists, then my flood 
of arrows will drink the blood of Rama."
"O king! When I exist, why do you suffer from anxiety? Here, I am ready to sally forth 
for the destruction of your enemies."
"Be free from the terrific fear of Rama. In the battle, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, 
the mighty Sugreeva and even Hanuma, by whom the city of Lanka was burnt off and the demons were killed."
"I shall devour the monkeys in battle, which is near at hand. I wish to contribute a 
tremendous and extraordinary reputation for you."
'O king! If you have a fear for Indra or even for Brahma, I shall remove it then, as 
the sun removes darkness of the night. When I am enraged, even celestials will lay down on the floor."
"I shall extinguish even Yama the god of death. I shall devour the fire-god. I shall 
cause the sun along with the stars to fall asunder on the floor."
"I shall kill Indra. I shall drink away the ocean. I shall crush the mountains into a 
powder. I shall tear up the earth."
"Let all the living beings, being devoured from all sides see today the prowess of Kumbhakarna, 
who slept for a long time. The entire heaven is not enough for my food."
"I am going to bring you happiness, conferring you a delight by the destroyal of Rama. 
Having killed Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the chiefs of army of monkeys."
"O king! You make merry today and drink wine. Throw away your agony and perform your 
usual duties. While I send Rama to the world of Yama, the god of death, Seetha will be subservient to 
your after a log time."Hearing the words of Mahodara, Kumbhakarna rebuked him and then spoke to his
brother, Ravana, the chief of demons (as follows):
"By annihilation of that evil-minded Rama, I will wipe-off your terrifc fear today.
Be happy, indeed without any enmity."
"Warriors do not roar in vain as waterless clouds. Hear my roar, only on completion
of my said task in battle."
"Warriors do not indulge in eulogizing themselves. They do difficult acts, without a
show."
"O Mahodara! Your words may be agreeable to those kings who are confused, who fancy
themselves as the learned, and who themselves are stupid."
"You are all cowards in battle. You always speak pleasantly and go according to the
wishes of the king. You, as such, have spoiled all the undertakings."
"Having access to this king, who has friends merely for a name-sake as also behaving
unfriendly, the treasury got depleted, the army destroyed and king alone is left the Lanka."
"Intent on conquering the enemy, I sally for the battle today to set right your
imprudent policy."
Hearing the words of the intellectual Kumbhakarna, Ravana the king of demons,
bursting into laughter, replied as follows:
"O dear brother, well-versed in the art of war-fare! This Mahodara is frightened of
Rama. There is no doubt. He is not indeed inclined of a war."
"O Kumbhakarna! None is equal to you in friendship and strength, in my eyes. You
march to the battlefield for destroying the enemies and for achieving victory."
"O destroyer of enemies! You, who were sleeping, were awakened by me, for the
purpose of destroying the enemies. This is indeed a grand time for our demons."
"Therefore, go like Yama the god of death, by taking a dart and a noose in your
hand. Devour the monkeys and the princes whose splendour is like that of the sun."
"By seeing your very form, the monkeys will run away. The hearts of Rama and
Lakshmana will get broken asunder."
Ravana, the king of demons, having a great energy, thus speaking to the mighty
Kumbhakarna, thought himself as though he was born again.
The king, knowing the strength and prowess of Kumbhakarna, was delighted and became
as bright as the moon.
Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some others
escaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as though
they were dead.
Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, speedily took up a sharp spike fully made
of iron, adorned with pure gold and splendidly shining.
Taking hold of that large spike tinted with the blood of enemies, shining like
Indra's thunderbolt and equally heavy, capable of tormenting celestials, demons, Gandharvas, the
celestial musicians, Yakshas a class of demi-gods and Nagas the celestial serpents, wreathed in
garlands of crimson flowers with excessive splendour and emitting flames by itself naturally,
Kumbhakarna of great brilliance spoke to Ravana the following words:
"Let this large army stay back here. I shall go all alone. Being angry with hunger,
I shall devour those monkeys now."
Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana said, "Go along with army, with their
spikes and hammers in hand."
"The monkeys, with their huge bodies, valiant, with a much determination and with
their teeth, will destroy anyone who is either alone or off one's guard."
"Therefore, go along with your troops as a person who is very difficult to be
assaulted. Destroy the entire enemy-side, which in inimical to our demons."
Rising up swiftly from his throne, Ravana endowed with a great energy, then placed
around the neck of Kumbhakarna, a necklace studded with a course of jewels.
Ravana placed on the person of Kumbhakarna, armlets, rings, excellent jewellery and
a handsome chain.
Ravana arranged for ornamentation of his limbs with beautiful and sweet-smelling
garlands as well as ear-rings to his ears.
Kumbhakarna with large ears, adorned with golden armlets and bracelets worn on his
upper arms along with ornament for his breast, shone like fire, well-fed with oblations.
With a large, black and shining string worn round his loins, he was looking like
Mount Mandara encircled by a serpent at the time of churning the ambrosia.
Secured with a golden armour, carrying a great load, impenetrable by weapons and as
if blazing with its own splendour with flashing like lightning, Kumbhakarna shone as a king of
Mountains, enveloped by clouds at sunset.
Adorned with all ornaments to all his limbs and with a spike in his hand, that demon
shone like Narayana, the all-embracing Lord, enthusiastic to take the three long strides (which
were meant to cover the entire universe).
Embracing his brother and even circumambulating him, the mighty Kumbhakarna sallied
forth, after offering salutation to him by bowing down to him respectfully.
Ravana sent off the mighty Kumbhakarna, having a colossal body, who was then
sallying forth, with a great sound (of drums and musical instruments) and with laudable
benedictions.
With loud sounds of counches and kettle-drums, with an army wielding excellent
weapons, with elephants, with horses and with chariots making sounds of clouds, mighty charioteers
accompanied him who was the foremost among the charioteers.
Those demons followed that terrific and mighty Kumbhakarna, mounting on serpents,
camels donkeys, lions, elephants, wild beasts and birds.
That Kumbhakarna, the enemy of ogres and celestials, wielding a sharp spike in his
hand, while sallying forth, over whose head a parasol was held and drink and intoxicated by the
smell of blood.
Many demons, possessing a great energy and great strength, with terrific forms and
fearful eyes, as also wielding weapons in their hands, accompanied him as foot-soldiers.
The demons followed, with their red hot eyes, large colossal bodies resembling a
mass of collyrium in hue, lifting up spikes, swords, sharp axes, javelins, iron rods, maces,
mallets, enormous trunks of palmyrah trees to be hurled at and difficult to be met.
Then, that Kumbhakarna, of a great splendour and a great strength, assuming another
body of a formidable and terrific form, with a breadth of a hundred bows and six hundred bows in
height, with his eyes resembling the wheels of a cart, looking like a huge mountain and terrible to
look at, sallied forth.
Kumbhakarna with his colossal body and a huge mouth, looking like a scorched hill,
approaching the demons and laughing loudly, spoke as follows:
"Charged with anger, I shall burn up those troops of the foremost of monkeys, in
lots today, as a flash of fire would burn up the moths."
"The monkeys who are in the habit of roaming about in the woods, have not offended
me of their own accord. That race of monkeys serves as an embellishment for the urban gardens in a
city like ours."
"Rama, together with Lakshmana, is the root-cause for the attack on our city. If he
is killed, all will be destroyed. Therefore, I shall kill that Rama in battle."
While Kumbhakarna was speaking in that way, the demons made a very terrific noise,
as though they were agitating the ocean.
As that intelligent Kumbhakarna was sallying forth quickly for the battle, omens of
terrific patterns appeared on all sides.
Clouds, ashy in colour like asses, combined with meteors and strokes of lightning
appeared. Even the earth trembled, together with its oceans and forests.
Jackals of terrific form howled with flaming morsels in their mouths and birds
twirled in circles from right to left.
A vulture descended on the spike of Kumbhakarna, as he was sallying forth along the
road. His left eye twitched and his left arm throbbed.
Then, a blazing meteor fell down with a dreadful noise. Even the sun became
lusterless and the wind was not blowing comfortably.
Disregarding those great portents indicated, causing the hair to stand erect,
Kumbhakarna on his part marched on, driven by the power of fate.
Kumbhakarna, looking like a mountain, traversing the rampart with his feet alone,
saw a wonderful army of monkeys, looking similar to a thick coverage of clouds.
Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the excellent among demons, looking equal to a mountain,
the monkeys then ran away to all directions, as clouds are driven away by the wind.
Looking towards that highly fierce army of monkeys, running away to different
quarters, as a net-work of broken clouds, that Kumbhakarna with the hue of a black cloud, highly
rejoiced, repeatedly emitted a roar-like thunder.
Hearing his terrific roar, similar to the rumbling of a cloud in the sky, many of
those monkeys fell down on the ground, like Sal trees cut-up by the roots.
Wielding a large iron rod for the destroyable of the enemies, that gigantic
Kumbhakarna looked like Yama the lord of death armed with a rod of punishment, waiting upon him as
his attendant at the time of dissolution of the world and caused a great terrific fear to the
troops of monkeys.Hearing the words of Angada, all those large-bodied monkeys who came back, having
arrived at a firm resolution, were waiting for the battle.
Restored to confidence by the words of the mighty Angada, those monkeys, whose
energy was well-augmented and prowess well-elevated, restored to a thrill of rapture and as they
were determined to die, marched forward to fight. Ready to abandon their lives, they were engaged
in a tumultuous battle.
Lifting up trees and very large mountain-rocks, the large-bodied monkeys thereupon
briskly ran towards Kumbhakarna.
The mighty and valiant Kumbhakarna, who got very much enraged, lifting a mace and
frightening his enemies, diffused them on all sides.
Seven hundred, eight hundred and thousands of monkeys struck by Kumbhakarna, lay
scattered on the ground.
That highly enraged Kumbhakarna, putting in his mount, (as many as) sixteen or eight
or ten or even twenty or thirty monkeys by his hands and devouring them like. Garuda the mythical
bird devouring the serpents in lots, ran about the battle-field.
Restored to confidence with difficulty, the monkeys assembling together from all
sides, stood in the battle-front, with trees and rocks in their hands.
Pulling out a mountain and looking like a hanging cloud, Dvivida the foremost among
the monkeys, ran towards Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain-peak.
Dvivida, springing up, hurled that mountain towards Kumbhakarna. Even without
reaching the colossal bodied Kumbhakarna, it however fell on his army.
That excellent mountain crushed the horses, elephants and the chariots. Another
mountain-top, when hurled, crushed the other demons.
Struck by the jerk of the mountain, that great battle-field of demons, with its
horses and charioteers killed, became dampened with blood.
The demons who fight from the chariots, with their terrific roar, at once discarded
the heads of the clamouring chiefs of monkeys, with their arrows, which were resembling the god of
death at the time of universal dissolution.
Uprooting large trees, the mighty monkeys too began to destroy the chariots, horses,
Camels and demons.
Staying in the sky, Hanuma showered mountain-tops, rocks and various types of trees
on Kumbhakarna's head.
The mighty Kumbhakarna broken those mountain-tops and shattered the torrent of trees
with his spike.
Then, taking the dreadful spike in his hand, Kumbhakarna ran towards that terrific
army of monkeys. Taking a mountain-peak in his hands, Hanuma stood in front of the approaching
Kumbhakarna.
The enraged Hanuma struck with violence Kumbhakarna, who was endowed with a
magnificent body and looking like the most elevated mountain. Thus attacked by Hanuma, Kumbhakarna
was stumbled with a sprinkling of blood and with his limbs succulent with flesh.
Holding firmly the spike, which was bright as lightning and looking like a blazing
mountain-peak, Kumbhakarna struck Hanuma on his chest, as Guha (the son of Shiva) struck Krauncha
mountain with his powerful javelin.
That Hanuma, struck in his broad chest by the spike in that great combat, was highly
perturbed and while vomiting blood from his mouth, awfully roared like the sound of thunderous
clouds at the time of dissolution of the world.
Looking at the perturbed Hanuma, all the troops of demons then suddenly shouted with
rejoice. The monkeys, on their part, felt restless and being oppressed with fear, ran away from the
battle-field.
Thereupon, cheering up the army and stopping them, the mighty Neela then hurled a
mountain-top on the intellectual Kumbhakarna.
Seeing that mountain-top befalling on him, Kumbhakarna then struck it with his fist.
By that strike of the fist, that mountain-top was burst into pieces and fallen down on the ground,
with sparks of fire and blaze.
The five excellent monkeys, viz. Rishabha, Sharabha, Neela, Gavaksha and
Gandhamadana marched ahead quickly towards Kumbhakarna.
Those five mighty monkeys struck the large-bodied Kumbhakarna from all sides, with
crags, trees, palms of their hands, feet and fists in battle.
Perceiving those blows merely as the senses of touch, Kumbhakarna was not at all
perturbed. He enfolded the greatly agitated Rishabha in his arms.
Squeezed by Kumbhakarna's arms, the awful Rishabha, the foremost among the monkeys,
fell down with blood coming out of his mouth.
Then, in battle, the enraged Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, beating Sharabha with
his fist and Neela with his knee, struck Gavaksha with a palm of his hand and struck Gandhamadana
violently with his feet.
Perturbed by the blows given by Kumbhakarna, those monkeys being moistened with
blood, were bewildered and fell down on the ground, like chopped off Kimsuka trees.
Seeing those mighty chief commanders of monkeys falling down on the ground,
thousands of monkeys ran towards Kumbhakarna.
All those champions of monkeys, looking like mountains, jumping up on Kumbhakarna
who was looking like a mountain, ascended him and bit him with their teeth.
Those mighty armed excellent monkeys encountered that Kumbhakarna with their nails,
teeth, fists and arms.
Covered by thousands of monkeys that foremost among demons looking like a mountain,
stood out in a crowd, as a hill overgrown with trees.
Seizing all the monkeys with his arms, that mighty Kumbhakarna devoured them like an
enraged Garuda the eagle devouring the serpents.
Hurled by Kumbhakarna in his mouth which was looking like a hole in the earth, the
monkeys again came out from his nostrils and ears.
Kumbhakarna, the best among the demons, looking like a mountain, was very much
enraged and mutilated the monkeys angrily, before devouring them.
Making the earth dampened with flesh and blood, that demon, like an excited fire at
the time of dissolution, strolled among that army of monkeys.
Wielding a spike in his hand in the battle-front, the mighty Kumbhakarna shone like
Indra the lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt in his hand and like Yama the god of death
wielding a noose in his hand.
That Kumbhakarna scorched away that army of monkeys in the same way as the fire
scorches away the dried-up forests in summer.
Those monkeys, without a commander, having their troops killed and terrified with
fear they were being destroyed by Kumbhakarna, roared with rebellious voices.
While Kumbhakarna was destroying them in many ways, the agitated monkeys sought
refuge in Rama, with their distressed minds.
Seeing the monkeys defeated in that great battle, Angada the son of Indra, ran
rapidly towards Kumbhakarna.
Taking a large mountain-top, Angada, roaring repeatedly and frightening all the
demons following Kumbhakarna's heels, hurled the mountain-top on Kumbhakarna's head.
Struck on the head with that mountain, that Kumbhakarna, Indra's adversary, with a
great rage, was excited and then ran rapidly towards the wrathful Angada.
Frightening all the monkeys with his great roar, the mighty Kumbhakarna hurled his
spike at Angada with anger.
Knowing that the spike is going to fall on him, the mighty Angada, the chief of the
monkeys, who was skilled in war-fare, avoided it with his alacrity.
Jumping up Angada struck on Kumbhakarna's chest, with the palm of his hand. Thus
beaten with anger by him, Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain, became giddy.
Getting his consciousness, that mighty demon threw down Angada by tightening his
fist with a scorn. Angada fell down unconscious.
When that Angada the foremost among the monkeys fell down unconscious on the ground,
Kumbhakarna ran towards Sugreeva, taking that spike in his hand.
Then, seeing the mighty Kumbhakarna coming suddenly towards him, the valiant
Sugreeva, the king of the monkeys, sprang up all at once.
Uplifting and tightly holding a mountain-top, the mighty Sugreeva ran towards the
sturdy Kumbhakarna with speed.
Seeing that Sugreeva coming rapidly towards him, Kumbhakarna, with all his limbs
braced, stood facing the king of monkeys.
Seeing Kumbhakarna who stood devouring the monkeys and with his body smeared with
the blood of the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke as follows:
"You struck down eminent monkeys. You have done a very difficult act. You have
devoured the armies. You obtained a great fame."
"Leave that army of monkeys. What will you do with these common beings? O demon! You
bear up against the falling of this one mountain being hurled by me."
Hearing those words, endowed with strength and courage, spoken by Sugreeva,
Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, spoke the following words:
"O monkey! You are the grandson of Lord Brahma and even the son of Riksharaja
(sprung from the yawn of Brahma) endowed with firmness and valour. Why do you roar?"
Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Sugreeva, firmly holding the mountain, hurled it
quickly on him. He struck Kumbhakarna's chest by that mountain, which was as strong enough as
Indra's thunderbolt.
Soon after falling on his broad chest, that mountain was crushed to pieces. Then,
the monkeys were suddenly distressed. The troops of demons roared with rejoice.
Struck by the mountain-top, that Kumbhakarna was enraged and roared with his mouth
wide open with anger. Holding firmly the spike, which was emitting a flash of lightning, he hurled
it to kill Sugreeva, the king of monkeys and bears.
Hanuma, jumping up and holding with his arms that sharp spike, furnished with golden
wreaths, and propelled by Kumbhakarna's arms, wreaths, and smashed it rapidly.
Then, the rejoiced Hanuma, placing on his knee, that large spike made of iron
weighing twenty thousand Tulas, broke it.
Seeing Hanuma breaking the spike, that army of monkeys was rejoiced, roared several
times and came back quickly from all quarters.
Then, the frightened Kumbhakarna became down-cast. Those monkeys were rejoiced and
made a lion's roar. Seeing the fate of spike in such a broken condition, they adored Hanuma.
Seeing that spike broken in that way, that mighty Kumbhakarna was enraged. Uprooting
a crest from Malaya mountain standing in the vicinity of Lanka and approaching Sugreeva, he struck
him with it.
Struck by the mountain-top in battle, that Sugreeva fell unconscious on the ground.
Seeing him falling unconscious on the ground in battle, the demons wee exceedingly pleased and
cried out loudly.
Seizing hold of that Sugreeva having wonderful and terrific prowess in battle, that
Kumbhakarna took him away, as an impetuous wind takes away a cloud.
Lifting up Sugreeva appearing like a huge cloud in the battle-field and marching
forward, Kumbhakarna shone like Mount Meru, distinguished by its very high and formidable peak.
Then, being praised in the battle-field by the demons for having seized hold of
Sugreeva and hearing the sounds of the celestials who were wondering at the seizure of Sugreeva,
Kumbhakarna the valiant chief of demons, sallied forth.
While taking away that Sugreeva looking like Indra, Kumbhakarna the adversary of
Indra and having the prowess of Indra, thought, "If he is killed, all this army including Rama gets
destroyed."
Seeing the army of monkeys running away hither and thither and Sgureeva the monkey
even being taken away by Kumbhakarna, the intellectual Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought as
follows:
"While Sugreeva is being taken away in this way, what is to be done by me? I shall
certainly do that which is justifiable to be done by me. Growing to the size of a mountain, I shall
destroy this Kumbhakarna."
"Let all the monkeys be delighted while Sugreeva the king of monkeys is liberated
and the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his body crumbled by the blows of my fists, killed by me in
battle."
"Even otherwise, this Sugreeva can win the freedom himself despite he is taken away
by celestials including demons and serpent-demons."
"I think Sugreeva is not yet conscious of his self, as Kumbhakarna struck him with
the blow of a mountain in the battle."
"Regaining his consciousness within a moment in this great battle, this Sugreeva
will do what is good for himself and for his monkeys."
"If I liberate this great-souled Sugreeva, there will be a painful dislike for him
and a perpetual in fame."
'Therefore, I shall wait for a while, for the king to show his prowess. Meanwhile, I
shall cheer up the scattered army of monkeys."
Thinking in this way, Hanuma the son of wind-god, then again brought firmness to the
large army of monkeys.
Taking that Sugreeva who was throbbing, that kumbhakarna entered the City of Lanka,
where he was greatly revered with showers of foremost flowers by the citizens staying in celestial
cars, streets, houses and gate-ways of temples.
Sprinkled by those showers of pop-corn and fragrant waters and due to the coolness
of the royal roads, the mighty Sugreeva gradually regained his consciousness.
The great souled Sugreeva, who was interposed between Kumbhakarna's shoulders,
regaining his consciousness with great difficulty and observing the royal highway of the city,
repeatedly thought (as follows):
"Having been captivated in this way, what should I do now? I have to do a proper act
now which is desirable and beneficial to the monkeys."
Thus thinking, Sugreeva tore asunder Kumbhakarna's ears by his nails as also nose by
his teeth and ribs by his feet.
Torn asunder with teeth and nails by Sugreeva, that Kumbhakarna with his ears and
nose deprived and his limbs moistened with blood, was subdued with rage, threw Sugreeva down on the
floor and crushed him.
Crushed down on the floor by that terrific Kumbhakarna and struck by the demons,
Sugreeva moved with speed like a ball towards the sky and got united with Rama.
Bereft of his ears and nose, the mighty Kumbhakarna, pouring out blood, shone like a
mountain with its streaming cascades.
Kumbhakarna the demon and the brother of Ravana, having his large body bathed in
blood, frightful in appearance, vomiting blood with rage, and looking like a mound of black
antimony shone akin to a cloud with an evening-twilight. With his face directed towards the
battle-front, Kumbhakarna the terrific demon made up his mind to continue his combat.
After the departure of Sugreeva, Kumbhakarna the adversary of Indra, with a rage,
marched ahead quickly for the battle. Finding out that he is then without any weapon, the dreadful
Kumbhakarna got possession of a hammer-like weapon.
Starting from the city quickly, that mighty Kumbhakarna then devoured that huge army
of monkeys in battle, like the devour of people by the augmented fire at the time of dissolution of
the world.
Penetrating that huge army of monkeys, Kumbhakarna who was greedily desirous of
flesh and blood in hunger, due to his deep bewilderment in battle, ate away even the demons,
monkeys, devils and bears. He devoured the principal monkeys just as the death devours people at
the time of the end of the world.
The enraged Kumbhakarna, quickly taking with his single hand, the monkeys and
demons, in one's two's, three's or in many and hurled them into his mouth
Struck with mountain-peaks, by the monkeys, the mighty Kumbhakarna, then, gushing
forth his flesh and blood, devoured the monkeys.
Thereupon, those monkeys, who were being devoured, sought Rama as their refuge. The
very much enraged Kumbhakarna, while eating away the monkeys, marched forward.
Grasping a hundred, a seven, an eight, a twenty and a thirty with his arms,
Kumbhakarna was devouring the monkeys and running about in the battle-field.
Having his entire body besmeared with flesh, marrow and blood together with wreaths
of tangled viscera hung over his ears, the demon with his very sharp teeth, rained spikes on the
monkeys, like Yama, the god of death, risen to power at the end of the world-cycle.
Immediately, Lakshmana the son of Sumitra, the annihilator of the foe's army and
conqueror of the cities of adversaries, commenced the battle with a rage.
The valiant Lakshmana pierced seven arrows into the body of Kumbhakarna. He took
some more arrows and released them too.
Tormented by that weapon of Lakshmana, that demon destroyed it completely.
Thereupon, the aggressive Lakshmana was enraged.
Then, Lakshmana covered the shining and charming golden armour of Kumbhakarna with
his arrows, even as the wind would make an evening-twilight cloud completely disappear.
Kumbhakarna, looking like a mound of collyrium, tormented by the arrows, decked with
gold, shone like the radiant sun with its rays screened by clouds.
Then, that terrific demon, with a thunderous noise of multiple clouds, spoke the
following words disrespectfully to Lakshmana.
"You declared your heroism fearlessly in battle, by attacking me, who has conquered
even the lord of death effortlessly in a combat."
"Anyone who even stands before me, the god of death, holding forth a weapon in a
great battle here, is venerable. What to tell about a person who bestows battle on me?"
"Even the powerful Indra, the lord of celestials, who mounted Airavata the elephant
and accompanied by all celestials, did not ever stand before me in battle."
"O Lakshmana! Today, I am gratified by your strength and abilities. Taking leave of
you, I desire to march forward towards Rama."
"Because I have been gratified by you by way of your ability, strength and firmness
in battle, I for my part desire to kill Rama alone, for when he is killed, all the army will be
killed."
"When Rama is killed by me battle here, I will make my army to fight with others who
remain on the battle filled and destroy them."
To that demon in battle, who has given his opinion thus, abounding in enology,
Lakshmana as though bursting with laughter, spoke the following extremely terrific words:
"O brave demon! You are telling that while you show your prowess, the heroes like
Indra and others feel unbearable; it is true. Just now, I have seen your prowess. But, see Rama the
son of Dasaratha, standing here unmoving like a mountain."
Hearing in this manner, that mighty Kumbhakarna the demon, brushing aside Lakshmana
and crossing him, ran, as though he is causing an earth-quake, towards Rama.
Thereupon, Rama, the son of Dasaratha, employing a spell (used to charm arrows)
called Raudra, discharged sharp arrows into Kumbhakarna's chest.
Flames of fire mixed with particles of charcoal came forth from the face of
Kumbhakarna, who was thus struck and who was running quickly towards Rama.
That foremost among demons, struck by Rama's arrow, roaring terribly with rage,
making the monkeys to run away in battle, ran himself towards Rama.
Those arrows, adorned with peacock's plumes, penetrated into his chest. His mace
dropped off from his hand and fell on the ground.
All his weapons fell scattered on the ground. Considering himself as weaponless,
that mighty Kumbhakarna then fought fiercely with his fists and arms.
That Kumbhakarna, with his body struck fiercely by arrows and bathed in blood,
poured forth blood, even as a mountain would pour forth a cascade.
With a terrific wrath, he felt insensible with blood. He roamed about, devouring the
monkeys, demons and bears.
Then, that Kumbhakarna, comparable to Yama the god of death, of terrific prowess and
strength, firmly holding a fearful mountain-peak, hurled it towards Rama.
Wile that mountain peak was still on its way and had not yet reached him Rama,
fixing together his well-known bow and arrows, split the mountain in the middle, with seven
straight-going arrows.
Then, Rama, the virtuous man and the elder brother of Bharata, split the large
mountain-peak which was hurled by Kumbhakarna at that time, with his variegated arrows made of
gold.
That mountain-peak, in the form of a peak of Mount Meru, as if shining with
splendour, while falling, caused two hundred monkeys to fall.
At that time, considering various strategies appropriate for killing Kumbhakarna,
the righteous Lakshmana spoke to Rama as follows:
"O king! He is not able to recognize who the monkeys are and who the demons are.
Intoxicated with the smell of blood, he is devouring his own persons and also others."
"Let the foremost of monkeys ascend well upon his body from all sides. Following the
commanders of their troops, let the monkey-leaders stand, surrounding him."
"If we do in that way, that evil-minded demon would be harassed by the huge weight,
making him to crawl on the floor and cannot kill the other monkeys."
Hearing those words of that intelligent Lakshmana, those monkeys were rejoiced and
mounted on the body of Kumbhakarna.
Kumbhakarna, when climbed upon by the monkeys, was enraged and shook them off with
violence, as a vicious elephant would shake off its mahout.
Seeing the monkeys shaken down, Rama on his part understanding that he was enraged,
jumped up speedily towards the demon and took an excellent bow.
The heroic Rama, enraged with red-hot eyes, as though he was scorching the enemy
with his looks, walked with speed, causing delight to all the leaders of the monkey-troops, who
were tormented with the fear of Kumbhakarna and quickly marched towards the demon.
Taking in his hand, a terrific bow with a firmly fastened cord looking like a snake
and looking variegated with its crust of gold, with a quiver full of excellent arrows fastened on
his back and fully restoring the monkeys to confidence, that Rama quickly marched forward.
That mighty and heroic Rama, who was highly unconquerable, accompanied by Lakshmana,
duly marched forward, surrounded by those troops of monkeys.
The mighty Rama saw the powerful Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, wearing a
crown and his eyes blood-red with anger.
Rama saw the angry Kumbhakarna, chasing all, like the mythical elephant guarding one
of the quarters, searching for the monkeys, enraged as he was and surrounded by the demons.
Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, looking like Vindhya and Mandara mountains, adorned with
armlets of gold, emitting blood from his mouth and appearing as a rising rainy cloud.
Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, who was licking the corners of his mouth which were
bathed in blood, all they way trampling the monkeys and resembling Yama in the form of
all-destroying time.
Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, having a splendour of blazing fire,
Rama, the excellent of men, then stretched his bow.
Enraged by the twang of Rama's bow, Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, not
tolerating that sound, ran towards Rama.
Thereupon, Rama spoke to the dashing Kumbhakarna looking like a cloud driven by the
wind, whose arms were like the coils of Vasuki (the king of serpents) and appearing like a mountain
in the battle-field (as follows):
"O leader of the demons! Come on. Do not regret. I sand, wielding a bow in my hand.
Know me to be the annihilator of the race of demons. You will be dead within a moment."
Coming to know that he was Rama, Kumbhakarna laughed in a rebellious tone and ran up
enraged towards the monkeys, driving them away in the battle-field.
That Kumbhakarna of great splendour, as though bursting the hearts of all the
monkeys, laughed unnaturally as also awfully and spoke the following words to Rama:
'I am neither to be considered as Viradha nor Kabandha nor Khara nor Vali nor
Maricha. It is Kumbhakarna who arrived here."
"See my large terrific hammer, completely made of iron. By it, the celestials and
the demons were conquered by me before."
"You need not treat me with contempt, as I am deprived of my ear and nose. To me,
there is no agony even indeed a little, for having lost the ear and the nose."
"O faultless excellent Rama born in Ikshavaku dynasty! Show your prowess on my
limbs. After seeing your strength and prowess, I will be devouring you."
Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, that Rama released plumed arrows. Even after
struck by them, whose speed was equal to a thunderbolt, that demon was neither shaken nor
afflicted.
Those arrows, which chopped off the Sala trees and killed Vali the foremost of
monkeys, could not torment Kumbhakarna's body which was like a thunderbolt.
Sucking those arrows with his body, as mountains suck up torments of water, that
Kumbhakarna, flourishing his hammer with terrible speed, hindered the tremendous speed of Rama's
arrows.
Then, flourishing that hammer which was smeared with blood and which can frighten
the great army of celestials, in terrific speed, that demon scared away the army of monkeys.
Thereupon, taking a great missile called Vayavya, Rama hurled it on the demon. By
that weapon, he chopped off Kumbhakarna's arm along with the hammer. With his arm chopped off,
Kumbhakarna roared tumultuously.
That Kumbhakarna's arm, identical to a mountain-peak, which was chopped off by
Rama's arrow, fell along with the hammer on that army of Sugreeva and killed that regiment of
monkeys.
Those monkeys who had escaped being broken and slain by that arm, though dejected
with their tormented limbs and taking recourse to the sides, witnessed a highly terrific encounter
between Rama and Kumbhakarna.
Having an arm chopped off by the arrow like a mountain-peak chopped off by a
gigantic sword, that Kumbhakarna with his another arm, pulled up a tree by its roots and then ran
towards Rama the lord of men in that battle-front.
By his arrow, which was made variegated by gold and furnished with a mystic spell of
Indra used for charming it, Rama chopped off Kumbhakarna's remaining arm, appearing like the coil
of a serpent along with his uprooted palm-tree.
That Kumbhakarna's arm, which appeared like a hill, was chopped off and fell down on
the ground. Wallowing hither and thither, it dashed with trees, rocks, monkeys and demons.
Seeing Kumbhakarna with his arms chopped off, abruptly with a roar, coming upon him
and taking two sharp arrows with a shape of a half-moon each, Rama chopped off the feet of the
demon in that battle.
Creating a resound everywhere in all directions, even in hill-caves, in the great
ocean, in Lanka as also in the armies of monkeys and demons, Kumbhakarna's feet fell down.
Widely opening his mouth like the mouth of a submarine fire and roaring, Kumbhakarna
whose arms and feet were cut off, ran (with thighs) quickly towards Rama, like Rahu the
seizer-demon going to seize the moon in the sky.
Rama filled up Kumbhakarna's mouth with sharply pointed arrows, having shafts
covered with gold. With his mouth full of arrows, Kumbhakarna was unable to speak. He moaned with
difficulty and even became unconscious.
Thereupon, that Rama got hold of an arrow spelled with a missile presided over by
Indra the lord of celestials, effulgent as sun's rays, resembling the rod of Brahma the lord of
creation as also the destructive Kala, the Time-Spirit, and having its speed equal to the wind.
Rama discharged against the demon, that arrow, whose shaft was inlaid with diamonds
and gold, which was shining as the dazzling sun and fire set ablaze, and which vied with the speed
of Indra's thunderbolt.
That arrow, propelled by Rama's arm, with a terrific aspect like the smokeless fire,
having a formidable energy of Indra's thunderbolt and illuminating the ten quarters with its own
splendour, proceeded forward.
That Rama slashed Kumbhakarna's head, which was looking like a huge mountain-peak,
having well-rounded tusks and with charming and quivering ear-rings, as like Indra the destroyer of
strong-holds, in the past, chopped off the head of Vritra, the demon of darkness and drought.
The large Kumbhakarna's head, adorned with ear-rings, shone like the moon being in
the middle, when the constellation, Punarvasu (presided over by Aditi the mother of gods and
consisting of twin-stars) has risen at the night.
That demon's head, equal in size to a mountain, struck by Rama's arrow, fell down.
It broke the buildings on the king's high-way and their gates as also threw down that high
rampart.
Then, that colossal demon of a great splendour fell into the sea. It crushed the
principal alligators, beautiful fishes as also snakes and entered the bowels of the earth.
While that mighty Kumbhakarna, the enemy of brahmanas and celestials was killed in
battle, the earth and mountains shook. Even the celestials raised a tumultuous roar with joy.
Then, saints of the celestial class, great sages*, serpents, gods, genii, Suparnas
(a class of bird-like beings of a semi-divine character), Guhyakas (another class of demi-gods),
including troops of Yakshas and Gandharvas (celestial musicians) standing in the sky, were rejoiced
at Rama's prowess.
Thereupon, at the mere sight of Rama, Ravana's relatives were perturbed at the
killing of Ravana of great intelligence and loudly roared, as elephants roar at the sight of a
lion.
Having destroyed Kumbhakarna in battle, that Rama shone in the midst of the army of
monkeys, in the same way as the sun shines in the midst of the celestial world, having destroyed
darkness, duly getting delivered from the mouth of Rahu.
Several monkeys were highly rejoiced, with their faces flowing like full-blown
lotuses. They adored Rama, who was dangerous to be attacked and as a beloved young man, killed an
enemy possessing a terrible strength.
By killing Kumbhakarna, who tormented the army of celestials and who was not
defeated at any time in great battles, Rama was rejoiced in the same way as Indra the lord of
celestials was rejoiced in killing Vritra, the great demon."Oh, Rama, Lady Diti was highly anguished for those sons that are killed 
			and said this to her husband, Sage Kashyapa, the son of Sage Maareechi." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. 
Oh, god, I am bereaved of my sons who are killed by your great mighty 
			sons, the sons of your second wife Aditi, as such I wish to bear a son, 
			who is achievable by sustained penance, for he shall be the exterminator 
			of Indra. 
'Such a bereaved mother as I am, I wish to undertake asceticism for 
			a son who shall become an exterminator of Indra, and who shall be the 
			ruler of worlds. As such, it will be apt of you to permit me for asceticism, 
			and further it will be apt of you to accord me pregnancy with such a 
			son.' Thus Diti spoke to her husband Kaashyapa. 
On hearing her request the great resplendent sage Kaashyapa, the son 
			of Sage Mareechi, replied Diti, who is deeply mournful. 
" 'So be it... oh, ascetically wealthy lady, you be blest, if you abide 
			by the propriety of the practises of asceticism, then you will be delivering 
			a son who can become an exterminator of Indra in war. 
'If you can complete a thousand years of asceticism punctiliously, 
			by my grace you can deliver a son who can be a husbander of three worlds.' 
			Thus Sage Kaashyapa advised his wife Diti. 
Saying thus that great resplendent sage patted her, and then on his 
			touching her she is consecrated, and then that sage Kaashyapa departed 
			for his ascetic practises, saying 'be blest.' 
On the exit of Sage Kaashyapa, oh, best one among men Rama, highly 
			elated Diti reached the sacred place called Kushaplava, on which the 
			present City of Vishala is now standing, and practised a highly rigorous 
			asceticism. 
While she is truly practising asceticism, oh, the best among men Rama, 
			that Thousand-eyed god Indra has indeed rendered services with his abundant 
			and surpassing veracities to her, who is none other than his maternal-aunt. 
			
The Thousand-eyed god Indra made available fire, firewood, water, the 
			sacred Kusha grass, fruits and like that tubers also, and whatever other 
			items she required in her ascetic practise. 
All the time Indra indeed served Diti by massaging her body, and other 
			means of removing her bodily strain resulting from her arduous practises. 
			
Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, when ten years are less to complete 
			the thousand years span of her ascetics, Diti is highly rejoiced as 
			her ambition is going to fructify in just ten more years, and then she 
			spoke to the Thousand-eyed god, Indra. 
Oh, best one among the valiant ones, Indra, to me who am practising 
			asceticism ten years are remaining to complete, then you can see your 
			brother, you be safe. 
Oh, son Indra, whom I am bringing up for your reason, I will bring 
			him up as a victory-enthusiast, and oh, son, Indra, along with him conquering 
			the three worlds you can enjoy them, without febrility from your enemies.
Oh, son Indra, whom I am now bringing up, will be enthusiastic in 
			conquering you, but somehow I will manage him by telling that you are 
			after all his brother, and no harm shall be done to you, and oh, son 
			Indra, if you join him you will get rid of your febrility, caused by 
			his emergence, and then you two can conquer all the three worlds. 
Oh, best one among gods, Indra, on my prayer your high-souled father 
			Sage Kaashyapa bestowed this boon on me for a son, which materialises 
			at the end of thousand years, and only ten more years are to slip by. 
			
When Diti was saying thus, the noontime sun was reigning high that 
			lady is stolen over by sleep keeping her feet headward. 
On observing her who has become impious by placing her head at feet-side 
			and braid falling on feet, Indra is gladdened and laughed at her failed 
			asceticism. 
Oh, Rama, being a highly courageous one, Indra the destroyer of enemy 
			fastnesses, entered the body of Diti through her vaginal aperture and 
			rent her foetus asunder into seven fragments. 
Oh, Rama, then that foetus wailed clamorously while being sliced with 
			Thunderbolt that has hundred cutting edges, and then Diti woke up. 
'Do not scream, do not scream...' thus Indra was coaxing the foetus, 
			and even though that foetus is screaming piteously the great resplendent 
			Indra has gone on fragmenting it. 
'Unkillable, unkillable is my foetus...' thus Diti raved in that way, 
			and then Indra fell out of the womb honouring his stepmother's entreaty. 
			
Indra humbly folding his palms that are still handling his bloody Thunderbolt 
			spoke to Diti, 'oh, lady, you have become impious when your braid touched 
			your feet and when you have gone to sleep in midday, and you vow is 
			thwarted.' 
"Thereby I gained a chance to eliminate him who can eliminate Indra 
			in a battle. Hence I fragmented your foetus into seven fragments, and 
			it will be apt of you to pardon me for that act of mine." So said 
			Indra to lady Diti. Thus, Sage Vishvamitra continued narration about 
			City of Vishaala. Lakshmana, endowed with auspicious bodily marks, whose limbs were drenched in blood,
felt rejoiced on having killed Indrajit in combat.
Having offered salutation to Jambavan, Hanuma and all those monkeys, that valiant
Lakshmana of great brilliance then quickly came from there to the place where Sugreeva and Rama
were there, by leaning himself upon vibhishana and Hanuma.
Having offered his salutation and approached Rama, Lakshmana stood beside his
brother, even as Lord Vamana (the younger brother of Indra) would stand beside Indra the lord of
celestials.
Then, the valiant Lakshmana, arriving at the great-souled Rama, told him in a
murmering tone (as he was feeling tiresome) about the terrific destroyal of Indrajit.
Then, the rejoiced Vibhishana informed (in a clear tone) to Rama that Indrajit's
head had been chopped off by the great-souled Lakshaman.
Just on hearing the news about the killing of Indrajit by Lakshmana, Rama of great
prowess obtained immesurable joy and spoke the following words
"O Lakshmana! Well done! I feel gratified. An ardous act has been done. Consider it
as our victory, through the destroyal of Indrajit.
Smelling the head of that Lakshmana, who had augmented his fame and yet who was
feeling abashed (to hear himself being praised), forcibly drawing him to his lap and placing that
Lakshmana his younger brother in his lap with affection, wounded as he was, that valiant Rama,
having embraced him, tenderly gazed upon him affectionately again and again.
Smelling once more the head of that Lakshmana, who was feeling tormented by the
arrows that had penetrted into his body, who had been wounded, who was breathing heard, who was
endowed with auspicious characterestics, was afflicted with agony and was feeling paine dat the
time of respiration, and hurriedly stroking him as well as restoring confidence in him, Rama the
foremost among men spoke the following words:
"An extremely noble act was performed by you, a doer of difficult things. Now, that
his son having been killed, I account Ravana to have been killed in battle."
"As that evil-minded enenmy has been killed, I become victorious. O valiant
Lakshmana! Fortunately, you indeed severed the right hand of the cruel Ravana. Indrajit is indeed
the support for that Ravana. Vibhishana and Hanuma too performed a great feat in the great
battle."
"In the course of three days and nights, the valiant Indrajit was felled down
somehow. Now, I have been made free of enemies. Hearing of his son having been struck down, Ravana
will indeed come forth with a great and powerful battle-array."
"By encircling that Ravana, who is difficult to be conquered, with a great army, I
will kill him, who is coming forth with a feeling of distress for the death of his son."
"O Lakshmana! As that Indrajit has been killed in battle by you, who are my
protector, neither Seetha nor this entire earth is hard to attain."
Having thus consoled Lakshmana and having embraced him, that Rama who was born in
Raghu-dynansty, was duly delighted and by calling Sushena, spoke to him the following words:
"O highly intelligent one! You attend upon this wounded Lakshmana, who is fond of
frinds, so that he will become perfectly well in health."
Let Lakshmana along with Vibhishana be quickly made free from pain caused by the
arrows that have penetrated into their body. Let all others too among the gallant bear and
monkey-warriors fighting with trees who have fought on the battle-field here and stand pierced with
arrows and owunded, be healed in the same way with great care."
As commanded by Rama, the great-souled Sushena, the monkey-cheif gave an excellent
medicine through nose to Lakshmana.
Inhaling the odour of that herb, Lakshmana became healed of the arrow-wounds, free
from pains and his wounds got completely cured.
As per the order of Rama, Sushena then treated his companions like Vibhishana and
others including all the monkey-chiefs.
Then, with his arrow-wounds healed, his fatigue gone and his feverishness cured
within a moment, Lakshmana having restored his original disposition, felt joyful there.
Then, on seeing Lakshmana standing up with sound health, Rama, Sugreeva, Vibhishana
and the valiant Jambavan along with the army were rejoiced for a long time.
That great-souled Rama apllauded the ardous feat of Lakshmana. Hearing of Indrajit
having been kille din battle, Sugreeva became delighted.Seeing his own army making a tumultuous sound tottering with excessive fear, seeing
his brothers having a prowess equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials having been killed, and
seeing his paternal uncles as also Yuddhonmatta and Matta (Mahodara and Mahaparshva) his brothers
and the foremost of demons having been fallen down, Atikaya of great splendour, having boons
bestowed by Brahma the lord of creation, having appearance of a mountain and who removed the pride
of celestials and ogres, was enraged.
That Atikaya, the enemy of Indra the lord of celestials, mounting a chariot shining
like a cluster of thousand suns, ran towards the monkeys.
Wearing a crown and well-cleansed ear-rings as also drawing his bow, he roared with
a big noise, making his name loudly heard.
By that lion-like roar, making his name loudly heard and by that terrific sound of
the bow-string, it created terror to the monkeys.
Seeing the bulkiness of his body, all the monkeys, thinking that Kumbhakarna woke up
again, took refuge with each other, afflicted as they were, with fear.
Seeing his form appearing like Vishnu who strided over the three worlds in three
steps, the those renowned monkey-warriors with fear, ran away hither and thither.
When Atikaya was to be attacked, the monkeys were bewildered in mind and sought in
the battle, a refuge with Rama, who affords protection.
Then, Rama saw from a distance, Atikaya, who resembled a mountain in size, stationed
in a chariot, armed with a bow and rumbling like a cloud appearing at the time of universal
dissolution.
Seeing that Atikaya, having a colossal body, Rama for his part was quite surprised
and after consoling the monkeys, spoke to Vibhishana (as follows):
"Who is he, resembling a mountain in size, armed with a bow, brown-eyed and seated
in a spacious chariot yoked with a thousand horses?"
He is shining like Lord Shiva surrounded by genii, with resplendent and sharp
spikes, with very sharply barbed javelins and lances.
"He is shining like a lightening cloud and moving round with staffs which support
the banners of the war-chariot, appearing like tongues of the Time-Sprit."
"Bows adhered with golden backs in his excellent chariot are shining on all sides
like a rainbow in the sky."
"That warrior of demons, the eminent of charioteers, making the battle-front to
shine, is coming in a chariot with the splendour of the sun, with arrows having gleams of
sun-beams, shining in ten directions and embellishing brilliance by an emblem of Rahu installed on
the point of his standard."
"His triply curved, golden backed and decorated bow, having a rumbling sound of the
cloud, is shining like a rain-bow."
"His large chariot, with its flag and emblem, with its axle-tree at the bottom, and
having the sound of a cloud's lightning, consists of four charioteers."
Twenty quivers, ten terrific bows and eight bow-strings, golden and reddish brown in
colour, are abiding in his chariot."
"On that chariot are hanging two swords, clearly measuring ten cubits in length and
provided with measuring four cubits, casting their splendour on his two sides."
"This brave warrior, with a red garland adorning his neck, resembling a large
mountain black in colour and having a month as large as Death, looks like the sun veiled by a
cloud."
"With his arms adorned with gold armlets, he shines like the Himalaya, the highest
mountain with its two lofty peaks."
"His awfully dreadful face, with two ear-rings, is shining like a full moon
appearing between the two stars constituting the constellation, Punnarvasu."
"O the long armed! Tell me who this foremost of demons is! On seeing him all the
monkeys, afflicted with fear, are running away in different directions."
Thus asked by Rama, the prince having an unlimited splendour, that Vibhishana of
great brilliance, replied to Rama as follows:
"The ten-necked king Ravana, having great brilliance, the brother of Kubera the lord
of wealth, doing terrific deeds and possessing a great power, is the lord of demons."
"To him, there is a valiant son, equal to Ravana in combat, who serves elders,
holding that which is heard from them and skilled in the use of weaponry."
"He is respected for his counsel, for his rides on the backs of horses and
elephants, for his drawing out of the sword and the bow, for his strategy winning over to his side
by sowing dissention negotiation and bribery and for his steering capacity of an army.
"He is Atikaya, the son of Dhanyamali. Lanka is feeling fearless, by resting on his
arm."
"He, who purified his soul by meditating on the universal soul, worshipped Brahma
the lord of creation, obtained missiles too and conquered the enemies.
"Brahma, the lord of creation, granted a boon, exempting him from death at the hands
of celestials and demons as also this wonderful armour and the chariot shining like the sun."
"He conquered the celestials and the ogres several times, destroyed Yakshas the
supernatural beings and defended the demons."
"He is Atikaya, who paralyzed the thunderbolt of the intelligent Indra with his
arrows. He struck down the noose of Varuna, the seizer of transgressors. This wise Ravana's son,
who is strong and the foremost of demons took off the pride of celestials and ogres."
"O Rama, the foremost of men! Therefore let the effort to destroy him be made
quickly. Otherwise shortly, he will bring in destruction for our army of monkeys, with his
arrows."
Entering the army of monkeys, the strong Atikaya then stretched his bow and roared
again and again.
Seeing him with a terrific body, seated in the chariot, as the excellent one among
the charioteers, powerful chiefs of monkeys rushed towards him.
Taking trees and mountain peaks, Kumuda, Dvivida, Mainda, Nila and Sharabha marched
forwards quickly to attack him at once.
Atikaya of great splendour, the foremost among those skilled in weaponry, chopped
off their trees and crags with his arrows decked with gold.
That strong and skilled Atikaya with a terrific body, struck all those monkeys,
facing in front of him in battle with arrows fully made of iron.
Those overthrown monkeys, injured with their blown out bodies, by the shower of
Atikaya's arrows in that great battle, were unable to retaliate on him.
That demon, who was arrogant of his youth, frightened that army of monkey-warriors,
as an enraged lion frightens a herd of deers.
That chief of demons did not strike whomsoever of the monkey-warriors who were
unable to fight. That Atikaya, with his bow and quiver of arrows, going up quickly towards Rama,
spoke haughty words (to him) as follows:
"I am seated in the chariot with arrows and a bow in my hand. I would not give
battle with any common warrior. He who has ability and energy can give his fight to me now and here
quickly."
Hearing his words, Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies was enraged. Then, unable to
bear his words and smiling, he rose up quickly and took up his bow.
The enraged Lakshmana, coming forward quickly and taking off an arrow from his
quiver pulled out his great bow in front of Atikaya.
That twang of the bow of Lakshmana, filling the entire quarters, earth, sky and the
ocean, was angry, frightening the demons.
Hearing the terrific twang of Lakshmana's bow, the strong Atikaya of great
splendour, was surprised.
Seeing Lakshmana standing in front of him for the battle, Atikaya then was enraged
and taking a sharp arrow, spoke the following words:
"O Lakshmana! You are still a boy. You are ignorant of a fight. Why do you wish to
fight with me, who is like Yama the Lord of Death? Go away."
"Even the Himalayan Mountains or the sky or the earth would be unable to endure the
speed of arrows released by my arms."
"You wish to arouse a fire of dissolution, when it is sleeping happily. Placing your
bow here, go back. Do not lose your life, by fighting against me."
"If you do not go back, with an obstinance, then you rather stay back. Abandoning
your lives, you will reach the abode of Yama."
"See my sharp arrows decked with pure gold, which can remove the pride of my enemies
and which are like the weapons of Ishvara the lord of destruction."
"This arrow looking like a serpent will drink your blood as a lion drinks the blood
of an elephant. "Thus speaking, Atikaya was enraged and fixed an arrow on his bow.
Hearing the words of Atikaya, filled with anger and arrogance in that battle-field,
Lakshmana was enraged. Thereafter, that Lakshmana, having a great strength wisdom and great glory,
also spoke as follows:
"O the evil-minded! Just by uttering mere words, you cannot by a very important
person. People cannot become good persons, just by boasting of themselves. You rather show your
strength in me, who is standing with an arrow in hand and wielding a bow."
"Reveal yourself by your deeds. You do not deserve to boast of yourself. A person
with valour alone is declared as a warrior."
"You are seated in a chariot, with all the weaponry and wielding a bow. Show your
prowess either by your arrows or even by your weapons."
"Thereupon, with sharp arrows, I shall strike down your head like a fruit of a
fan-palm, ripened by its time, is fallen down from its stalk by the gust of a wind."
"Today, these arrows of mine decked with pure gold, will drink blood oozing forth
from the holes formed in your body by the sharp points of my arrows."
"Thinking me to be a boy, you need not disregard me. Either as the boy or as the
aged, you indeed know me in battle-front as the god of Death. Vishnu, as a boy occupied the three
worlds just with his three strides, Didn't he?"
Hearing the reasonable and highly meaningful words of Lakshmana, Atikaya was very
much enraged and took out an excellent arrow.
Then, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Bhutas the spirits, Devas the celestials,
Daityas the demons, Maharshies the great sages and Guhyakas a class of demi-gods, all the great
souled ones saw that battle.
Thereafter, the enraged Atikaya, stringing an arrow to his bow, dispatched it
towards Lakshmana, as though he were shrinking up the space in between.
Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemy-warriors, chopped off that serpent-like sharp
arrow, which was falling down on him, with his crescent-pointed arrow.
Seeing that arrow which was chopped off as a snake's hood severed into pieces,
Atikaya was very much enraged and fitted five arrows to his bow.
That demon hurled those arrows towards Lakshmana. Even before they reached him,
Lakshmana chopped them off with his sharp arrows.
Cutting off those arrows with his sharp arrows that Lakshmana, the destroyer of
enemy-warriors, took up a sharp arrow, as though it was blazing with a glow.
Taking that arrow, Lakshmana harnessed it on his excellent bow, stretched it with
force and released it.
That valiant Lakshmana, by a flat-jointed arrow released fully, struck it on the
forehead of that excellent demon.
That arrow, sunken into the forehead of that terrible demon, smeared with blood,
appeared like a serpent-king on a mountain.
The demon, tormented by Lakshmana's arrow, then trembled violently as when the
terrific town-gate of Tripura City, (built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth by
Maya for the demons) was struck by Shiva's arrow.
That demon of great strength, recovering his breath, reasoningly reflected as
follows: "Well! By flying down an arrow, you have become a commendable enemy for me."
Thus speaking with his mouth wide open, Atikaya bent down with his large shoulder,
ascended the top of his chariot and roamed about hither and thither by his chariot.
Atikaya, the foremost of demons, seized hold of one, three, five and seven arrows
and fixed them to his bow, stretched it and released the arrows.
Those arrows, released from the bow of Atikaya, the leader of demons, appearing as
Death, with golden shafts and shining like the sun, set the sky ablaze.
Thereupon, Lakshmana coolly chopped off those gluts of arrows released by that
foremost of demons, by the multitude of his sharp arrows.
That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantly
releasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest.
That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantly
releasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest.
Struck in battle by Atikaya in his chest, Lakshmana oozed out blood severely, like
the fluid exuding from a rutting elephant.
That powerful Lakshmana, then quickly made himself freed from that arrow-head, took
up a sharp arrow and fixed it with a missile.
When Lakshmana employed the missile of fire on his arrow, that arrow of the great
souled Lakshmana and as also the bow, caused a flame to blaze.
Atikaya of great splendour took up a solar missile and employed it on that arrow,
having a golden shaft as also looking like a serpent.
Meanwhile, Lakshmana hurled at Atikaya, that blazing and awful arrow employed with
that mystic missile as Yama the lord of Death would hurl his rod of destruction.
Seeing that arrow charged with a mystic missile of fire, Atikaya the demon then
released the awful arrow charged with the solar missile.
Those two arrows, having their points blazed in splendour, struck at each other in
the sky, like two enraged serpents.
Those two excellent arrows, eventhough they were both blazing, did not radiate any
longer on the earth's surface, in that they were without a flame and had been reduced to ashes.
Thereupon, the enraged Atikaya released an arrow made of cane (a missile) presided
over by Tvasha (the architect of gods). Then, the valiant LakShmana chopped off that missile, by
his missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials.
Seeing his arrow made of cane struck down, that young Atikaya was quite enraged and
fixed his arrow with a missile presided over by Yama the lord of retribution.
Thereupon, Atikaya hurled that missile on Lakshmana. That Lakshmana struck it down
by a missile presided over by the wind-god.
Then, the furious Lakshmana showered forth hails of arrows on Atikaya, as a rainy
cloud showers hails of down-pour.
Reaching Atikaya, those arrows with the points of their shafts shattered on his
armour, adorned with diamonds and instantly fell on the earth's surface.
Seeing those arrows becoming unsuccessful, the highly famous Lakshmana the
annihilator of enemy-warriors, showered forth arrows in thousands.
Atikaya, that mighty demon, though deluged with a flood of arrows, was not agitated
in battle because of the inviolability of his armour.
Atikaya released an arrow having a serpent-like form on Lakshmana. Struck by that
arrow on his vital parts, that Lakshmana, the tormentator of his enemies, felt unconscious just for
a moment.
Having regained his consciousness, the mighty Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemies,
with his flood of arrows threw down the flag-staff and killed the horses and the charioteer in
combat, with his four excellent arrows.
Free from flurry, that Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, released those arrows, exactly
aiming at that demon, for the purpose of killing him.
Lakshmana, the best among men, was not able to afflict any injury to Atikaya in
battle. Then, the wind-god came to him and spoke to him as follows:
"He, endowed with a boon by Brahma the lord of creation, is cloaked by inviolable
armour. Split him with a missile of Brahma. He cannot be killed by any other means. The mighty
Atikaya, with that armour, cannot be destroyed by other missiles."
Then, hearing the words of the wind-god, Lakshmana having a prowess equal to that of
Indra the lord of celestials, adjusting his arrow with a missile presided over by Vrahma, quickly
directed the arrow with a terrific force.
While fixing that excellent missile on that superior sharp-pointed arrow by
Lakshmana, all the quarters, the sun, the moon, the great planets and the sky were frightened.
Earth also made an uproar.
Having charged the missile of Brahma on that arrow with the feathers and all, equal
to a messenger of Yama the lord of Death over his bow, Lakshmana released that arrow looking like a
thunderbolt on Atikaya, the son of Ravana.
Atikaya saw that arrow, released with augmented force by Lakshmana, moving so fastly
as the wind, having beautiful wings with variegated feathers and looking like a thunderous
thunderbolt, approaching him in battle.
Seeing that arrow, Atikaya quickly struck with several sharp arrows. That
Lakshmana's arrow, with a speed equal to Garuda the eagle, thus reached Atikaya's proximity.
Seeing that blazing arrow, looking like Yama the lord of Death and black in colour,
approaching him, Atikaya then struck it with spike, spear, mace, axe and arrows.
Then, that arrow, blazing like fire, made in vain those weapons of wonderful form
and taking Atikaya's head, carried it away.
That head with its diadem, chopped off by Lakshmana, quickly fell down on the
ground, like a peak of the Himalayan Mountain.
Seeing Atikaya falling on the ground, with his clothes and ornaments scattered away,
all the surviving demons became perturbed.
Many of those depressed demons, dejected as they were, showing fatigue born of
fighting, in their faces, suddenly began to shout loudly, with their voices in discordant
notes.
As their leader was dead, the demons were then frightened and becoming indifferent
to fight, went running away all around, with their faces turned towards that City of Lanka.
When the dangerous demon with the terrific strength was killed, the multitude of
monkeys then were endowed with a great delight, with their faces looking like full blown lotuses
and worshipped Lakshmana who got his desire fulfilled.
Throwing down in battle, that Atikaya who was exceedingly strong and looking like a
cloud, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and while he was being worshipped by the multitude of
monkeys, thereupon quickly hastened towards the proximity of Rama.Lakshmana on seeing Rama who is searing and careworn owing to the abduction of
Seetha, blazing like the doomsday inferno, twinned with the notion of rendering the worlds into
nonentity, kenning at his stringed bow, keen to blaze away entire universe, suspiring again and
again, and who is alike Rudra at the end of era, and whose highly infuriated persona Lakshmana has
not seen previously, became pale-faced and spoke to Rama with folded palms. 
"Previously, you were self-collected and self-controlled and delighted in the
wellbeing of all the beings. But presently, slipping into fury you are discarding your own
disposition, which is unapt of you... 
"Grandeur in moon, splendour in sun, motion in wind, and composure in earth are
perpetual and all this perpetuity is available in you, besides an unexcelled honour... 
"It will be unapt of you to vandalise worlds for a single-soul's felony. It is
unclear as to whose combat-chariot is this, or by whom, or by what reason it is shattered with its
weaponry and paraphernalia... 
"This has become a very ghastly place since it is grooved by the hooves of ungulates
and by the felloies of chariot-wheels, and it is wetted with drops of blood, oh, prince, thereby a
combat is fought and stalled at this place... 
"This is just a solo-combatant's combat but not among duo, oh, best articulator one
among best articulators, I indeed observe that no huge army is eventuated here, nor its stamp...

"It will be inapt of you to wish for wrecking a havoc upon all worlds for an
individual's wrongdoing. Why because, the good-hearted, good-natured kings are they who impose
tenable punishment... 
"You are always the shelterer for all beings, for you're above all the good-natured
and good-hearted ordinary kings, and who can really deem the ravagement of you wife as an act of
grace... 
"As no altruist can evoke indignation in a hallowed person who is performing
Vedic-ritual, honestly, these rivers, oceans, mountains, gods, celestials, and cacodemons too
cannot evoke indignation in you, because they are always gentle to you... isn't so... 
"Oh, king, it will be apt of you to wield your bow and search for him who abducted
Seetha, along with me as your squire and standby, and with the help of sublime sages available in
this forest... 
"Let us search the oceans, rivers and forests, and even divers dreadful caves and
different lotus-lakes... 
"Let us intently search the worlds of gods and celestials as long as the abductor of
your wife is unapprehended... 
"Oh, Lord of Kosala kingdom, if the heavenly lords are not going bestow your wife
propitiously, rather after our humanly effort, then you may do whatever you want, seasonably...

"If, oh, king, you with your traits of sincerity, solidarity, simplicity, and
scrupulosity are not going to get back Seetha, then you may you may put whole of the universe to
turmoil with the torrents of your arrows which have swift egress as they are with golden-handles
which are stuffed with eagle feathers, and which mirror up the Thunderbolts of Mahendra in their
trajectories..." Thus Lakshmana appealed to ireful Rama. Rama then voicing clearly and softly spoke to her, whom the noose of lust has tethered down, with a 
smile preceding his words. 
"Oh, honourable one, I am married and this is my dear wife, thus it will be distressing for your sort 
of females to live with a co-wife. 
"He is my younger brother named Lakshmana, he is with a good conduct, good looking, a promising and 
valiant one, and he is without a wife. 
"He is without a wife and in need of a wife  he is youthful, good-looking and he can become a fitly 
husband of yours, fit enough to your kind of features. 
"You woo him, oh, board-eyed  one, this brother of mine as your husband like sunshine seeking 
the Mt. Meru, then oh, great-waisted  one, you will be without a co-wife " So said Rama 
to that demoness. 
When Rama clearly told that way to that demoness dazed in lust, discarding Rama quickly then she spoke 
to Lakshmana. 
"I with my best complexion will be your deserving wife meetly to you charm, you can happily take a jaunt 
all over Dandaka forest along with me." So Shuurpanakha ran after Lakshmana. 
Thus said by the demoness that meaningful sentence maker Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, then smiled 
and appropriately replied Shuurpanakha. 
"How you wish to become a female servant, oh,  lotus-coloured one, by becoming the wife of a 
servant like me? I am just a vassal of my adorable brother. 
"Oh, goggle eyed one, befitting to your complexion that is un-stainable further you better become the 
wife of my brother Rama who is abounding in means, and on becoming the younger wife of that adorable 
one, you too will achieve your means and thus you will be happy. 
"On discarding her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolically deleterious old wife with a hallow stomach 
that Rama will adore you alone. 
"Oh, best complexioned one with best waist, is there any wiseacre to simply discard your kind of best 
personality, indeed, in preference to human females?" Lakshmana said so to Shuurpanakha. 
Thus said by Lakshmana that despicable one with slouching stomach Shuurpanakha presumed those words 
to be truthful, for she is equivocal of that equivoque. 
She who is fuddle by lust said to that unassailable enemy scorcher Rama who is sitting in the cottage 
along with Seetha. 
"Tenacious of her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolical, hallow-stomached old wife of yours you are 
not regarding me high. 
"Now I wish to eat up this human female right before your very eyes, and then I can blithely make merry 
along with you, without the botheration of a co-wife." Said Shuurpanakha to Rama. 
Speaking that way she that torch-eyed Shuurpanakha dashed towards the deer-eyed Seetha in high exasperation 
as a great meteor would dash towards Rohini, the brightest star in the sky. 
By that the great-energetic Rama took umbrage and checking her who is like the noose of death swooping 
down on Seetha said to Lakshmana. 
"Punning in any way with the base and brutish is inapposite, oh, gentle Saumitri, mark note of Vaidehi, 
somehow surviving  
"She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this 
paunchy demoness " Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. 
Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before 
the very eyes of Rama. 
On hewing off her ears and nose she that ghastly Shuurpanakha blared highly and discordantly, and very 
speedily fled into forest as she came. 
She that very ghastly demoness when defaced is wetted by blood and blared many a blare like a cloud 
in cloudburst. 
She that gruesome one in her appearance clasped herself and thunderously entered similarly gruesome 
forest while her blood fountained and profusely exuded. 
Then she who is deformed neared her brother Khara who possess violent vigour, who is abiding in Janasthaana 
and who is presently surrounded by his band of his hench-demons, and before him she that Shuurpanakha 
fell onto ground like a thunderbolt from the sky. 
Then that sister of Khara who is convulsed in the fluster of fear and her body wetted with blood reported 
to her brother Khara, all about Rama's arrival in forest with his wife and Lakshmana, and even about 
his misshaping her. Lakshmana who came there earlier, heard the conversation of Seetha and Rama, having his eyes glut with tears, being unable to bear the anguish, tightly pressed the feet of his bother and spoke (as floows) to Rama who was performing a great vow and to Seetha who enjoyed great honour.
"If you decided to go to the forest filled with antelopes and elephants, I, in front wearingthe bow, shall accompany you to the forest."
"Together with me, you will travel in the various forests, resonant with sounds of birds and herds of wild animals."
"Without you, I do not want ascendency to heaven now do I desire immortality now do I wish for sovereignity over the globes."
Lakshmana who was speaking in favour of coming to the forst, was forbidden by Rama through many of his pacifying words. After hearing them, Lakshmana again soke as follows:
"I was indeed permitted by you earlier. How is it that you are prohibiting me
now?"
"Oh, the faultless man! I desire to know the reason for prohibiting me, who is
indeed willing to come to the forest, because there is doubt in my mind."
Thereafter Rama of great splendour spoke to Lakshmana the valiant man who was
standing in front, intending to preceede Sri Rama and soliciting with joined palms.
"You are so friendly, interested in righteousness, valiant, abiding always in a good path, dear to me as life, obedient, my brother and a companion."
"Oh Lakshmana! If you proceed to the forest along with me now, who will support
Kausalya or the illustrious Sumitra?"
"That emperor of great splendour, who used to shower blessings on the people as a
cloud sends down rain on the earth, stands circumscribed by cord of love."
"That Kaikeyi daughter of king Aswapathi, after obtaining this kingdom, will
certainly not accord good treatment to her step-wives, who are at grief."
"Bharata on acquiring the kingdom will be devoted to Kaikeyi and will not think of sorrowful Kausalya or Sumitra."
"Oh, Lakshmana! You stay here and support the venerable Kausalya through your own
self or by obtaining favour through the king. Do this thing, as said."
"Oh, Lakshmana the knower of righteousness! Thus, your devotion towards me will have been fully demonstrated by you. By honouring the elders, a great unqualled religious merit will accrue to you."
"Oh, Lakshmana, the exhilarator of Raghu dynasty! Do this for my sake. There will be no happiness to our mother, if she is left behind by us."
Lakshmana who is intelligent in speech, after hearing Rama's words, replied in a
gentle voice to him who is skilled in speech.
"Oh, Rama the valiant! Bharata being inspired by your splendour of morality will
respect Kausalya and Sumitra. There is no doubt in this matter."
"Kausalya obtained (by grant) thousand villages , which are dependent on her. Hence, that venerable Kausalya can maintain even thousand people like me."
"The illustrious Kausalya is competent not only to maintain herself but also my
mother and people like me in addition."
"Make me your attendant. In this, there is no unrighteousness. Besides, I will be
accomplishing my object. Your purpose also will be fulfilled."
"Taking my bow and arrows and carrying a spade and a basket, I will walk in front of you showing the path."
"I will procure for you for all time the tubers, fruits and other things which are good food stuffs available in the forest for sages."
"You along with Seetha enjoy yourself on mountain-ridges. I shall do everything
while you are waking or sleeping."
Rama, very much delighted of hearing these words, said to him: "Oh, Lakshmana! Go, take leave of all your friends."
"Oh, Lakshma! At a grand sacrifice perfomed by Janaka, the great-souled Varuna(god of water) personally gave heavently bows which are dreadful to look at, divine impenetrable pices of armour, quivers containing an inexhanstible stock of arms, two swords decked with gold and with spotless lustre like that of a sun - all these were kept at the residence of our receptor Vasista, after paying due reverence. Take all those arms and return soon."
Lakshmana, who was assured of his sojourn in the forest, after bidding good bye ot his friends, approached Vasista the preceptor of Ikshvaku dynasty and took the excellent armoury.
Lakshmana, a tiger among princes, showed to Rama all those arms, which were divine, being worshipped and decorated by garlands.
Rama, who had fully controlled his mind, affectionately spoke as follows to
Lakshmana who arrived: "Oh, Lakshmana, the excellent man! You came in time as desired by me."
"Lakshmana, the chastiser of foes! along with you, I want to give all this wealth
pertaining to me to brahmanas, practising ansterities."
"I also desire to give to those excellent brahmanas residing here as strong devotees to their proceptors and to all my dependents."
"You bring boon the venerable Suyagna, the son of Vasista, the best. After adoring all other brahmanas also who are cultured, I will go to the forest."
On seeing the illustrious Lakshmana who entered unimpededly and infuriated,
Sugreeva became one with agitated senses. 
On seeing Lakshmana, the son of Dasharatha, who is exasperated and exhaling heavily,
and who searing in the anguish of his brother is flaring up like a firestorm, Sugreeva hopped up
from his golden seat and tottered like the highly decorated flagstaff of Indra, which will be
wobbly before it is thrown to the ground after the ritual. 
While Sugreeva is jumping up stumblingly, stumbled with him are Ruma and the other
females in tow, who are so far clinging to him, like the clusters of stars that spring up on the
emergence of the full moon in the sky. 
That fortunate Sugreeva whose eyes are bloodshot with drinking flurried towards
Lakshmana adjoined palms in supplication, and became standstill at his nearby, like a loftykalpa rikshaws-fulfilling tree. 
Infuriate Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva who like the star-clustered moon is standing
with his wife Ruma at his side amid other vanara females. 
"One who is dynamic, abounding with best troopers, sympathetic, senses conquered, a
faithful one and an advocate of truth, he alone thrives as a king in the world. 
"He who is enthroned as a king but anchored himself to dishonesty and makes fake
assurances to helpful friends, who can be more ruthless than him? 
"A person gets attached to the sin of killing of a hundred of his manes, deified
souls of his ancestors, if he promises to gift one horse but fails to do so, and in promising
to gift one cow but failing in it he gets the sin of killing a thousand manes, and if he promises
to a person to do the needful help and fails in rendering that help, then he gets the sin of
suicide along with the sin of killing his kith and kin. 
"He who gets his means fulfilled earlier through his friends but does not require
them, oh, king of monkeys, such a treacherous one is eliminable for all beings. 
"On seeing such perfidious soul, oh, fly-jumper, Brahma irefully declared this verse
which is reverenced by all the worlds, you too may know it. 
" 'The savants have ordained atonement for slayers of cows, for drinkers of liquors,
thus for thieves and infringers of solemnity, but no atonement is available to a treacherous
person. 
"Oh, Vanara, firstly you have got your purpose fulfilled and for that reason you are
not reciprocating help to Rama, thereby you are an uncultured and unfriendly one, and illusive is
your word of honor. 
"Oh, Vanara, you achieved your means through Rama, and Rama is wishing for his
endeavor through you, and I wonder whether the search for Seetha is not your duty? 
"An illusive promisor basking in churlish pleasures, such as you are, Rama has not
realized that you are a serpent with the croaking of a frog. 
"By the highly prudent and compassionate Rama, you the sinner got the kingdom of
monkeys and it is a gain of an evil soul from a noble soul. 
"If you do not recognize what the noble-souled Raghava has done to you, you will be
instantly killed with incisive arrows enabling you to see Vali. 
"Oh, Sugreeva, abide by your commitment. The path by which slain Vali has gone that
the path is not tapered off, as such do not tread Vali's path. 
"You are not envisaging the Thunderbolt similar arrows from the bow of
the best one from the Ikshvaku dynasty, Rama, thereby you are enjoying luxuries joyously without giving
a thought to Rama's mission even at your heart. While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered
impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of
Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. 
"Oh, Rama, as gods have reaped ambrosia after a prolonged churning of Milky Ocean,
you are a reap of King Dasharatha's superlative ascesis and even by his superior acts...

"Our father was an enlivener of all the subjects and that king was beholden only to
your rosy endowments, but he obtained godhood by your separation... this is what we heard from
Bharata... 
"If you are unable to withstand this anguish chanced on you, oh, Kakutstha, then how
a simpleton and whose boldness is meagre can withstand it... 
"Oh, first and foremost man, tell me who is uncaught by mischance, which mischance
will be catchy like fire-catch, and oh, king, even that, that lets up momently... 
"If you are going to blaze away worlds with your radiance in your ruefulness, to
where the ordinary people in rue shall go for solace, really... 
"World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has become
an egalitarian with Indra, writhe touched him off... 
"Which great sage Vashishta is there, who is also the priest of our father, he
parented a hundred sons in one day and like that they are all eliminated in one day by Vishvamitra,
for which Vashishta also lamented, but not for a long... 
"This Mother Earth who is the mother of worlds and venerated by all animate and
inanimate, or even celestial beings, oh, king of Kosala kingdom, even she undergoes tremors and
earthquakes... 
"Which duteous pair is the pair of eyes of the world in whom all the systems of
world are peremptory, though that pair of Sun and Moon are doughtily influential in this solar
system, eclipse draws nigh of them... 
"Even very great incorporates like earth and suchlike planets, oh, bullish man, or
even the gods, or even all corporeal beings, cannot get release from the predestine of Supreme
Being... 
"Oh, tigerly-man, we hear that whether gods like Indra et al., are ethical and/or
unethical, yet they too have the resultant agonies and ecstasies... hence, it is inapt of you to
fret thyself... 
"Whether Vaidehi is stolen or slain, oh, brave one, it will be inapt of you sadden
like this as with any other commoner without tracking her whereabouts... 
"Persons of your like who are always equable in their outlook, oh, Rama, they will
remain non-dispirited even if they are undergoing desperate straits, and they will not just sadden
like this... 
"Oh, foremost man among men, you ratiocinate in subtle pursuit, objectively and
brainily, and great brains will comprehend good and bad in subtlety with their braininess...

"Indiscernible are the rights and wrongs of actions, and indefinite are the
cherished fruits of those actions, and without performing any action, fruits also will be
nonexistent... 
"The great brains with their braininess are clearly comprehending the indiscernible,
indefinite or infirm rights and wrongs of their actions, thus they translate their thinking into
action... and thus they are undertaking humanly possible action... but not sitting back, unlike
you...
Oh, brave one, to those that are interested in endeavours, whether or not they are
uninterested in the results of their actions, either rights or wrongs, but even to them cherished
fruits does not occur, effortlessly...
"Oh valiant one, indeed you alone have said this way to me previously and
repeatedly, who really can profess you even he were to be professedly the Jupiter... 
"Oh, great discerner, your thinking process is non-explicatory even to gods, but now
that thinking process is obliquely and utterly slumberous owing to your sadness, hence I am
addressing your percipience and this is no schoolteaching... 
"Oh, foremost one among Ikshvaku, oh, Rama, contemplate the divineness of those
immortals and their pure being in maintaining world order, also consider the humanness of these
mortals and their helpless susceptibility to pain, also count on your own valour that which can
annihilate the whole of anything... and then come to conclusion whether or not to annihilate
everything... but, before that try hard to eliminate the abuser, lest he may abuse many others...

"Oh, best one among Ikshvaku-s, oh, Rama, contemplate the divine valour you have
derived, also consider the human valour you have inherited, also count on your own innate valour...
hence, try hard to eliminate the abuser...
"Oh, best one among men, what is it you gain on performing a complete annihilation
owing to a single soul's malefaction, hence, mark him... that malefactor and a malevolent of yours,
and it will be apt of you to uproot him... him alone... While Rama was thus speeding, Lakshmana heard, bowed down his head and got into the midst of pain and pleasure effecting his mind again and again.
Lakshmana then firmed up his eyebrows and sighed with frown, like an angry snake
from its hole.
His wickedly looking face with eyebrows contracted, then appeared like the face of an angry lion.
Seeing Rama with the tip of his eyes obliquely, Lakshmana spoke to him moving his
forehand like an elephant moving its trunk and causing his head to fall in oblique and upward direction.
"Oh, the best of proud military community! This untimely great confusion is born in you due to your conjecture of quilty righteousness and of non suspicion of the world. Can such a person like you speak a person like you speak thus doubtlessly of the powerless destiny?"
"Why are you speaking about this weak and pitiable destiny? Why are you not doubting the sinful Kaikeyi and Dasaratha?"
"Oh, the righteous sould! Both of them are smoothly deceiving in the name of
righteousness with an intent to keep away your good conduct, with selfish away your good conduct, with selfish motive and by dishonest means. You are not knowing."
"Oh, Rama! If it was not indeed an earlier decision taken long ago by both of them, the boon must have been given naturally even long ago."
"Enthroning other than yourself is not to the liking of the people. I cannot
tolerate this act that is started. Excuse me in this matter."
"Oh, Rama the great minded! This righteousness by which your intellect got disunited and by which indulgence, you are stupefied, is disliked by me."
"you are capable of doing retaliatory action. How can you act on the word which is reprehensible and which is unjustified of your father who is surrendering obediently to the will of Kaikeyi?"
"Though they are doing this treachery with a sinful intent, I regret that you are
not grasping it. Such a conduct is to be censured."
"But of them, action on their own free will, were never desirous of your welfare.
They are enemies in the name of parents. It is not proper even to think of fulfilling their desire."
"It may be your opinion that their action is influenced by mere destiny. Even then, I do not like you to be indifferent to this also."
"Only a confused and cowardly person depends upon destiny. Brave men with
self-respect do not honour the destiny."
"That person who is capable of keeping off destiny by human effort, does not have
regret in the sense of not being failed by destiny."
"Today, all can see how much prowess is there in destiny and in man. This day, the distinction between man and the destiny will be clearly perceived."
"By which destiny, your coronation is seen crushed, I shall crush that destiny by my prowess. Let all people see it!"
"By my prowess, I shall turn back this destiny, as framing back an elephant which is not caring a hook and which is fiercely running with violent force."
"Neither all the guardians of the world nor the three worlds put together can
withhold Rama's coronation today. Why to talk about father."
"Oh, King! Those who are secritlyadvocating you to live in a forest for fourteen
years, will have to reside in forest for fourteen years in that manner."
"That is why, I shall break down the hope of father and of Kaikeyi, who is trying
for kingdom to her son by creating obstacle to your coronation."
"The strength of destiny cannot create that much pain as that which my terrific
prowess will create to those who are opposed to my strength."
"At the end of a thousand years of your ruling the kingdom, you having gone to the forest, your sons will govern the kingdom."
"It is indeed a practice for ancient kings to go to the forest after keeping care of people, to be nourished as children, into the hands of their sons."
"If you think that you do not want kingdom because of your doubt that the kingdom
will get disturbed due to unstable mind of king Dasaratha, you need not fear. I am promising you. I shall protect the kingdom as a sea coast protects the sea. If not, I will not obtain the heroic world of heaven."
"You become engaged in getting coronated with auspicious things. I for one is
competent to ward off the kings by force."
"My arms are not meant for handsomeness alone. Bow is not for decoration. Sword is not for tying around waist. Arrows are not for staying immobile. All these four are intended for subduing enemies."
"I do not wish to tolerate too much the one who is considered as enemy to me. By
wearing a sword with sharp edge which is mavingly bright like lightening, I do not care any enemy, even Indra himself. This earth will become impermeable, uninhabited with heads hands and thighs of elephants horses and men crushed, having been hit by my sword."
"Now, elephants can fall down on earth, being hit by the gush of my sword, like
mountains in blaze, like clouds, savidyutaH = with flashes of lightening.
"As I stand holding a bow with fingers wound with shields made of allegator-skin,
how any man will fancy himself a hero among men?"
"While I overpower one with many arrows and many with a single arrow, I discharge my arrows at vitals of men, horses and elephants."
"Oh, Lord! Today, the strength of my excellent arrows is capable of making you
sovereign and making Dasaratha devoid of power."
" Oh, Lord Rama! Today the effect of my weapons will remove the power from the king Dasaratha and give the lordship to you."
"Oh, Rama! These arms worthy of wearing sandalwood essence and bracelets; for
bestowing riches and for protection of friends can today do every action to prevent the agents who want to obstruct your coronation."
"Tell me now itself who your enemy be made deprived of life, honour and friendship, by me. Command me so that how this earth will become your dominion. I am your servant.
Then, Rama spoke thus to Lakshmana after consoling him time and again by weeping off his tears; "Oh, Lakshmana! I stand by the words of our father. This indeed is a good path."
Pleasanthemantha R^itu, pre-winter season has set in after the passage ofsharat R^itu, 
post-rainy season at Panchavati where the noble souled Rama is staying comfortably. 
On some day when night faded into dawn Rama started for the delightful River Godavari for a bath. 
His valorous brother Saumitri following him humbly with a handy vessel, along with Seetha, spoke this 
to Rama. 
"Adorned by which season the promising year will be bright, oh, pleasant conversationalist, and which 
season will also be pleasant to you, that hemanta season has set in. 
"These days the dew is harsh to the bodies of people, earth is overlaid with crops, water is unenjoyable, 
but fire is delightful. 
"On appeasing manes with worships during northern solstice and even on performing solstitial rituals 
in time, the righteous people are becoming free from evils. 
"Amply fulfilled are the desires of the villagers with the affluence of milch cows and dairy, and the 
vanquishing kings are make moves for the purposes of their further vanquishes. 
"While the sun is steadfastly attending the direction of Time-god Yama, namely southern horizon, the 
northern direction is not brilliant like a woman who lost the vermilion mark on her forehead. 
"By their very nature Himalayas are the depositories of snow, and presently distanced from the sun they 
are very obviously snowy true to their name. 
"By the way of touch the mid days are comfortable and in these days the daytime is very much comfortable 
for sauntering, thus the sun in daytimes is genial and ungenial are the shades and waters. 
"Overwhelmed by snow presently the noontimes are with soft sun, with bitter cold, with mists and wintry 
breezes, and with them the forests too are bleak in their sheen. 
"Precluded is the reclining under open sky as the nights are led by the Pushya constellation, they will 
now be with brownish-grey fog and chilly, and prolonged are the lengths of nights whereby the three 
watches of night will be quickly slipping away.
"Transgressed is the destiny of moon by the sun as moon lost the chance of keeping people happy with 
his lustrousness in these days, thus the lustreless moon remained in a blushing sphere with fog, just 
like a mirror blinded by the fog of a suspire. 
"Even on a full moon day the moonlight is unbright blemished by mist, and it is appearing like brightly 
Seetha becoming swarthy by sun's heat, but not brightly. 
"The western breeze by itself will be cool to touch, but presently charged with snow it is wafting doubly 
chilly in the early hours. 
"Covered with the dew the forests that already covered with crop fields of barley and wheat are beaming 
forth, together with the callings of waterfowls, at the rise of the sun. 
"The paddy crops in fields are gleaming forth with golden lustre, and their heads full with grain and 
a little bent down are shapely like the flowers of date-fruit. 
"Though he came up long back, and though his beams are spreading around, besieged by snowy mist the 
sun is appearing as moon. 
Inappreciable is the warmth of sun in the mornings, but comfortable for touch at noontimes, since the 
reddish but a little palish sunshine is radiating on earth. 
"The pasturelands are a little moistened with the fall of dewdrops, but the fields of forest are enlivened 
by the radiance of tender sun's warmth. 
"On easily touching very clear and cold water with its very broad trunk that intensely thirsty wild 
elephant is backing away its trunk for the water is that cold. 
"These waterfowls that are sitting nearby are not entering into waters like cowards not entering battlefields. 

"Subdued by snowy darkness, enclosed in misty gloom, and reft of flowers these forest ranges appear 
like those that are asleep. 
"Now the rivers are imperceptible as their water is overspread with dewdrops, but their water-birds 
are perceptible only by their callings, thus making that river perceptible, and such rivers are now 
glistening with moist sandbanks and shores. 
"Owing to the fall of snow, further owing to the softness and coldness of sun, the water deep down the 
wells is generally agreeable for drinking. 
"Lotus lakes are left alone with stalks of lotuses as their petals are aged and withered, decrepit are 
the fibrils and carpels, thus impaired by cold they are ungracious in look. 
"But during this time, oh, manly-tiger, ushered by anguish that virtue souled one Bharata must be practising 
ascesis in city with adoration to you. 
"On forsaking kingdom and pride of becoming the king of Ayodhya as well, and varied and various pleasures 
too, he is in self-denial, and with his food regulated he sleeps on chilly surface of earth. 
"Even he might always be getting up at this time of the day and proceeding to River Sarayu for a bath 
surrounded by ministers, definite is that. 
"But how can he who is brought up in high comfort, a delicate one too, enter the cold-wet waters of 
River Sarayu, in these small hours. 
"That lotus-petal eyed one with blue-black complexion is an imposing one with lion-like waist, being 
the noblest he is knower of dharma thus an advocate of truth, and thus intolerant of ignominy, and as 
a self-restrained one he talks dearly and sweetly, and he is dextrous and an enemy-destroyer, such as 
he is, that Bharata on forgoing all of his various pleasures he is devoted to you, as you alone are 
his adorable brother. 
"Even though you are in forests far away from him, he is following you in the practise of austerities, 
and such a brother of yours, that great-souled Bharata has refused ascent to heaven. 
"  Humans do not derive father's attitude but they take of their mothers' is the well-know maxim in 
the world, but Bharata rendered it otherwise. 
"Whose husband is Dasharatha and whose son is gentle Bharata, how then can she, our mother Kaikeyi, 
is with this sort of cruel disposition, indeed " Thus Lakshmana spoke to Rama on their way to River 
Godavari. 
When that upright Lakshmana is speaking those words that way out of his fondness towards Rama, Raghava 
spoke to Lakshmana, intolerant of that slanderous talk about their mother. 
"In any way, dear Lakshmana, you are not supposed to deplore another mother of ours, but you go on telling 
the topics of Bharata, the king of Ikshvaku-s. 
"My mind is indeed set to dwell only in forest, and it is firmly avowed, but while yearning for Bharata's 
fellowship my fascination to reunite with him is recurring again. 
"I reminisce his words well, that are genial, sweet, heartily, ambrosial and that will gladden the heart. 

"When can I really reunite, oh, Lakshmana, with great-souled Bharata, valorous Shatrughna, and with 
you and Seetha." Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. 
Thus worrying that way while proceeding, there Rama reached River Godavari and performed bathing with 
his younger brother Lakshmana and along with Seetha. 
Then on offering water oblations to manes and gods that impeccant trinity extolled the rising sun and 
gods likewise. 
On taking bath in the river along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama shone forth like All-controlling god 
Rudra, who will be radiant on taking bath along with his consort Paarvati and with his follower Nandi, 
the Holy Bull. 
The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is 
a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed 
to reflect the Vedic import, as said at --,vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya, and that which is 
pious and meritedpuNyam vedaischa samamatamat --, should have accounts on seasons   is 
the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord 
with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology,veda-anga : jyotiShya. Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda.uShaa 
vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyakaHence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s.
Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, 
for e.g.,hemantaspring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. Andvasantapost autumnal 
season is described in Kishkindha rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and 
after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha.varSarainy season is portrayed in th chapter 
of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do 
explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said:vedopabR^ihmaNaartham 
pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa 
lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam 
kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j~naapanaartham eva kR^itam 
iti dharma paryavasaanam sambhavati eva -- dharmaakuutam
Thus dharma is upheld in 
all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they 
too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs.
This chapter vies with the third chapter of Aranya Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. Here Sugreeva 
is indulged in bodily pleasures with his females and in Aranya Kanda, as accused by Shurpanakha, Ravana is 
hankering after other women. Here Sugreeva is dizzy with drinks and in Aranya, Ravana is dizzy with his supremacy. 
These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal withraaja niiti shastra'political science.' Here the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, 
whereas Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shurpanakha. Out of the total verses that are here in 
this traditional edition, verses from to are unavailable in the critical edition, perhaps estimating them to 
be lateral interpolations, and there this chapter is quickly concluded. These verses belong to the exposition 
of 'kingly vices...' which Tara rationally defends.
Then on invitation inside, Lakshmana, the slayer of braving enemies, entered that delightful cavelike Kishkindha 
at Rama's orders. 
On seeing Lakshmana the huge-bodied and highly mighty monkeys available at the gateway stood back with their palms 
adjoined in supplication. 
But on seeing the fumingly infuriated son of Dasharatha, all the monkeys become scared and they do not 
even gather around him. 
Glorious Lakshmana has seen the splendid Kishkindha which is a colossal cave crafted with jewels, replete with 
flowered orchards and richly rife with gemlike objects d'art. 
Kishkindha is compacted with mansions and multi-storied buildings that are embellished with various precious stones, 
and it is enlivened with blossomed trees that bear fruit of every relish and of every season, Lakshmana has 
seen such a Kishkindha. 
That city is brightened with vanara-s who with their prepossessing appearances are attired in marvellous garlands 
and garments, and who can change their guise just by their wish, as they are the children of gods and Gandharva-s, 
and Lakshmana has seen such a city. 
She is perfumed with fragrances that are pleasing to the sense of smell like sandal-scent, true-aloe-scent, and 
the scents of lotuses and her wide avenues are highly exhilarated with the bouquet of flower liquors and grape wines, 
and Lakshmana has seen such a sweet-scanted city Kishkindha. 
In that city, Lakshmana of the Raghava dynasty has seen buildings that are not single-storied but multi-storied, semblable 
with Mt. Vindhya and Mt. Meru, and he even saw mountain rapids with pure water. 
On the kings-way, Lakshmana has seen the exquisite mansion of Angada, likewise the lavish mansions of distinction 
about the other vanara chiefs, namely Dvivida, Gavaya, Gavaaksha, Gaja, Sharabha, Vidyunmaali, Sampaati, 
Suuryaaksha, Hanuma, and that of the noble-souled Nala, and even those of Virabaahu, Subaahu, Kumuda, Sushena, 
Lt. Taara, Jambavanta, Dadhivaktra, Niila, Supaatala, and that of Sunetra. 
Those mansions that glitter like silver clouds, fragrant with scents and festooned with flower tassels, replete 
with wealth and food grains, are beaming with gemlike female-vanara-s, and Lakshmana saw them on his way. 
The grand palace of the king of monkeys, Sugreeva, which vies with the palace of Indra is inaccessibly immured 
in a white mountain. The spires of that palace are similar to the peaks of Mt. Kailash and it is shining forth 
with fully blossomed trees yielding fruits that can fulfil every relish of everyone. Some more providential and 
heart-pleasing trees available there is the endowment of Indra, which in shine is equal to blackish rainy clouds, 
yielding divine flowers and fruits, and casting cool shades. Excellent garlands are strung around the palace and 
robust monkeys wielding weapons are screening its gateways, while its main archway cast in refined golden is splendorous. 
And the very bold Lakshmana unimpededly entered such a fascinating palace of Sugreeva, as with the sun entering 
a colossal cloud. 
Passing through a set of seven courtyards in which carriers like palanquins, sedans, and even settees are spread 
over, that duty-bound Lakshmana has seen the highly protected and prodigious palace chambers of Sugreeva, which 
is stuffed here and there with numerous golden and silver love-beds and divans on which highly valuable upholstery 
is provided. 
On his very entry, Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes commixed with lyrics and strains of string instruments, 
and all are unvarying in cadence, wording and lettering.
On his very entry, Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes of lyrics with pulsing wording and lettering, conjoined 
with strains from string instruments, like Veena etc., and all have a pulsating cadency. 
And the great-mighty Lakshmana has seen many females in Sugreeva's palace with diverse features and pride of 
their beauty and youth. 
On observing the females of a worthy bloodline in the palace of Sugreeva, who are wearing garlands of worthy 
flowers, engrossed in making worthwhile flower tassels and even adorned with the worthiest jewellery, he also made 
a mark of the chambermaids. None of them is overawed, or overstrained, and everyone is over-embellished in dressiness. 

Thereafter on hearing the chimes of silver anklets and tintinnabulations of golden cinctures of female vanara-s 
that refulgent Saumitri is embarrassed to proceed further. 
On hearing the tinkles of the jewellery of female vanara-s valiant Lakshmana is highly provoked with an instantaneous 
bitterness and he twitched the bowstring as though to fill all the points of the compass with twanging. 
His decent conduct hauling him down dextrous Lakshmana stood aside contingent on isolation and alongside his 
heartfelt anguish of Rama. 
With that twang of the bowstring the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is startled and jerked up from his exquisite 
seat as he ensured that Lakshmana had arrived. 
"As Angada indicated to me earlier, Saumitri, the votary of his brother, has come down on... it is very clear..." 
Thus Sugreeva exclaimed. 
As has been apprised by Angada earlier, and even now by the twang of the bowstring, that vanara Sugreeva made up his 
mind about Lakshmana's arrival, and he has become whey-faced. 
The chief of monkeys Sugreeva then staidly spoke this advantageous word to the exquisite lady Tara while his heart 
is bewildered with dismay. 
"This brother of Raghava is mellow-hearted by his nature, oh, suavely eye-browed Tara, but he turned up as if 
with some disdain, really what must be the reason for a grudge? 
"What do you see as the basis of this young man's spite, oh impeccable Tara, this best one among men will not 
invoke despite, indeed, to a fault. 
"If you consider that we have done something objectionable to him, in the least, let that be quickly determined 
by your nimble-wittedness and let that be made known immediately. 
"Otherwise, oh, lady, you alone are apt to see him in person, and it will be apt of you to appease him with words 
blent with mitigation. 
"Just on seeing you he that highly pure-souled Lakshmana will stop venting his spleen, by the way, great-souls 
will not be rampageous with women, won't it? 
"If you seek his presence with propitiatory words his heart and senses will be pacified, and then I will be able 
to see that lotus-petal-eyed Lakshmana, the destroyer of his enemies." Sugreeva thus spoke to Tara. 
Exquisitely featured Tara went to the proximity of Lakshmana with a waddling gait, tipsily flustering eyes, rrivière-strings 
of golden cincture dangling, and with a sticklike gracile body humbly bent. 
On observing the wife of the king of monkeys, the great-souled son of the king of humans stood aside unemotionally, 
and because of the presence of females, he backed down on his anger with his face cast down. 
She who is unblushing by her inebriety and even by the gracious look of the prince Lakshmana, such a 
Tara spoke a highly noteworthy sentence that is dauntless in friendliness and entirely mitigatory in its vein. 

"Oh, prince, what is the cause of your anger? Who is not abiding by your oral order? And who is he that draweth 
nigh of a wildfire that is befalling on a forest of dried-up trees, without a shadow of doubt?" Tara enquired 
thus with Lakshmana. 
On hearing her words which are with a prelude of propitiation, and which by far evince friendship for all practical 
purposes, Lakshmana trustfully spoke these words. 
"Oh, Tara, the associate of husband's prosperity! Why your husband is bound up in profligacy alone, remiss in 
garnering rectitude and riches, and his dereliction is unbeknownst to you, is it? 
"Without thinking either about the interests of the kingdom or about us that are cringing to anguish, oh, Tara, 
your husband along with his council of ministers is indulged in lechery. 
"On stipulating a four-month criterion for an embargo the king of fly-jumpers is not able to realise the completion 
of that period as he is frantically insensible. 
"To achieve right rectitude and rightful riches this way of bacchanalia is inappreciable, 
isn't it? Just going on drinking will bring prosperity, aspirations and even probity to ruin. 
"If one is not going to requite the favour done in his respect an awful detriment occurs in his rectitude, 
isn't it? Thereby, that reneger will lose a highly noble friend and thereby a great shortcoming occurs to him 
in achieving his purposes. Thus a threefold ill befalls on that reneger. 
"Indeed a friend avowed to truthfulness and virtuousness is greater than one's means and aspirations, but 
you husband forsaking that pair of his means and aspirations that have been fulfilled by such a righteous friend, 
he is not even standing by the probity. 
"Therefore, when our present task is standstill in this way due to the bouts of your husband, oh, the knower of 
the brunt of tasks, what is it we can undertake hereafter...you may aptly give an example..." Thus, Lakshmana 
spoke curtly to Tara. 
On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellow tendency of Lakshmana, Tara realized 
that the purpose of Rama is lapsed, but having confidence in ultimate success she again said to him.
On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellow tendency of Lakshmana, and even 
on realizing the lapse committed by Sugreeva in the purpose of Rama, yet reposing her confidence in Sugreeva's 
capability to achieve results, she again said to Lakshmana.  
"Oh, prince, this not the time for angering, also your people shall not be subjected to anger, and it will 
be apt of you to tolerate Sugreeva's fault because he is desirous of achieving results for you. 
How in name can a meritoriously high-minded being show his anger on a relatively might less inferior being, 
say Sugreeva, whose mightiest brother's mightiness and essence, say that of Vali, are deducted by none other but 
by your brother associated with you, and oh, lad, who goes into the control of fury, say of your kind, while he 
is restrained by his perfection, and a source of abstemiousness. 
"I am aware of the fury of Rama, the friend of the champion of the monkeys, namely Sugreeva, I am also aware of the 
time lapse in the task, I am even aware of the folly we have committed, and what needs to be done in this matter, 
I am well aware. 
"As to how the intensity of bodily pleasure-seeking will be highly intolerable, I am aware even of that, and I 
am equally aware of those female vanara-s with whom Sugreeva is now incessantly bound up with lust. 
"Gauging by your mindset which is presently bridled by fury, you appear to be disinclined towards spells of sensualities, 
thus these aspects are past your comprehension. All right! If a man were to be voluptuary he would be inadvertent 
of place and time, wouldn't it? Then, how about ethicalities, or rights and wrongs? 
"He who shunned decency because of the vehemence of randiness, oh, the eradicator of braving enemies, and he who 
is delighting in lust is consorted with me, ergo condone your brother-like Sugreeva, the protector of Vaanara 
dynasty. 
"Esteemed sages who take delight in their holy merit and pious asceticism, they will be closely following 
the course of their desire fulfilment when entangled in lust, then how about this one, namely Sugreeva, being 
an impulsive monkey, besides being a king, how he cannot wallow in enjoyment. 
She that vanara female Tara whose eyes are fluttery under the influence having said this way, she again picked 
up where she left off and sentimentally spoke this sentence to Lakshmana whose brunt is inestimable, in the interest 
of her husband's well-being. 
"On the part of his endeavour in your task, oh, best one among men, he has ordered long before for its operation 
aiming to achieve your objective, even though he is servile to overindulgence. 
"By all means, marvellously intrepid Vanara-s that are the residents of various mountains and that can change 
guise just by their wish has come in hundreds, in thousands, in millions. 
"Hence oh, dextrous one, get inside the palace chambers for you have been standing here at the door coyly unwilling 
to behold womenfolk inside, and enough is this upholding of tradition by you. Oh, come on, peering at the wives 
of friends with a friendly intent is not at all impolite for good-willers." Thus Tara affectionately invited Lakshmana 
inside the palace chambers. 
Welcomed by Tara and hastened by the haste of his duty, that dextrous enemy-destroyer Lakshmana entered the select chambers. 

Lakshmana has then seen him who is seated like the Sun in firmament on a choicest golden seat which is elaborated 
with the worthiest upholstery, whose body is remarkable besides being spruced up with excellent ornaments, who is 
wearing exquisite garlands and robes, who is glorious with a marvellous appearance and even appeared as an unconquerable 
as with Indra, and who is presently enwreathed with vanara-females who are also bedecked with precious ornamentation 
and garlands, and on seeing him Lakshmana with franticly bloodshot eyes appeared as the Terminator. [--, 
, ]
Sugreeva whose complexion is like that of rich gold is seated on an exquisite seat tightly hugging his wife Ruma, 
and that brave one has seen Lakshmana whose quintessence is never-flinching, thus, that suspiciously wide-eyed 
Sugreeva made sheep eyes at the furiously broad-eyed Lakshmana. 
On hearing the words of Angada along with those of his ministers, namely Hanuma, Plaksha, and Prabhava et al, 
also on knowing that Lakshmana is angered, sensible Sugreeva stirred from the seat. 
On discriminating the pros and cons Sugreeva spoke this sentence to the strategist-ministers, for he is 
an expert in strategies and a diligent one in carrying out those strategies. 
"I have not in the least spoken any ill of them, nor committed any misdeed in their respect, thus I am thinking 
why should Raghava's brother Lakshmana take offence at me? 
"Unsympathetic rivals of mine, who will always be snoopy for scope, might have ear-filled Raghava's brother about 
the fabricated faults of mine. 
"In this situation, all of you on your part and according to your perspectives have to find out firstly and meticulously 
about the attitude of Lakshmana, along with a steady but diligent determination thereof. 
"There is no fear for me from Lakshmana, not even from Raghava, but an unfounded ire of a friend alone 
is giving rise to disquiet. 
"It is always practicable to befriend any, but in turn, it is impracticable to manage that friendship, even a trifle 
splits off that friendliness for sentiments are transient. 
"On that score, I am flustering because of the noble-souled Rama, and I cannot possibly requite the favour that 
has been done to me." So said Sugreeva to his ministers. 
While Sugreeva is saying that way, the eminent-monkey Hanuma spoke with a dint of his expediency, from among 
the Vanara ministers. 
"In any case, it is not astonishing to say, oh, king of monkey troops, that you with deep regard have not forgotten 
the advantageous help rendered to you, since it is natural for you. 
"On his part, Raghava tossed off his fear distantly and eliminated Vali, whose valour equals that of Indra, only 
to fulfil your cherish. 
"Anywise, by his friendliness with you Raghava must be annoyed, hence he must have expedited his brother 
Lakshmana, whose disposition in effect to is enhance prosperity. 
"You have become ecstatic, oh, the best of the best timekeepers, hence you are unaware of the slippage of time, 
but the sedate and dark-green autumn on its part is underway unfolding dark-green leaves canopying seven-leaved 
banana plants. 
"Clear is the sky with its planets and stars as clouds have vanished on it, even all the ten directions are clear, 
and the rivers and lakes too are equable. 
"Because the time for campaigns has chanced, oh, the ablest monkey, and because you were very slumberous you have 
not got the drift of it, as such Lakshmana must have come here, and it is obvious. 
"Raghava's bitter words are endurable by you as he is primarily an anguished person, further he is the one whose 
His wife is abducted, and he is magnanimous in giving the kingdom to you, besides, he is reproachful through 
another person, namely Lakshmana. 
"Indeed, I do not foresee any other appropriate means for you, as a blunder is committed by you, other than seeking 
Lakshmana's pardon duly adjoining your palms. 
"A king is to be advised beneficially and unhesitatingly by the minister designates, that is why I am speaking 
what I hold fast discarding fear. 
"If Raghava is highly infuriated he is capable of keeping the world under his control along with gods, demons, Gandharva-s 
just hitching up his bow, isn't he? 
"It becomes unseemly to infuriate him who is to be placated time and again, especially when remembering his earlier 
beneficence to you and when you are beholden to him. 
"Prostrate yourself before him along with your son, friends and relatives to pay deference, oh, king, and abide 
by your own accord, you made with him remaining under his auspices, like a wife abiding in the care of her husband. 

"It will be unseemly to fend off the ruling of Rama, or his brother Lakshmana even in your imagination, oh, 
king of monkeys, as your heart is aware of the human tenacity of that Rama, whose resplendence vies with that 
of Indra, and who is associated with selfsame Lakshmana, isn't it." Thus Hanuma spoke to Sugreeva. Then that Hanuma, who has good deeds for his credit, on hearing the words of Lakshmana, even knowing that they are finely meaningful, rejoicingly recalled in his mind that Sugreeva's effort was going to fructify.
"Conceivable is the retrieval of the kingdom by that great-souled Sugreeva...and for which deed, this purposive Rama has come, and that deed desired by Rama is also achievable by Sugreeva, and thus all this has come by..." Thus thought Hanuma.
Then Hanuma, the ablest flyer is thus very gladdened...and in turn then spoke to that very learned one, namely Rama.
"What for you have come into these perilous forests hemming in Pampa Lake along with your brother, for these are impenetrable forests abounding with many a serpent and animal?" Thus Hanuma asked Rama.
On hearing the words of Hanuma, Lakshmana motivated by Rama, narrated the the great soul of Rama, the son of Dasharatha.
"The king named Dasharatha, a resplendent one and the patron of virtue was ruling the four-caste system with its, and by his rectitude, for he is also bound within that four-caste system...
None is despising him, nor he despised any and for all the living beings he is like the Grandparent Brahma on earth...
"And he, King Dasharatha who performed rituals agniSToma and the like Vedic rituals wherein he donated liberally, and this one is his eldest son, and he is renowned among people by the name of Rama...
"He is the protector of all beings and the follower of Father's directives, he is the eldest one among the sons of King Dasharatha... possessor of high virtues, qualities and royal fortune befitting to a king... but he is deprived of his kingdom, and came hither to dwell in the forests... nevertheless, followed by me...
"With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, this self-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like the Sun followed by his consort Prabha, who vanishes when the day is abated...
With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, this self-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like the sun with his dwindling resplendence when the day is abated...
"I am the one who obtained servitude by the justness of this faithful and knowledgeable one, and his younger brother, by name I am named Lakshmana...
"He who aspires to keep up the well-being of all the beings, and he who is merited for all comforts and respectability is now devoid of his prosperity and predisposed to forest dwelling... such as he is, his wife is abducted by a guise-changing demon in a lonely place, of whom we know not... we know not which demon stole his wife...
"One named Danu, son of Diti, who acquired demon-hood by curse had said that Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, is a capable one, and he even said, "That great valorous Sugreeva can know about the abductor of your wife..." saying thus that Danu is released from the curse of his demon-hood moved skyward and went away to heavens while becoming self-luminous...
"All this is informed to you, as it is as you have asked.Myself and Rama, we now have our recourse to Sugreeva alone...
"He who gave away riches in charity, who obtained unequalled renown and who himself was the lord of this world earlier, now accepts the lordship of Sugreeva...
"Who was a patron of virtue and who himself was a shelterer, to whom Seetha is the daughter-in-law, such a shelterer's son Rama is now taking shelter under Sugreeva...
"He who is a virtuous one and protector of all the world, and who is the only refuge for all in earlier times... such a Raaghava, my mentor, is now seeking refuge with Sugreeva...
"By whose beneficence all these people are always delighted, he that Rama is now seeking benefaction from the lord of monkeys...
"By which kingDasharatha, are all the kings with all possible good attributes are always, and at all times were esteemed to be safeguarded as defensible kings, such kings eldest son Rama, renowned in all the three worlds for his sheltering the needy, has now taken shelter under monkey lord Sugreeva...
"One who is rebuffed by sadness, and even agonised by it had already sought refuge, hence it is apt of Sugreeva to do a favour in Rama's respect along with other vanara commanders..." Lakshmana said thus to Hanuma.
To Lakshmana, who is telling that piteously with tears falling out, the eminently lettered Hanumaan said this in his return.
"Intellectuals of your kind, who have conquered anger and senses are to be seen by the chief of monkeys Sugreeva, for your advent, is a godsend...
"He who is made as an enemy, very much insulted, and abrogated from kingdom by his own brother Vali, that Sugreeva is roaming about forests fearing him alone, his brother Vali...
"He that son of Sun, Sugreeva, will render help to you two, joining forces of our like Vanara-s in searching Seetha..."
Thus Hanuman on speaking melodious words with politeness, also said to Raghava, "Good, we may now approach Sugreeva...."
Hanuma when said thus virtuous Lakshmana adored him customarily in the way befitting to an envoy, and spoke this to Rama...
"Raghava, as to how this monkey seems to be happy in meeting us, by way of his narration, and he too neared us as an aspirant of some deed to be performed by us, hence joining them seems to fulfil your mission...
"He is talking with a lucid expression and pleasing facial tinge by which he seems to be gladdened at his heart... needless is telling untruths to such a valiant son of Air-god, Hanuma, isn't it!" So said Lakshmana to Rama.
Then he that very intelligent son of Air-god Hanuma, took those two valorous Raghava-s to go to the king of monkeys Sugreeva.
On discarding the ascetic's semblance that estimable monkey Hanuma obtained his own monkey's form, and mounting those two valiant ones onto his back he proceeded towards Sugreeva.
Hanuma, the extensively renowned heroic son of Air-god with a pious mind and highly audacious nature is then gladdened like the one whose difficult deed is just accomplished, thus he gladly travelled to that mountain where Sugreeva is abiding, along with Rama and Lakshmana.Thereafter, Kausalya afflicted with grief of her son and seeing the king lying down depressed with sorrow, spoke to the monarch as follows:
"Having planted her poison on Rama the tiger among men, indeed Kaikeyi of crooked
ways will surely wander about freely like a female serpent that has cast off its slough"
"Having fulfilled her desire of expelling Rama to the forest, Kaikeyi the charming woman will frighten by clamping down upon me, like a dangerous serpent in the house."
"Even giving my son to her as a slave would have been better. By that Rama would
have at least stayed in the house by doing the work entrusted by her and roaming about in the city, asking alms.
"Having willfully thrown Rama out of his position, Kaikeyi has acted in the same way as one who tends the sacred fire throws a part of the sacrifice to ogres on a new or full moon."
Together with his wife, accompanied by Lakshmana and walking like king of elephants having a bow in hand, the mighty armed hero surely will have entered the forest "
" In the forest, what fate will befall them who had never seen such a suffering
before and who have been sent by you to a forest life as per the wishes of Kaikeyi?"
"Devoid of riches, those youthful beings, in exile at the age when they should be
enjoying diversions of every kind, how are they to live in misery, having only roots and fruits for their nourishment?"
"When that auspicious hour will come to me that will bring an end to my sorrows and I shall see Rama with his wife and brother returning here?"
"When will Ayodhya regain her pristine glory, with people thrilling with rapture and be adorned with rows of towering banners the moment it hears of the two heroic princes (Rama and Lakshmana) being present ? "
"When will the city rejoice like an ocean swelling jubilantly on a full moon night to perceive the two princes who are tigers among men come back from the forest? "
"When will the mighty armed hero (Rama) enter the city of Ayodhya placing Sita in
his front in the chariot as a bull would follow a cow?"
"When will thousands of men shower the parched grains of paddy on the royal highway over my two sons (Rama and Lakshmana) the subduer of their enemies, entering the city?"
"When shall I see the two princes adorned with splendid ear-rings and armed with
excellent bows and swords, entering Ayodhya like a pair of mountains crowned with peaks?"
"When will those two princes with Sita merrily go round the city clockwise, giving away flowers and fruits to virgins and brahmanas?"
"When will the pious Rama, grown ripe in intellect and shining like a god in point of age ,return to me, cherishing the world like the proportious and timely rain?"
"Undoubtedly in some past life, through mean-mindedness, Oh, valiant king, I believe that the teats of cows were cut off by me while their calves were longing to suck them."
"Oh, tiger among heroes! Fond of my child like a cow, I, as such was forcibly
deprived of my child by Kaikeyi in the same way as a cow having a calf of tender age may be deprived of her calf by a lion."
"I cannot indeed wish to survive without my only son who is adorned with all virtues and is well-versed in all scriptures."
"There is not the least capacity imaginable in me to sustain my life here so long as I fail to perceive my beloved son (Rama) who is mighty armed and Lakshmana of great strength"
"This fire born of grief occasioned by separation from my son, is torturing me in
the same way as the illustrious sun, possessed of greatest splendor, scorches this earth with its rays in summer."Hearing those words, which were appropriate for that place and time, spoken by that high-souled 
Vibhishana, his brother, Ravana spoke the following words in reply:
"You have spoken well indeed that killing of an envoy is forbidden. Another punishment 
other than killing needs is certainly meted out to him."
"It is said that a tail is possibly a beloved ornament for the monkeys. Let his tail 
be burned immediately. Let him go with a burnt tail."
"Let all his relatives together with his friends, kinsmen, and amicable persons then see 
him miserably injured with his deformed limbs."
Ravana ordered that the monkey be carried around with his burning tail by the demons 
in the entire city around its crossroads."
Hearing those words of Ravana, the demons, hard-tempered with their wrath, wrapped, up 
old ragged clothes around Hanuma's tail.
While his tail was being wrapped around with cotton tatters, Hanuma proliferated, soon 
after catching dry wood in forests.
The demons sprinkled oil and set out fire on that tail. Then, Hanuma, with his face resembling 
the rising sun with his mind filled with anger and impatience and with his burning tail threw those demons 
down.
To see the burning tail of that Hanuma, the delighted demons together with their women, 
children and elders went there.
Tied down again by the cruel demons, coming together, the heroic Hanuma the foremost 
among monkeys made up his mind appropriate for that occasion (as follows):
"Though I have been tied down, those demons cannot do whatever they wish to do against 
me. Breaking the ties, I can fly up and kill them."
"If these evil-minded demons fasten me who is acting for the good of Rama my lord, because 
of the command by their lord, no rebuff has been done to me."
"I am adequate to kill all these demons in battle. But, for the delight of Rama, 
such a city of Lanka is fit to be espionage again. For this reason, I am putting up with it."
"Lanka was not indeed observed well as to the particulars of specifications of the fort 
when it was seen by me during the night. Surely, it is to be seen by me during the daytime."
"Let the demons tie me down again and torment me as they wish, by burning my tail. 
There will be no travail to my mind."
Then, those delighted demons went, seizing Hanuma, who concealed all types of his feelings, 
who was strong and foremost among monkeys.
Sounding couches and kettle drums and proclaiming the acts of Hanuma like his damaging 
the pleasure garden, the demons performing terrible deeds dragged Hanuma throughout that city.
Accompanied by demons, Hanuma the annihilator of enemies, went happily and roamed about 
in that great city of demons.
Then, Hanuma saw some wonderful houses some wrapped-up plots of land, and well-parted cross 
ways.
Hanuma, the son of the wind god, saw streets congested with dwellings, places where several 
roads meet, high-ways as also approach roads, small inner apartments, and palaces appearing in multitudes, 
like clouds.
All the demons proclaimed in crossroads, four-pillared temples, and royal high-ways, 
saying that Hanuma was a spy.
Women, children, and old people came out from their respective dwellings, with an eagerness 
to see that Hanuma with his burning tail.
While the tip of Hanuma's tail was being ignited by the demons there, those female demons 
with monstrous eyes then informed that unpleasant matter to Seetha, the princess.
"O Seetha! That monkey with a red face, who had a conversation with you, is being moved 
around in the city, with his ignited tail."
Hearing that cruel news, created as much sorrow as when she was carried away by 
Ravana, Seetha was tormented with grief and started to pay homage to the fire god.
Then, the large-eyed Seetha, wishing for the welfare of Hanuma, prayed the fire god with 
her devoted self.
"If I have done any service to my husband, if I have performed a penance, and if I am 
a faithful wife, please be cool to Hanuma."
"If the wise Rama has even a little of kindness to me and if I have still some good fortune 
remaining to my credit, please be cool to Hanuma."
"If that virtuous Rama recognizes me as one, who is endowed with a good moral conduct 
and who is ardently desirous of meeting him, please be cool to Hanuma."
"If the venerable Sugreeva, true to his promise, can make me traverse from this ocean 
of sorrow, please be cool to Hanuma."
Then, the fire god, as though informing the fawn-eyed Seetha about the well-being of 
Hanuma shone brightly with sharp flames, undisturbed and shooting out pointed flames towards the right.
Even wind-god, the father of Hanuma, combined with the fire on Hanuma's tail, swept coolly 
like a snow breeze, creating a solace for Seetha.
While his tail was in flames, Hanuma was reflecting on why the fire, which was blazing on 
all sides were not burning him.
"It is conspicuous with large flames. But it is not creating any pain for me, as if a 
snow-ball is kept at the tip of my tail."
"Or, while I was jumping over the ocean, a surprise alliance was formed with Mount Manaka 
and through the mountain, with the ocean, because of Rama's power. By this, the reason for the coolness 
is clear."
"If such an eagerness was there in the mind of the sea and the wise Mount Mainaka for 
the cause of Rama; will not the fire-god show the same degree of eagerness in making its touch cold?"
"The fire does not burn me, due to the kindness of Seetha, the powerfulness of Rama, and the friendliness 
of my father."
That Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, reflected again for a moment, jumped with 
swiftness and roared too.
Then, the glorious Hanuma like a mountain peak, approached the city gate, which was looking 
high and stood secluded from the crowds of demons.
That prudent Hanuma assumed the form of a mountain and immediately within a moment, assumed 
an exceedingly short form, thus becoming free from his tethers.
The glorious Hanuma, having been free from his bonds, again assumed the form equal to 
a mountain and while looking around, found an iron rod belonging to the arched doorway.
That long-armed Hanuma, again taking that rod made of iron, killed all those guards.
That Hanuma, having impetuous valor in combat, destroying those demons and looking 
over Lanka, shone as the sun encircled with rays, with the wreath of flames blazing on his tail.The godly saint Valmiki composed Ramayana on Rama's retrieving kingdom, wording admirably 
and meaningfully. 
Sage Valmiki said Ramayana in twenty four thousand verses, in five hundred chapters, in six 
books, likewise an end-piece too. 
Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint 
thought over thus 'really, who will render all this ballad...' 
Then Lava and Kusha who are in the attire of hermits have touched the feet of that contemplative 
soul Valmiki, who is now thoughtful. 
Glorious Kusha and Lava are the virtue knowing princes, and they are endowed with melodious 
voice, besides being the residents of the same hermitage, thus Valmiki saw them saluting at 
his feet. 
On seeing that pair intellectuals who are proficient in Veda-s that self-reliant sage Valmiki 
made those two to memorize the epic, as the epic Ramayana is composed only to reinforce the 
import of Veda-s, as an ancillary. 
That sage with observed sacred vows has rendered the entire epic in the name of 'Ramayana', 
'Sublime Legend of Seetha' and 'elimination of Ravana'. 
To read or to sing it is melodious, adaptable to music with three scales and sevenfold tune, 
and orchestral to the tunes of string-instrument and rhythm included... 
Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung 
 
They are conversant with the art of music and proficient with the pitch and pausing their 
voices, and those two brothers have not only a wealthy voice, but they also look like celestial 
singers. 
They have charm in their appearance and melodiousness in their voice, they are like the two 
reflections of one original object, and thus they came out from the body of Rama, separately. 

They the princes have memorized that virtue-expounding epic, the best; in its entirety and 
in doing so, they rendered that epic faultlessly. 
They sung the epic as schooled, well aware of its content and intent, among the assemblages 
of sages, scholars and also of eminent persons, with their best concentration 
Once those two great-souls who endowed with musical talent and with all remarkable features, 
sung this epic, standing nearby the midst of a gathering of sages and pious souls. 
On hearing that, the eyes of all the sages were overspread with tears of happiness, and they 
appreciated saying, 'splendid, splendid is this...' 
All those saints being the saint-patrons of virtue are pleased at heart, and praised the praiseworthy 
Kusha and Lava, while they are singing. 
"The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... though this has 
happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... 
"On getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, that too melodiously 
and rapturously, marinating the pitch and tune..." So said the saints. 
While the great saints of blessed ascesis are appreciating that way, those two melodiously 
sang very effectually and very meaningfully. 
And someone, a pleased saint, got up and bestowed a handy vessel to them... another reputed 
sage, lauding them contributed a jute robe. 
And another sage bestowed a black-deerskin, and like that yet another a sacred thread... someone 
gave a water-pot and another great saint a girdle of maunja grass to singers, while that way 
another contributed an under cloth; another sage gladly contributed a hatchet to them, another 
a saffron clothe, and yet another saint bestowed a cloth-wrapper; another delivered tuft-headband 
also, and another enchanted for their singing ballad handed out a sacrificial vessel, and 
another a bundle of firewood sticks, and yet another gave a plank-seat of audambari wood, 
and other called forth blessings, and someone then happily chanted bless-hymns for longevity... 
there by all the truth-avowing saints, those that are great sages have thus bestowed boons. 

"Surprising is this well-said rendering of Valmiki... it is the subsistence for tomorrow's 
poets... and this is completed sequentially, as well... 
While this song that generates longevity and prosperity, and one that is melodious one to 
all ears is being sung everywhere in streets and king's ways and while those two singers who 
are experts in singing any kind of music are being appreciated everywhere, Rama has seen them. 

Then on seeing them Rama, the enemy-eliminator, fetched those honour-worthy bothers, Lava 
and Kusha, to his palace and honoured them. 
He that king Rama is then surrounded by his ministers and brothers that are sitting his nearby, 
he himself sat on a divine golden throne. 
Having seen the mannerly brothers endowed with beautiful features, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, 
and Shatrughna, and Bharata likewise. 
Rama said to thus, "Let this ballad be keenly heard from these divinely resplendent brothers, 
for it contains versatile words and meanings...' and thus he motivated the singers. 
Even those two singers have sung the ballad melodiously and effectually, with their clear 
and clarified voices, like the melody of string and rhythmic instruments, with very clear 
and meaningful intonation. 
Enthralling courtier's bodies, minds and hearts also, and thus that song shone forth as it 
is for all ears, bearing a comfort in its manifestation, among the gathering of the people. 

"These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who also possess kingly features, but they are great 
hermits... this narration is endowing good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious 
legend "  
Then those two singers, motivated by Rama's words, sang the ballad in maarga system, for they 
are well versed in it, then even Rama, who is also in the congregation, again to pacify his 
mind,  became interested at heart  On hearing that sentence of scholarly Kushanaabha those hundred 
			girls touched his feet with their foreheads and spoke to him. 
" 'The all-pervasive Air-god desired to dishonour us, oh, king, resorting 
			to improper approach and overlooking virtuous conduct. 
" 'Our father is there and we are not independent, you be safe, hence 
			oh, Air-god, you may request our father to know whether he gives us 
			to you or not.' Thus we have told the Air-god, but... 
" 'Though we all have spoken to him thus, that Air-god who is bound 
			by venality refused to take notice of our words and he has harmed us 
			a lot.' Thus those girls informed their father. 
On listening their words that highly virtuous and highly resplendent 
			king spoke to the hundred girls with unsurpassed virtue. 
" 'Forgiving is the duty of imperturbable and you have done it. Excellent. 
			Oh, daughters, coursing through your unity my family's prestige is also 
			kept up. 
" 'Forgiveness is an adornment to women, as a matter of fact, even for 
			men, and this matter called 'forgiving' that which is there, it is an 
			impracticable affair. That too, in respect of divinities. And the kind 
			of forgiveness you all possess uniformly, that is further laudable. 
			
" 'Grace is altruism, grace is ritualism, oh, my daughters, grace is 
			glory, grace is virtue, and this universe is verily abiding in graciousness 
			alone for grace itself is the truth, isn't it!' Thus king Kushanaabha 
			said to his daughters and sent them away. 
"On leaving those girls, oh, Rama, that king whose valour matches that 
			of gods and who is an expert in thinking strategies started to think 
			with his ministers on the topics like, as to how his daughters are to 
			be espoused to, to which country they are to be sent, at which time 
			marriage shall happen, and to which matching bridegroom the marriage 
			is to be proposed, and so on." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. 
			
During that time a great-resplendent sage named Cuulii is there, who 
			is propitious in his demeanour and who holds his semen upward, and who 
			has achieved high ascetic practise strictly according to Vedic canons. 
			
"While that sage is in the practise of asceticism a celestial female served 
him at the place of his ascesis, safety be with you oh, Rama, she is Somada by her 
name, the daughter of Urmila. 
"Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering 
			to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Cuulii 
			has become satisfied with her service. 
"When her service is fructified, oh, Rama, that sage benevolently spoke 
			to her saying, 'I am perfectly pleased with your service, let good betide 
			you, what cherish of yours I have to fulfil.' 
"Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada 
			who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke 
			with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. 
" 'Vedic splendour is flourishing in you when you have become one with 
			Brahma, oh, supreme ascetic, I may please be endowed with a righteous 
			son whose ascetic spirituality may embody the spirituality enunciated 
			in Veda-s. 
" 'I am unmarried and nobody's wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter 
			under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your 
			faculty of asceticism.' So said Somada to sage Cuulii. 
"That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and 
			Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild. 
			
"King Brahmadatta endued with superb grandeur ruled from a city called 
			Kaampilya as with Indra ruling the heaven. 
"The most righteous king Kushanaabha then made up his mind, oh, Rama 
			of Kakutstha, to espouse his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta. 
"Inviting Brahmadatta that great-resplendent lord of the land, namely 
			the king Kushanaabha, married his hundred daughters to him, pleasing 
			highly in his heart of hearts. 
"As with the tradition of marriage king Brahmadatta who vies with lord 
			of gods, namely Indra, in succession took the palm of each of the hundred 
			girls into his palm. 
"By mere touch of hand of Brahmadatta alone, their misshape and desperation 
			are evanished, and all of those hundred maidens beamed bright as they 
			are retouched with utmost elegance. 
"On seeing his daughters getting release from the effect of Air-god 
			Kushanaabha became highly joyful, and he took great delight time and 
			again as and when he looked at them. 
"Later when the marriage is complete king Kushanaabha bade farewell 
			to king Brahmadatta along with his wives, his own hundred daughters, 
			and along with the groups of religious teachers. 
"Somada, the celestial female and the mother of Brahmadatta, is gladdened 
			to see her son Brahmadatta, for the worthwhile deed done by him in removing 
			the blemish caused by the Air-god to the girls, or in bringing those 
			worthwhile girls as her daughter-in-laws. She is further gladdened while 
			her feet are traditionally and repeatedly touched by a hundred daughter-in-laws 
			in succession, coupled with her own raising of each of the daughter-in-law 
			to embrace for a hundred times. Thus Somada has gone on caressing each 
			of her hundred daughter-in-laws, and in doing so she is gladdened to 
			do so over and over again, she is gladdened. She thus praised Kushanaabha 
			for giving his gemlike daughters as her daughter-in-laws and blessed 
			the daughter-in-laws. Describing that legend of Kaartikeya to Rama, the descendent of Kaushi, 
			namely sage Vishvamitra has further spoken this best sentence worded 
			melodiously to Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha. 
"Once there was a valiant and virtue-souled king of Ayodhya named Sagara, 
			who is without offspring, as such he was longing for offspring. 
"The daughter of King of Vidarbha, renowned by name Keshini, is the 
			eldest wife of Sagara, and she was virtue-minded, and an advocate of 
			truth. 
"The daughter of Arishtanemi, namely sage Kashyapa, and who is also 
			the sister of Garuda, the Divine-Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, is the second 
			wife of Sagara, who is known by the name Sumati. 
"Reaching the Himalayan Mountains along with his two wives that 
			great King Sagara practised asceticism on a mountain called Brugu-prsravana 
			for progeny. 
"On completion of a hundred years of ascesis, and when the Sage Bhrugu 
			is worshipped with asceticism, that sage who is a prominent one among 
			the patrons of truth bestowed a boon to Sagara. 
" 'Oh, merited one, you will achieve very admirable progeny, and 
			oh, best one among men, you will also acquire an unparalleled renown 
			in the world. 
" 'One of your wives will mother a son who enriches your dynasty, oh, 
			dear sire, and the other mothers sixty thousand sons.' Said Sage Bhrigu 
			to Sagara. 
Highly gladdened are the daughters of kings of Vidarbha and Aristanemi, 
			i.e., the queens of Sagara, and on making palm-fold in supplication 
			at the sage who is speaking that way, and on gaining the grace of that 
			sage they spoke to him. 
" 'Which of us will carry one son, oh, Brahma-sage, and which of us 
			begets numerous sons, we two wish to listen about that, oh, Brahman, 
			let your word betide truth.' Thus, the queens of Sagara spoke to the 
			sage. 
On listening their words the Sage Bhrigu spoke in a glorious tone, 'let 
			your freewill be brought to bear this issue'. 
'Whether one wants one son who enriches dynasty, or whether numerous 
			sons who will be highly energetic, highly renowned, and highly enthusiastic. 
			Who wants which boon from either of them?' Thus, the Sage gave them 
			the option. 
"On listening the words of the sage, oh, Rama, oh, delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty, the first queen Keshini has chosen one son who enriches the 
			dynasty in the presence of King Sagara. ]
"Sumati, the sister of mighty-winged Garuda and the second queen of 
			Sagara has then chosen sixty thousand sons with great enthusiasm and 
			high reputation. 
"On performing circumambulations to the Sage Bhrigu along with wives, 
			oh, Raghu's scion, also on reverencing him head-bent, the king Sagara 
			proceeded to his own city. 
When the time rolled by then the elder wife Keshini gave birth to the 
			son of Sagara who is reputed by the name Asamanja. 
But the second queen Sumati on part, oh, tigerly-man Rama, verily 
			delivered a round and long egg which is like a single gourd, and on 
			breaking it up sixty thousand sons are issued forth from that cucumber 
			like egg. 
The childminders brought up those siblings in vessels filled with ghee, 
			the clarified butter, and after a protracted time all of the children 
			have attained youthfulness. 
After a long time the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara have become 
			youthful, and handsome in their aspects. 
But, oh, best one among men, oh, Rama, the elder son of the king Sagara, 
			namely Asamanja, always used to grab and hurl children into the waters 
			of River Sarayu, and on seeing the drowning children he used to enjoy 
			with laughter. 
This way, when that son Asamanja is with sinister activity, a torturer 
			of goodmen, and delighter in the undesirable activities towards citizens, 
			his father king Sagara expatriated him from the city. 
But Asamanja's son is a valorous one, who by name is Anshuman, and who 
			is an acceptable one for all people and who fondly converses with all. 
			
"Oh, best one among men, Rama, then after along time a decided thought 
			has occurred to king Sagara that, 'I shall perform a Vedic-ritual.'
That king Sagara who is an expert in Vedic-procedures has then taken 
			a decision along with the assemblages of his religious-teachers insofar 
			as the procedures of the ritual are concerned, and he commenced to perform 
			the Vedic-ritual. "On overseeing the crestfallen monkey-soldiery, which is with many hundreds and
thousands of soldiers, then Jambavanta said this way to Hanuma. 
"Oh, valiant one in the world of vanara-s, being an erudite scholar among all the
scriptural scholars, Hanuma, why do not you mumble something, why do you resort to a calmly
loneliness... 
"By your brilliance and brawn, oh, Hanuma, you match up to the king of monkeys Sugreeva,
or even to Rama and Lakshmana, as well... 
"The son of Kashyapa Prajapati and Lady Vinata is the best bird among all the birds
who is superbly mighty and who is universally renowned as Garuda... 
"Indeed, I have oftentimes seen that highly glorious, rapidly speedy, great mighty
bird Garuda, pecking up reptiles from the ocean... 
"Whatever is the strength of his wings, that much is the strength of your arms, and
even by the yardsticks of his dash and dare, yours too, are unreprovable... 
"Oh, forthright monkey, you are the finest among all beings by the dint of your
force, faculty, flair, and fortitude... why then is your unreadiness in this task of leaping
Ocean... 
"Punjikasthala yclept Anjana is the nicest apsara among all apsara-s and she is the
wife of Kesari, the monkey... 
"She who is distinguished for her unparalleled mien in the three worlds, oh, dear
boy Hanuma, had to take a rebirth on earth as a monkey who can change her form by her wish, owing
to a curse... 
"She who took birth as the daughter of great-souled monkey chief Kunjara, on
assuming a human physique, putting on caparisons of amazing garlands, dressed in silken clothing,
and shining forth with the rarity of her beauty and nubility, at one time ambled on the top of a
mountain like a streak of lightning athwart a black cloud of the rainy season. 
"When she is strolling on the mountaintop Air-god has slowly lifted that
broad-eyed lady's auspicious and ochry silk apparel with red rouches... 
"Then the Air god beheld her well-twinned, thickset, roundish thighs, and even the
paired off plumpish breasts, and her beautiful face which is well proportioned in its build...

"Just on catching the sight of that gorgeous one, whose pelvic girdle is fat and
ample and who is slender-waisted, and who by all her limbs is pristine, the Air-god is enamored...

"He that Air-god who is ensorcelled by Love-god in all of his limbs, though he is
limbless and existing in thin air, embraced that immaculate lady with both of his far-flung arms,
as he lost his heart for her... 
"But she that conscientious lady perplexedly said this sentence in that matter of
invisible hugging, 'who wishes to despoil my vow of one-man-one-wife...' 
"On listening to the words of Anjana the Air-god spoke this in reply, 'Oh, high-hipped
one, I won't dishonor you, hence let there be no fear in your heart, for I am the all-permeating
Air-god... 
" 'By which reason I embraced you and impregnate myself within you, by that reason
you are impregnated in a supersensory manner, thereby you will beget a valiant son endowed with
intellect... 
" 'An admirably brave, and a bravely dazzling, and a dazzlingly forceful, and a
forcefully overpowering son will be there, also thus, he will be a coequal of mine in flying off
and jumping up...' Thus, the Air-god said to Anjana. 
"Oh, arcane monkey Hanuma, when Air-god said so to her, oh, ambidextrous one, your
mother is gratified, and then, oh, bullish fly-jumpers, your mother very well divined you in a
cave... 
"Thereafter, when you were a boy you have seen the just risen sun in the vast of
forest, and deeming it to be a just ripen reddish fruit, and thinking it to be a best catch, you
hopped up and flew towards the sun in the sky... 
"Even on your flying up three hundred yojana-s, oh, brave monkey, and even when
sun's radiation puffed and blew you down, you did not get into any anguish as were
indefatigable... 
"Oh, mighty monkey, even on seeing you who are coming near the vault of heaven,
Indra is captivated by anger and by his effulgence he catapulted his Thunderbolt at you...

"Then, your left cheekbone, zygomatic arch, is broken when you fell on a
highest mountaintop, from thereupon your name-phrase is indeed averred asHanumaan... 
"Then on observing that you are mutilated, highly infuriated is that scent-wafter
Air-god and that tempestuous Air-god have not physically circulated throughout the triad of
worlds... 
"When the triad of worlds is being roiled with breathlessness, all the
administrative gods of the universe are bewildered, and they start to supplicate the Air-god for his
grace... 
"Oh, chivalric warrior at war, while the Air-god is being supplicated, oh, dear boy,
Brahma gave you a boon decreeing your 'indestructibility by any missile...' 
"On scrutinizing that you are unhurt even after being hit by Thunderbolt, oh, ablest
Hanuma, the Thousand-eyed Indra kind-heartedly gave you a choicest boon saying that your death
occurs only by your own volition... 
"Such as you are, you are Kesari's son through his wife, oh, frightful pugilist, and
you are the lineal son of Air-god, and even by your gusting you are selfsame to Air-god, and even
by your flying also you are his selfsame to Air-god, in all respects... 
"Presently we are as good as dead, and among us presently you are the only one rife
with competence and valiance, you are the other Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, to us...

"During the period of Trivikrama incarnation, I have circumambulated the earth
inclusive of its mountains, forests, and thickets twenty-one times, moving rightward around
it... 
"Like that, by the order of gods, we have collected those herbal plants
with which ambrosia had to be churned from the Milky Ocean, and in that way, then there used to be a
great energy for us... 
"Such as I am, I am now aged and my valiance is completely lessened... but at the
present time, you alone are endowed with all endowments among us... 
"Thereby oh, vanquisher Hanuma, you give a jump-start to leap the ocean. Indeed, you
alone are the best ones among all fly-jumpers, and this entire vanara army is anxious to witness
your prowess... 
"Arise, oh, lion-like monkey, leap over this vast ocean, oh, Hanuma, your escape
velocity is indeed unlike that of all the other beings... 
"Oh, Hanuma, all these monkeys are dispirited. Why this indolence of yours? You
boldly triumph over the ocean as your speed is highest, supersonic, super-photic, super-cerebric is
your celerity. As with Vishnu who trod the triad of worlds in a trice, you too triumph over..."
Thus Jambavanta persuaded Hanuma to get ready for action. 
Thereafter, when the best monkey among monkeys, namely Jambavanta, the king of bears
has motivated, then that son of Air-god, Hanuma, whose speed is familiar coupled with his
irresistible enterprise, enormously increased his physique as though to gladded the army of
monkeys. 
"While god Shiva is undertaking ascesis thus, then the gods desiring an Army Chief 
			for celestial forces have arrived in the audience of Forefather Brahma, along 
			with Indra and keeping Fire-god at their fore." Sage Vishvamitra continued his 
			narration to Rama. 
"On approaching the Forefather Brahma, oh, Rama, all of the celestials headed 
			by Fire-god and along with Indra have venerated and then spoke this to him. 
" 'Oh, god Brahma, he who has hypothetically given a Chief of Celestial Army in 
			the form of his potence that god Shiva is undertaking a supreme ascesis, indeed 
			along with Goddess Uma. 
" 'Looking forward for the welfare of the worlds, oh, knower of the procedures, 
			Brahma, you may order us clearly what is to be done next, as you alone are our 
			ultimate recourse. 
"On listening the words of gods, Brahma, the Forefather of all the worlds, soothingly 
			spoke this to the celestials with sweet words. 
" 'What the Daughter of Mountain, namely Goddess Uma, has said that 'you shall 
			have no posterity in your own wives' is true and it cannot be decried, and it 
			is unambiguous too. 
" 'In whom the Fire-god can procreate an enemy-destroying Chief of Celestial Armies, 
			such an empyreal Ganga is there. 
" 'The elder daughter King of Mountains, namely Ganga, will graciously welcome 
			the offspring from Fire-god, and that act of Ganga in welcoming the offspring 
			through Fire-god will also be pleasurable in many ways to the younger daughter 
			of King of Mountains, namely Uma, no doubt about it.' So said Brahma to all the 
			gods. 
"On hearing those words of Brahma, oh, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, all 
			the gods have praisefully worshipped him, as their ends are achieved at the bidding 
			fair of Brahma. 
"On going to that supreme Mt. Kailash, oh, Rama, which is heaped up with many 
			ores, all of those gods have assigned the Fire-god to father a son. 
" 'Oh, Fire-god, you please coordinate the mission of gods, oh, great-resplendent 
			god of Fire, you may release the potence of Shiva, which you have contained so 
			far, in the daughter of King of Mountains, namely River Ganga.' Thus, all gods 
			have requested the Fire-god. 
"On assuring the gods that he will do his best, the Fire-god approached Ganga 
			entreating, 'Oh, Goddess Ganga, you verily bear pregnancy with the potence of 
			Shiva, since this is the select process of all the gods.' So said Fire-god to 
			River Ganga. 
"On listening that sentence of Fire-god, River Ganga adopted a celestial form 
			readying herself, and on seeing her glorious mien the Fire-god seeped throughout 
			her. 
"The Fire-god then drenched River Ganga from all over with the potence of Shiva 
			which he contained so far, oh, Raghu's delight Rama, and every rill and channel 
			of Ganga is replete with it. 
"River Ganga then spoke this to the Fire-god who is in the lead of all gods, 'oh, 
			god, I am incapable to bear up the rampant fervour of yours, and while being burnt 
			with the fire of god Shiva compounded with that of yours my life-force is very 
			highly tortured.' 
"He who consumes fire-oblations on behalf of all the gods, that Fire-god seeing 
			the miserable condition of River Ganga then spoke this to her, ''you may lay away 
			that embryo here at the side of Himalayan Mountains.' So said Fire-god to River 
			Ganga. 
"Oh, great-resplendent Rama, on hearing the words of Fire-god, oh, charming prince 
			Rama, River Ganga indeed ejected that great-radiant embryo of Shiva from all her 
			rills and channels. 
"Which refulgent embryo with the glitter of molten gold has emerged from River 
			Ganga is there that has reached earth, and from that the silver, and even the 
			gold with its matchless dazzle have emerged. 
"In that process, copper and iron are also generated from that combustion of fires 
			of Shiva and Fire-god, and the residua have become tin and lead, and thus that 
			embryo on reaching the earth has evolved itself into various other elements also. 
			
"But, just when that embryo is laid down on Himalayan mountains, entire reed-garden 
			sprouted on that mountain is made brilliant by that glittering embryo and the 
			reed-garden itself has become golden. 
"Oh, tigerly-man, from then onwards the gold with its brilliance equalling that 
			of the Fire-god is renowned by the name ofjaataruupa, one that retains its birth-time form, and oh, Raghava, everything on the mountain, 
			say grass, trees, climbers, and shrubs, all have become golden. 
"Then for the boy who took birth from the embryo deposited in Himalayas, the Wind-gods 
			along with Indra have arranged Krittika stars to simultaneously suckle him. 
"Those Krittika stars have decided among themselves that 'this boy shall be the 
			son for all of us,' and on making such a best resolve they suckled the just born 
			boy. 
"All the gods have then said, 'this boy will be renowned in all the three world 
			as Kaarthikeya, as Krittika-stars have suckled him, with any doubt.' 
"On hearing that blessing of gods Krittika stars gave a wash to that excellently 
auspicious boy who is radiant like fire, and who slid down from the secretion of 
the womb of Ganga. 
"And gods called that boy, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, whose glow is like that of flaring 
			fire and who is ambidextrous as 'Skanda' for he slid down from the secretions 
			of a womb. 
"Then an unexcelled milk instantly came forth from the breasts of the six Krittika-stars, 
			and becoming a six-faced one that boy too sucked that milk from the six Krittika-stars 
			at the same time. 
"On sipping the milk just for one day he became an adolescent boy on that day 
			itself, and even though he is of delicate constitution as a boy, that taskmaster 
			triumphed over the army troops of demons by his own vigour. 
"All of the celestial have then come together under the leadership of Fire-god 
			and they anointed that highly resplendent boy, Skanda, or Kaarthikeya, as the 
			Chief of Celestial Army troops. 
"This way, I have vividly narrated the legend of Ganga to you, oh, Rama, like 
			that the Divine and Meritorious legend of the emergence of Kumara, namely Skanda 
			is also narrated. 
"He who is a devotee of Kartikeyaa, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, he thrives with longevity, 
			also with sons, grandsons on this humanly earth in his mortal life, and on its 
			conclusion he becomes one with Skanda on journeying to Skanda's abode. On sojourning the remaining night on the bank of river Sona along with 
			great-sages, Viswamitra spoke when that night is elapsing into a sunny 
			daybreak. 
"Oh, Rama, night fared into a sunny morning, eastern day-spring is set 
			in, hence awake and arise, you be safe, ready yourself for further travel." 
			
On hearing the words of Sage Vishvamitra, Rama woke up and on completion 
			of morning time religious activities he readied himself for further 
			journey and indeed spoke this sentence to the sage. 
"This River Sona is with auspicious waters and even adorned with dunes, 
			where it is so deep. Oh, Brahman, in which of the two ways, namely 
			by fordless waters or by fordable water with dunes, we have to cross 
			this river?" 
When Rama spoke to him thus sage Vishvamitra replied, "I propose the 
			same route by which these great sages are going. 
Thus spoken by that astute Sage Vishvamitra, the other great sages travelled 
			on, indeed beholding diverse forests and their environs. 
On going a distance on their way, and after a lapse of half a day, then 
			they perceived the prominent one among rivers and the one adored by 
			sages, namely River Ganga. 
On seeing River Ganga with her pious waters and adored by swans and 
			saarasa waterfowls, all the sages felt delighted together with both 
			of the Raghava-s, namely Rama and Lakshmana. 
Then they sojourned on the riverbank of Ganga, and next on taking bath 
			in Ganga they have customarily offered that river's water as oblations 
			to their manes. After that, on enkindling the ritual-fire they have 
			also offered fire-oblations into it for gods. Later, dining on their 
			part of those ambrosian oblations with which they have oblated the fire, 
			those sages perched on the propitious banks of Ganga, surrounding the 
			great-souled Vishvamitra from all sides, to the contentment of their 
			heart in having performed religious chores on the riverbank of Ganga. 
			
When sages are sitting at ease then even Rama and Lakshmana sat down 
			according to their admissibility and custom of sitting before their 
			teachers, and then Rama highly gladdened at heart has spoken to Vishvamitra. 
			
"Oh, godly sage, I wish to listen about Ganga, the river that has a 
			trinal course, and as to how she is reaching the husband of rivulets 
			and rivers, namely the ocean, on pervading all the three worlds." Thus 
			Rama asked Vishvamitra. 
Motivated by Rama's words the eminent-sage Vishvamitra commenced to 
			narrate about the emergence and that way even about the progression 
			of River Ganga. 
"The lordly mountain Himavan who is the greatest treasure trove of minerals, 
			Rama, also treasures up a pair of daughters who by their comeliness 
			are unequalled on earth. 
"The slender-waisted and fascinating daughter of Mt. Meru, oh, Rama, 
			renowned by her name Mena, is the dear wife of Himavan and the mother 
			of those two daughters, indeed. 
"This Ganga has emerged as an elder daughter to Himavan through Mena, 
			oh, Raghava, and that way a girl renowned by the name Uma has become 
			a second daughter to him. 
"Later, all of the divinities intending to fulfil a divine purpose have 
			sought the lordly mountain Himavan to spare Ganga, who is scheduled 
			to become a tri-way-cruising river. 
"With a righteous thinking and hopeful of the welfare in triadic world, 
			Himavan then spared his daughter Ganga whose flow is at her own volition. 
			
"Those divinities who are the well-wishers of the well-being of tri-world 
			welcomed Ganga, who is incidentally intended for the purpose of the 
			tri-world, and they came back to heaven fetching Ganga with them, with 
			a heartfelt joy for their purpose is fulfilled. 
"The other daughter of Himavanta, oh, Raghu's descendent, that unmarried 
			girl namely Uma, she performed a rigorous sacrament taking hold of a 
			supreme devoutness as her ascesis itself is her wealth. 
"As for Uma who is unified with her rigorous sacrament and who is adored 
			by all the world, that best one among mountains Himavanta gave such 
			a daughter to the unique god Rudra. 
"Oh, Raghava, the prominent one among rivers namely Ganga and Uma Devi 
			as well, these are the two daughters of the king of mountains that are 
			highly revered by the world. 
"Dear boy Rama with beautiful gait, as to how the triply coursing Ganga 
			has cruised to heaven in the first phase, I have related all about that 
			cruise to you. 
"As such, that marvellous and sinless daughter of the lordly mountain 
			Himavanta, ever-flowing in the form of water, ascended to the abode 
			of divinities and becamedevaganga, Divine 
			River. Sumantra, the charioteer and one of the misters of King Dasharatha, having heard all about 
the king's desire to perform a Vedic ritual, said this in confidence to king, "oh, king, I 
will tell an early legend, an early legendary narration that I listened... 
"Oh, king, I have earlier heard of this present advice given to you by Vedic scholars, as 
godly Sage Sanatkumara has once narrated an account about the arrival of your sons in the 
presence of other sages, and sage Sanat Kumara said... 
"He said that "Sage Kashyapa has a son known as Vibhaandaka, and his son will be the renowned 
Sage Rishyasringa, and that Sage Rishyasringa will grow up in forests, and will always be 
dwelling in forest... 
"Not knowing others, that Brahman the best, namely Rishyasringa, will always be abiding his 
father and he will follow celibacy of two kinds Brahmanical vows namelyvratitva,praajaapatya...
Not knowing others that Brahman the best, will always be abiding his father, lest his renowned 
celibacy always praised by the Brahmans, will be hindered. 
"In the world he becomes famous for his celibacy, oh king, and he will always be praised by 
Brahmans, and thus time will pass on with that kind of his conduct. 
Sage Rishyasringa looses no time with his servitor-ship to the Sacrificial Fire and also to 
his celebrated father, and during this period alone there will be a famed and very strong 
king Romapaada, a valiant in Anga country... 
"But by a violation of righteousness of that king there will be a shocking and devastating 
famine in that country...
"While the famine is besetting that king Roamapada will be afflicted with grim, and on summoning 
Brahmans and learned scholars he will address them... 
"All of you are well versed in rituals and knowers of the world history... order me how to 
how the purification from sin will be... 
"Thus said by king those scholarly Brahmans and Vedic scholars will say to the king, 'oh, 
king, son of Sage Vibhaandaka, namely Rishyasringa, is to be fetched by all methods... 
"Oh! King, having brought Sage Rishyasringa and honouring him well with good care, procedurally 
give him your daughter Shanta in marriage to that Vedic Brahman and the son of Sage Vibhaandaka... 

"On listening them the king becomes thoughtful about the idea by which it is possible to bring 
that self-controlled sage to his place... 
"Then that intellectual king decides along with ministers, to dispatch clergymen and ministers, 
honouring them well, and then sends them... 
"They on hearing king's words are awestruck and lowering their faces they will say, 'we can 
not go there as we are afraid of sage Vibhandaka, father of Rishyasringa...' 
"After thinking over they will say as a second thought, and having found a solution with a 
plan to bring that sage, 'we will fetch that Brahman and also by that no stigma will occur...' 

"Thus by the king of Anga kingdom and by his courtesans the son of sage Rishyasringa will 
be brought and the presiding deity for rains will shower rains, and Shanta will also be given 
in marriage to that sage...' 
"Sage Rishyasringa, son-in-law of Romapaada, King of Anga ad as well as to you, if invited 
to our kingdom he will bless you to beget sons, oh! King... so said Sage Sanatkumaara to other 
sages and all this is retold by me."  
Then King Dasharatha is delighted and in turn spoke to Sumantra "By what idea Rishyasringa 
is brought to Anga kingdom, that shall be said elaborately..." Then on performing morning time rites in the aurora of next morning, king Janaka 
invited great souled Vishvamitra, along with Raghava-s. 
On reverencing Vishvamitra and the noble souled Raghava-s according to the formalities 
envisaged by scriptures, then the virtue souled Janaka spoke these words, indeed. 

Oh, god, you are welcome, oh, holy sage, bid me as to what I should for you, for 
I am biddable by you, indeed... 
When said thus by the foreseer Janaka,  that 
sage Vishvamitra, for he is presager and wordsmith,  said these words in reply to that valiant king Janaka. 
These two are the sons of Dasharatha, well-renowned Kshatriya-s in world, and they 
are desirous to see that marvellous bow which has a place with you... 
You may show that bow, well bodes you, and on beholding that bow the desire of 
these two princes will come true, and they will go back as they like... 
But Janaka replied the great sage Vishvamitra when he was addressed thus, "I shall 
 tell by which reason that bow has its place here... 
Oh, godly sage, there was a king renowned as Devaraata, sixth one from Nimi,  and this bow was handed down to him for custodial care 
by the Sublime Soul, Shiva... 
Once, during the devastation of the Vedic-ritual of Daksha Prajapati, the mettlesome 
god Rudra, rancorously outstretching the bowstring of this bow, said this to all 
gods, superciliously... 
'Oh, gods, whereby you have not apportioned my portion  desirer of such portion,  I will shred the highly 
revered heads of yours with this bow...'  
Then, oh, best saint Vishvamitra, all gods are truly dismayed, and on their supplicating, 
Bhava, namely Shiva, the God of Gods is gladdened... 
And that Sublime Soul Shiva gladly gave that bow to all of the great souled gods, 
and oh, godly saint, then those great souled gods gave this gem of a bow of Shiva, 
the God of Gods, to our ancestor  for custodial care... 
Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough  gained while consecrating the ritual-field, 
she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned... 
Hers is a non-uterine birth as she surfaced from the surface of the earth, but 
fostered as my own soul-born girl and I determined  boldness is the only bounty,  

Oh, eminent sage, as my daughter has surfaced from the surface of earth and has 
come of age, the kings,  have come and besought for her... 
To all of those kings who are beseeching for the girl, I have not given my daughter, 
saying that she will be given for a bounty of boldness... 
Then all the kings convoked and on arriving at Mithila, then they wanted to ascertain 
the calibre  
For them, those who wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, that bow of Shiva 
is fetched to their proximity, but they are incapable to joggle it, or even to catch 
hold of it... 
Oh, great saint, on knowing the valour of those valorous ones as valueless, I countermanded 
them... oh, ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, by that you may know  
Then, oh, eminent sage, those kings beleaguered Mithila in a blind fury, since 
a self-mistrust bechanced among them all, about their own valour... 
They surmised for themselves that they are brushed off by me, and they possessed 
by a high rancour, they strangled the City of Mithila... 
Then elapsed is an year and in anyway the possessions for livelihood went into 
a decline, oh, eminent sage, thereby I am highly anguished 
Then I have assuaged the assemblages of gods by my ascesis and gods are also highly 
gladdened and gave me fourfold forces... 
Then those evildoers and self-mistrustful kings while being drubbed  vigourless and broken, and they beat a hasty retreat... 

Oh, tigerly sage this is that supremely radiant bow, and oh, saint of sacred vows, 
I will show it, even to Rama and Lakshmana... 
"If Rama strings the bowstring of that bow, oh, sage, I will offer my daughter, 
whose birth is non-uterine, to Dasharatha's Rama..."  
"Oh, Rama, the best one among men and the legatee of Raghu, on taking Shunashepa 
that highly renowned king Ambariisha took rest at noontime on the lakeside of Holy 
Lake." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shunashepa, as a part of Vishvamitra's 
legend. 
While the king Ambariisha is taking rest that highly brilliant Shunashepa came 
to the lakeside of main Holy Lake with high anxiety, and there he indeed saw his 
maternal uncle Sage Vishvamitra who is performing ascesis along with other sages. 

Shunashepa became pitiable and sulky faced by strain and thirst, oh, Rama, and 
he immediately fell in the lap of saint Vishvamitra saying this sentence. 
I have no mother or a father to save me. Then wherefore cousins or relatives 
will be there to protect me. Oh, peaceable saint the eminent, it will be apt of 
you to protect me according to saintliness. 
Oh, illustrious sage, you alone are the saviour to each and every one, isn't 
it! You alone are the guardian angel, isn't it! Hence, let the purpose of the king 
Ambariisha be achieved, and let longevity come to me, and I on becoming imperishable 
and indeed on performing an unexcelled ascesis, I wish to enjoy in heavenly worlds. 

' You shall be my providence with a providential sentiment as I stand unprotected, 
and oh, virtue souled one, it will be apt of you to protect me from misfortune, 
like a father protecting his own son.' Thus Shunashepa appealed to Vishvamitra. 

On hearing that sentence of Shunashepa and on pacifying him in many ways, Vishvamitra 
of higher ascesis, indeed said this to his sons. 
For what reason parents engender sons, desiring positivity and for the purpose 
of welfare in the other worlds, this is the time that has come for fulfilling that 
reason. 
This youngster is the son of sage and he aspires shelter from me. Hence, oh, 
sons, give him satisfaction just by giving life to him. 
You all have done very good pious deeds and you all abide by probity. Hence, 
you bestow appeasement to Fire-god on your becoming the ritual-animals of king Ambariisha 
in lieu of this boy Shunashepa. 
'As a result, Shunashepa will have protectors, Vedic-ritual will be unimpeded, 
gods will be oblated, and my word too will be actualised.' Thus Vishvamitra said 
to his sons. 
But on hearing the saying of the sage, oh, Rama, the best of men, Madhushyanda 
and the other sons of Vishvamitra said this, haughtily and disparagingly. 
'On sacrificing your own sons how can you save another's son, oh, lordly father, 
we deem this as a wrongdoing and as good as dog's meat in a dinner.' Thus the sons 
of Vishvamitra replied their father. 
On listening that saying of his sons that eminent sage Vishvamitra started to curse 
them while fury reddened his eyes. 
You all have not only transgressed my word, but pertly replied me in an impudent 
manner which is abhorrent and hair-raising, and recriminatory according to probity. 

'You all will be whirling around the earth totally for a thousand years taking 
birth in the race that subsists on dog's meat, like the sons of Vashishta.' Thus 
Vishvamitra cursed his sons. 
On making his sons bounden by curse, then that best saint spoke to the pitiable 
Shunashepa, on making unharmed invulnerability to him with sanctifying hymns. 
When you are fastened with sacred fastener to the sacrificial post of Vishnu, 
smeared with red paste and garlanded with red garlands, you praisefully address 
the Fire-god with the words I going to impart to you in Vedic hymns. 
'These two divine hymns, oh, son of saint, shall be chanted in the Vedic-ritual 
of Ambariisha, then you will obtain your aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra taught two 
Vedic hymns to the boy. 
Shunashepa having taken those two hymns from Vishvamitra very attentively has instantly 
gone to that lion-king Ambariisha and indeed spoke to him. 
'Oh, the lion-king, let us go promptly to your ritual place, oh, best king, you 
may apply yourself to your pledge in completing the ritual, with me as its sacrificial 
animal,' thus the boy said. 
On listening that sentence of the son of sage, the king Ambariisha is gladdened 
and proceeded to the ritual hall immediately and spiritedly. 
The king with the permission of officiators of ritual got the boy prepared as a 
ritual animal with sanctified bodily features and clad him in red clothes and got 
him securely fastened to the sacrificial post. 
When Shunashepa is tied to ritual post he immensely pleased two gods, namely Indra 
and Upendra as well, with those two hymns he got from Vishvamitra. 
Then the Thousand-eyed Indra who is satisfied with esoteric laudation is gladdened, 
and oh, Raghava, then he bestowed longevity to Shunashepa. 
Oh, Rama, the best one among men, he that king Ambariisha also obtained the fruits 
of that Vedic-ritual in manyfold, resulted from the grace of Thousand-eyed Indra. 

"Oh, Rama, the best among men, even the virtue-souled great ascetic Vishvamitra 
again performed ascesis at the same Holy lakeside for another thousand years." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued the narration of Vishvamitra's legend. The two enemy subjugators, Rama and Lakshmana, who are sensible of their conduct 
according to time and place, and who will be sensibly talking according to time 
and place, those princes then spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. 
"Oh, god, we are interested to listen at which time those night-walkers come to 
disturb the ritual, and at which time we have to safeguard the ritual from them, 
that you tell us, let not that moment pass away." 
All the sages available there are delighted with the princes of Kakutstha dynasty 
who are speaking thus and making haste for a combat with demons and they praised 
them. 
"Oh, Raghava-s, you have to safeguard this ritual for six nights and days from today, 
and this Sage Vishvamitra who is under the vow of ritual goes into muteness as required 
by the vow." Thus said the other sages near at ritual place. 
On hearing that sentence of the other sages those two glorious princes have wakefully 
safeguarded that woodland of the ritual for six nights and days. 
On alertly patrolling nearby the Altar of Fire those two enemy-destroyers who are 
the wielders of great bows and valiant ones have protected the best sage Vishvamitra. 

While that period of six days is elapsing and when the sixth day has come, then 
Rama said to Saumitri, "you be prepared and be on alert." 
While Rama is saying thus himself quickening to combat then the fire in the Altar 
of Fire flared up suddenly and highly, brightening the chief officiator of the ritual, 
namely Vishvamitra, and other priests around it. 
The Altar of Fire around which sacred grass, drink-vessels, oblation spoons, firewood-sticks, 
and heaps of flowers are kept, and around which Vishvamitra and the conductors of 
ritual are sitting, that altar flared high. 
While the Vedic ritual is proceeding well towards its conclusion according to hymnal 
rendering and rules of conducting the ritual, a strident and frightening blare is 
generated in the sky. 
As to how massive clouds appear in torrential cloudburst, likewise two demons appeared 
enshrouding the sky, and performing wizardry they are about to swoop down towards 
the Altar of Fire. 
Maareecha and Subaahu are the monstrous demons that have come along with their followers 
and they have started to pour down spates of blood. 
On noticing the Altar of Fire swamped with streams of blood, then Rama swiftly ran 
towards that direction and saw the demons in the sky. 
Perceiving that the two demons are about to swoop down on Altar of Fire in haste, 
that lotus-eyed Rama however gave a quick checking look at Lakshmana saying this 
sentence. 
"Lakshmana, I am reluctant to eliminate this kind of these ill-behaved and raw flesh 
eating demons, but no doubt, they will be puffed out with Manava missile like a 
gust puffing thick clouds, you may see." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. 
Saying so that agile Rama fitted the very benign and highly radiant arrow Maanava 
on his bow, and taking aim with it at Maareecha that highly furious Raghava darted 
it on the chest of Maareecha. 
Cleanly hit with that great missile Maanava, demon Maareecha is pitched for a hundred 
yojana lengths in full, and flung down into an ocean rocking with tidewaters. 
On seeing him highly whirling, rendered insensate and thrown out when rammed away 
with the strength of that Cold arrow Rama said this to Lakshmana. 
"Lakshmana, see the Cold arrow belonging to Maanava missile expounded by Manu which 
is taking him away on baffling, but without taking away his life. 
"But I wish to kill these demons for they are ruthless, iniquitous, flagitious, 
ritual-hinderers and blood-drinkers." So said Rama to Lakshmana. 
Thus saying to Lakshmana, as though to show his swift dexterity Rama, the descendent 
of Raghu dynasty, took up a very powerful missile called Aagneya astra, Fire-missile, 
and darted it on the chest of Subaahu, by which that demon Subaahu is struck and 
fell flat on ground. 
In order to bring felicity to the sages that great glorious and supremely generous 
Raghava took up the missile of Air-god and hit down the remaining demons. 
When Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, has eliminated all of the demons that 
are the hinderers of Vedic rituals, the sages available there in that hermitage 
idealised him as Indra was idealised once, when he became victories on demons. 
On the completion of ritual beholding the precincts that are devoid of calamities 
the great sage Vishvamitra said this to Rama. 
"My purpose in conducting the ritual is fully realised, oh, dextrous Rama, and you 
too, as a highly illustrious prince, have actualised the word of honour of your 
mentor, where one mentor is your father King Dasharatha and the other is myself, and 
likewise oh, valiant Rama the glory of this Accomplished hermitage is also actualised..." 
thus when Vishvamitra is applauding Rama, they have come close to vesper-time for 
vespertine prayers on Sandhya, the goddess of gloaming. When that sage Vishvamitra has finished narration of the legend of the 
			daughters of Himavanta, both the brave ones, namely Raghava and Lakshmana 
			in their turn have extolled that legend and spoke to that eminent-sage. 
			
"This admirable discourse given by you about Ganga is exhaustive in 
			righteousness, oh, Brahman, and it will be apt of you to tell emphatically 
			about the divine and earthly legend of the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			namely Ganga, for you are aware to expatiate upon it. 
"By which reason that world purifier Ganga influxes into three paths? 
			Oh, virtue-knower, and connected with which deeds of merit this triple-courser 
			Ganga is renowned as the best one among all the rivers in three worlds?" 
			Thus Rama and Lakshmana have asked the sage Vishvamitra. 
When Kakutstha-s have enquired that way, the ascetically-wealthy sage 
			Vishvamitra has narrated all the legend of Ganga in its entirety, staying 
			among the sages. 
"On his getting married to Uma, oh, Rama, the sublime-ascetic and bluish 
			throated god Shiva, as his throat became blue when he consumed poison 
			during the churning of Milky Ocean, at one time with a predilection 
			towards her he has started lovemaking with her. 
"While that sublime, sagacious and blue-throated God Shiva is in lovemaking, 
			oh, enemy-scorcher Rama, a hundred divine years have elapsed, even then 
			he had no son in her, namely Goddess Uma. 
"All the gods headed by Brahma have then started to ponder, 'is there 
			anybody who can inevitably sustain that being which emerges from this 
			goddess Uma after this prolonged yogic act of copulation with Shiva?' 
			This being the worry of all gods they have prepared for action. 
"All of the gods on approaching and paying their deference to Shiva 
			spoke this to him, 'oh, God of Gods, oh, one who is interested in the 
			welfare of these worlds, oh, Great-God, considering the supplication 
			of all gods it will be apt of you to bestow grace.' 
" 'Worlds cannot capably bear your offspring born out of your effulgence, 
			oh, Supreme-God, hence you may practice yogic asceticism along with 
			your consort Goddess Uma in unison with Vedic postulates of Yoga, rather 
			than progeniture, and desiring the welfare of the three worlds you may 
			please retain your refulgent seed within your own radiance, thus protect 
			this universe, since it will not be apt of you to render it devoid of 
			worlds with the efflux of the unmanageable potence of yours .' So said 
			gods to Shiva. 
"On listening the words of gods that Rarefied-God of Universe, namely 
			Shiva said, 'so be it,' and further spoke this to all of the gods, indeed. 
			
" 'I wish to bear my sperm in my virility and Uma in hers, let the immortals 
			and mortals as well, derive a perfect bliss. 
" 'But that part which has already stirred up from its place is irrestrainable, 
			as such, oh gods of eminence, you tell me who can contain that part 
			of the unexcelled potence.' So said Shiva to gods. 
"Thus spoken by Shiva, then the gods in reply spoke to him whose banner 
			is Divine-Bull, namely Shiva, 'that part of the potence which has already 
			stirred up, the earth indeed endures that now. 
"Thus said by the gods that Yogi of par excellence and the God of Gods, 
			Shiva, discharged his refulgent semen with which the earth together 
			with its mountains and forests is overspread. 
"Thereby the gods in their turn said even to Fire-god, 'you enter the 
			great-potence of Rudra along with Wind-god, lest that potence may annihilate 
			the earth and earthlings, because you can consume anything that comes 
			in touch with you. 
"And when Fire-god invaded that great-potence of Shiva it has emerged 
			as White-mountain, also thus it has become as a divine forest of reeds 
			equalling the Sun and Fire in its resplendence, wherefrom the highly 
			brilliant Kumara has emerged. 
"Later on, the gods together with the assemblages of sages are well 
			pleased at heart as it has happened according to their prayer, thereby 
			they fulsomely adored Shiva and even Uma. 
"Oh, Rama, but the daughter of Himalayan Mountain, namely Uma, while 
			irefully saying this to the divinities she cursed them all with her 
			eyes reddened in anger. 
" 'Wherefore, I who am desirous of a son had been prevented from the 
			intimacy with my husband, therefore you shall be infecund to beget progeny 
			through your own wives. 
" 'And from now onwards you wives shall remain infertile...' and on 
			saying this way to all of the gods she also gave a curse to the earth. 
			
" 'Oh, Earth, your appearance shall be bizarre and you will be a wife 
			to many. And oh, verily base-minded earth, rendered sully by my anger 
			you shall have no gratification caused by the children as you are bigoted 
			against my son. 
"That God of Gods Shiva becoming ill at ease to look at all of the distressed 
			gods, equally feeling small to convince his consort Uma, he has started 
			to journey towards the western quarter which is ruled by Rain-god. 
"On going to the northern side of Himalayan Mountains, that God of Gods, 
			Shiva settled down in ascesis along with his consort Uma on the peak 
			of a mountain emerged from Himalayas. 
"This is the legend of mountain's daughter, namely Goddess Uma vividly 
			narrated to you, oh, Rama, and now listen from me along with Lakshmana 
			about the emergence of Ganga. When that matchlessly illustrious Rama has asked for details, that highly 
			resplendent sage Vishvamitra started to narrate about that forest to 
			Rama. 
"Here, oh, dextrous Rama, he who is worshipped by gods and who has got 
			outstanding ascesis that Vishnu resided here in the pursuit of practising 
			ascesis and yoga for good many years, likewise for a hundred eras. 
"This is the erstwhile hermitage of great-souled Vaamana renowned as 
			Accomplished hermitage, why because the sage with supreme ascesis Kaashyapa 
			got accomplishment to such of his ascesis there only. 
"In the meantime, when Vishnu was in his asceticism in this hermitage, 
			the son of King Virochana, namely Bali, has completely conquered all 
			the assemblages of gods together with Indra and his coterie called Wind-gods, 
			and ruling that kingdom where that hermitage is there, he has become 
			renowned in all the three worlds for his magnanimity. 
"That great mighty chief of demons Bali then conducted a very grand 
			Vedic ritual. But when Bali is conducting that ritual remaining as its 
			officiator all the gods personally approached Vishnu, keeping Fire-god 
			ahead of them, just here in this hermitage and they spoke to him. 
" 'Oh, all-pervading god Vishnu, Bali the son of Virochana is conducting 
			an unsurpassed Vedic ritual, before the completion of which our own 
			mission, say the task of gods, is to be achieved completely. 
" 'Whoever the supplicant might be and from wherever he might be coming, 
			but if one approaches and supplicates to him he is donating that in 
			as is where is condition, whatever is supplicated and wherever it might 
			be. 
" 'As such, oh, Vishnu, you may effectuate the most suitable merited 
			deed for the welfare of gods on resorting to your illusory power, Vishnu 
			Maya, and on assuming the form of a dwarf to deal with Emperor Bali.' 
			Thus gods appealed to Vishnu. 
"In the meanwhile, oh Rama, he whose brilliance is similar to ritual 
			fire, who will be with his wife Lady Aditi, who is resplendent with 
			his own vitality, that godly sage Kaashyapa on completing his asceticism 
			along with Lady Aditi started to eulogise the boon giver and the eliminator 
			of demon Madhu, namely Vishnu." Thus Vishvamitra is narrating to Rama. 
			
" 'Oh, Supreme Person, you are abounding with asceticism, aggregate 
			of asceticism, the aspect of asceticism, and the very soul of asceticism, 
			such as you are, I am able to see you with the well practised asceticism 
			of mine. 
" 'In your physique I am seeing this entire universe, oh, god, and you 
			are without a beginning and indefinable, and in you I am taking shelter.' 
			Sage Kaashyapa praised Vishnu in this way. 
Vishnu is gladdened for the devotion of sage Kaashyapa who is absolved 
			of any blemish in his ascesis, and then Vishnu said this to, "You may 
			seek a boon as you are boon-worthy, I opine that you are a preferred 
			one to me, let safety be with you." Thus Vishnu said to Kaashyapa. 
On hearing the word of Vishnu sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mariicha 
			said, "oh, god the accorder of boons, as you are pleased with us it 
			will be apt of you to bestow the boon besought by Lady Aditi and the 
			gods, oh, lord with lofty vows, for which boon I am also supplicating 
			to you, following them. 
" 'Oh, god, oh, sinless one, you may please attain the sonship of Lady 
			Aditi and myself, oh, dispenser of demons, it will be apt of you to 
			render help to gods who are agonised in the anguish owing to the predominance 
			of Emperor Bali, by becoming the younger brother of Indra. 
" 'Oh, god of gods, as the works of my austerities are accomplished 
            here, by your grace this hermitage will be renowned by the name Siddhaashram, 
            Hermitage of Accomplishment, hence oh god, arise from here to 
			become my son.' So said sage Kaashyapa to Vishnu. 
"That great resplendent Vishnu then adopting a semblance of a dwarf 
			emerged from Aditi, and that dwarfish ascetic boy approached Emperor 
			Bali, the son of Virochana." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. 
"That dwarf ascetic boy Vaamana begged and received a space that can 
			be covered in three strides, but strode all the three worlds in those 
			three steps for the purpose of saving worlds, as he is interested in 
			the welfare of all the worlds. Vishnu gave the earth back to Indra restraining 
			Emperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great resplendent Vishnu made 
			the three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. 
"This hermitage which at one time is presided by Vishnu, is an eradicator 
			of stress, either the stress and strain caused by the evil on earth, 
			or the stress of going through the cycle of birth and death, thus this 
			hermitage is an accorded of salvation, and I am also beneficed with 
			this hermitage owing to my devotion to Vaamana. 
"Demons causing obstacles, oh, tigerly man Rama, will be arriving at 
			that hermitage and there alone those demons with evil pursuit are to 
			be eliminated. 
"Rama, we now go to the unexcelled hermitage of Accomplishment, oh, 
			dear one, as to how this hermitage belongs to me, this also belongs 
			to you." Thus Vishvamitra said to Rama. 
So saying that great sage Vishvamitra is highly gladdened to lead Rama 
			together with Lakshmana to the hermitage, and on his entering the hermitage 
			with those two, that sage shone forth like moon with a two starred constellation 
			called Punarvasu, the fifth or seventh lunar mansion, after dispersal 
			of mist. 
On seeing the arrival of Vishvamitra all of the resident sages of Accomplished 
			Hermitage have quickly approached him with hustle and bustle adoring 
			him. 
Those sages reverenced Vishvamitra according to their deservedness, 
			likewise they have offered hospitality to both of the princes, Rama 
			and Lakshmana. 
Those two princes from Raghu's dynasty and the enemy-subjugators, namely 
			Rama and Lakshmana, briefly took rest and adjoining palms they spoke 
			to the sagely tiger Vishvamitra. 
"Oh, the eminent sage, today itself you may undertake the ritual of 
			solemnity that is undertaken prior to the main ritual, be safe, and 
			let this Hermitage of Accomplishment become an accomplished one in eradiating 
			vice true to its name, and let the word of yours given to my father 
			in fetching me to this place come true." So said Rama to Vishvamitra, 
			supported by Lakshmana. 
When he is said so, that great radiant and supreme sage Vishvamitra, 
			thereupon scrupulously undertook the vow of ritual controlling his senses. 
			
Both the youngsters Rama and Lakshmana on spending that night vigilantly 
			got up with the sunrise. On finishing morning time bathing they meditated 
			upon the easterly aurora, and then on completing the supreme meditation 
			on Gayatri in its regularity, they addressed themselves to sage Vishvamitra, 
			who by now has enkindled ritual fire and sitting before the Altar of 
			Fire. "That great-saint Vishvamitra then leaving off the snowbound Himalayas on north, 
oh, Rama, he reached eastern quarter and undertook rigorous ascesis." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. 
Committing himself to a vow of muteness, oh, Rama, he performed an unexcelled and 
unmatched ascesis which is highly impracticable for others to perform. 
Even on completing a thousand years, even when that great-saint became woodenly, 
even many barriers are at full blast, oh, Rama, fury has not entered his heart of 
hearts, for he stood fast in an unmitigated ascesis on making a firm determination. 

On one day when those thousand years of ascesis with the rigorous pledge of Vishvamitra 
are being completed, and when he started to eat his meal, oh, Rama, best of Raghu's 
dynasty, Indra arrived there disguising himself as a Brahman and requested for the 
readily available meal. 
Then that godly Vishvamitra willingly gave away all the readied meal to that Brahman, 
and as no meal is leftover by Brahman-Indra, that great-ascetic Vishvamitra starved 
himself. Vishvamitra did not speak a little to the Brahman in dissent as he is abided 
by his pledge of muteness, and he again remained in muteness and breath-control. 
Like that, he indeed carried on his ascesis. 
That eminent saint remained without respiration for another thousand years, and 
then fumes have started to emit from the head of sage who is controlling his breath, 
by which fumes the triad of worlds looked as if it is searing, and this startled 
all the worlds. 
Then the gods, sages, gandharva-s, serpents, reptiles, demons are puzzled at the 
ascesis of Vishvamitra, and as their own resplendence is dulled by the ascesis of 
Vishvamitra, thereby they are marred by this blemish of lowered resplendence, then 
all of them addressed the Grandparent, Brahma. 
Even if that great-saint Vishvamitra is angered and allured in order to foil 
his ascetical ascendancy, by all of us and by all means oh, god, he is transcending 
these lures, angers, and passions by his ascesis. 
Now, even an imperceptible imperfection does not really appear in him, but if 
his heartfelt desire is not meted out, he will devastate the triad of worlds with 
his ascetic power. 
All the directions are all tumultuous, all the oceans are tempestuous, and all 
the mountains are eruptive, and nothing is bright. 
The earth is highly tremulous, air is gusting turbulently, oh, Brahma, people 
tend to become non-theistic and we do not know what to do. 
All the beings in the triad of the worlds are very highly perturbed at their 
senses and they are as though stupefied, and when juxtaposed the sun is lustreless 
before the resplendence of that great sage. 
Oh, God, great saint Vishvamitra turned out to be the embodiment of Fire-god, 
and before that great-resplendent and most reverential sage makes up his mind for 
total destruction of all worlds he is to be placated. 
'As to how the End-Time Fire entirely blazed away the triad of worlds previously, 
now this sage may do likewise, hence whatever is his predilection that may be given 
to him, even if he wants to become the potentate on the realm of gods.' Thus, all 
gods appealed to Brahma 
Then all the assemblages of gods keeping the Grandparent Brahma in their forefront 
appeared before that great souled Vishvamitra and said this harmonious word. 
Oh, Brahma-sage, you are welcome. We are much contented with your ascesis. Oh, 
Kaushika, you have achieved Bahaman-hood by your rigorous ascesis. 
'Along with the assemblages of Marut-Wind-gods, I bestow upon you a long life. 
Let blissfulness betide you. You be safe. Oh, gentle sage, you may take leave as 
you please.' Thus, Brahma said to Vishvamitra. 
On hearing the word of Grandparent Brahma and the other residents of heaven, and 
on paying good devoirs to all of them that great saint cheerfully said. 
If Brahman-hood and eternality have befallen on me, let the quintessence of AUM 
and vaSat syllables, and even all Veda-s patronise me. 
'Oh, gods, he who is the outstanding one among the geniuses of kingcraft, and 
among the scholars of Veda-s as well, even that Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma, 
shall acknowledge me in this way as Brahma-sage. Oh, the best gods, you may take 
leave if you can effectuate this ultimate yearning of mine.' Thus Vishvamitra requested 
the gods. 
Then the best one among meditators Vashishta has come over there when the gods 
besought him to come, and he made friendship with Vishvamitra. He also said in this 
way to Vishvamitra, 'you are a Brahma-sage.' 
'No doubt, you are a Brahma-sage and everything will accrue to you in accordance 
with the sublimity of this sageship,' and when Vashishta said so to Vishvamitra, 
all the gods have gone away as they have come. 
On getting his Brahman-hood even the virtue-souled Vishvamitra started to reverence 
the supreme among meditators and his counterpart Brahma-sage, namely Vashishta. 

When his aim is effectuated Vishvamitra ambled all over the earth abiding in ascesis, 
and oh, Rama, this great souled sage Vishvamitra achieved Brahman-hood in this way. 

"Oh, Rama, he is the best saint, he is the embodiment of ascesis, he is always obliged 
with righteousness, and he is the stronghold for fortitude." 
On narrating the legend of Vishvamitra in this way that best Brahman and great-resplendent 
Sage Shataananda took respite. And on listening the narration of Sage Shataananda 
said in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, king Janaka said this sentence to Kushika's 
son, Vishvamitra, with suppliantly adjoined palms. 
Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, you happened to be here at this Vedic-ritual which 
is conducted by me, oh, Kaushika, that too, along with Rama and Lakshmana, the legatees 
of Kakutstha, thereby I am fortunate, I am much obliged. 
Oh, Brahman, I stand consecrated just by your graceful glance, and oh, great saint, 
I reckon that I have achieved many boons just glancing at you. 
Oh, great-resplendent Brahman, myself and the noble souled Rama have heard about 
your great ascesis when Sage Shataananda extolled it comprehensively. 
The congregationalists available in this Vedic-ritual congregation have also heard 
about your numerous endowments. Inestimable is your ascesis, infinite is your power, 
and oh, son of Kushika, your talents are everlastingly invaluable. 
Oh, lord, there is no contentment to me while listening to your wondrous narratives, 
but oh nobleman, time for vespertine ritual is fast approaching as sun's sphere 
is dangling westward. 
"Oh, great-resplendent sage, it will be apt of you to see me tomorrow. Oh, best 
meditator, it will be apt of you to permit me to leave for now." Thus Janaka sought 
leave from Vishvamitra. 
When he is spoken in that way, the best saint Vishvamitra is pleased at heart, and 
praising Janaka, who too is pleased to meet the sage, immediately bid farewell to 
the best one among men, namely Janaka. 
This way on saying to the best saint, the king of Mithila and the legatee of Videha 
lineage, immediately performed circumambulations along with his teachers and relatives 
to Vishvamitra in veneration. 
Even that virtue souled Vishvamitra started towards his own camp along with Rama 
and Lakshmana, while being venerated by great sages who are available in the ritual-hall. 
"Oh, Rambha, now you have to undertake this very great task of gods in enchanting Vishvamitra with 
a craving caused by lust, for lusting after you.' Thus Indra ordered Rambha..." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama. 
Oh, Rama, when that celestial wench is spoken thus by the Thousand-eyed Indra, she diffidently said 
to that chief of gods while adjoining her palms suppliantly. 
'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, that great saint Vishvamitra is a dangerous one and undoubtedly he releases 
his deadly anger on me. Oh, god, thereby I am fearful of him. Hence, oh, god, it will be apt of you 
to accord forbearance.' So said Rambha to Indra. 
Oh, Rama, the Thousand-eyed Indra replied Rambha when she spoke to him in that way while shuddering 
in fear and making palm fold in supplication. 
You need not be fearful, Rambha, carry out my command, safe betides you, I on becoming a heart-stealing 
black-songbird will be at your side along with Love-god in the pleasing trees of springtime. 
'Indeed on your assuming a highly sparkling semblance, and multi-multiplexing your savoir faire, with 
bon viveurs and bon vivants, you disengage that ascetical sage Kaushika from his ascesis.' So said Indra 
to Rambha. 
On hearing the sentence of Indra she adopted an unexcelled physique, and on becoming a pulchritudinous 
damsel she started to entice Vishvamitra with giggly grins. 
Vishvamitra has heard melodious trilling tune of songbird, and while his heart is highly gladdening 
about the ambience, he incidentally saw and stared at Rambha. 
By the exceptional trilling tune of that songbird and by the unexceptional tableau of Rambha the sage 
is on his qui vive. 
On knowing that as an escapade of the Thousand-eyed Indra, Vishvamitra is enwrapped in wrath and he 
cursed Rambha. 
Whereof you tried to entice me who am wishing to win over the wanton and wroth, you unlucky female 
Rambha, thereof you will become a rocklike statued wastrel. 
'A highly resplendent Brahman who is ascetically powerful redeems you, oh, Rambha, who are now blemished 
by my anger.' Vishvamitra cursed Rambha in this way. 
Thus the great-resplendent Vishvamitra became compunctious when that great-saint could not contain 
his anger in uttering an angry curse. 
Then Rambha has become a rocklike statue by that great curse of Vishvamitra, and having heard the words 
of that great-saint Love-god and Indra also took flight. 
Owing to his angering that great-resplendent Vishvamitra is now divested of his ascetical merit, and 
he has no peace of mind owing to ungovernable senses. 
His conscience became sentimental owing to the divesture of his ascetical merit, and he soliloquised, 
'I shall not succumb to wrath in anyway, nor I put my presentiment into words.' 
Otherwise, I do not even respire for a hundred years for the respiratory gestures will also exhibit 
moods, and I indeed emaciate myself until I become a real conqueror of my own senses. 
'Till such time as I acquire Brahman-hood with the merit of my own ascesis I will be breathless and 
foodless, even if it is going to take endless years, and while I am in ascesis my bodily organs indeed 
will not undergo any deterioration.' So said Vishvamitra to himself. 
"Thus that eminent sage abided by the commitment to the vow for a thousand years, oh, Rama, the legatee 
of Ragu, which is a nonpareil vow in the world." Thus Shataananda continued. "When thousand years are completed in ascesis and when that great saint Vishvamitra 
took a bath of solemnity, all the gods have come forward wishing to accord the fruit 
of that ascesis to Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. 

The very highly resplendent Brahma spoke to him with highly palatable words, 'you 
have now become a kingly sage by virtue of auspicious deeds you have personally 
undertaken, let safeness betide you.' 
On speaking to Vishvamitra in that way Brahma returned to heaven, and that highly 
vigorous Vishvamitra again performed a great ascesis. 
Then at a long lost time Menaka, the prominent apsara, celestial wench, has arrived 
and started to swim for sport in that holy lake. 
That great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has seen Menaka who is incomparable in 
her mien and comparable to an electric-flash in a black-cloud, while she is swimming 
in the holy lake. 
On seeing her the sage having gone under the sway the Love-god said this to her, 
'oh, apsara, you are welcome, I invite you to bide in my hermitage. Oblige me who 
am bewitched by Love-god for you. You be safe.' 
When he said thus to her, oh, Raghava, then she made a stopover there and ten years 
rolled by comfortably, and oh, gentle Rama, because of her staying Vishvamitra is 
indeed faced with a great hindrance in his ascesis. 
Then after the lapse of that ten year period Vishvamitra became doleful with distress 
and he is enwrapped in humiliation, as it were, and, oh, Rama, Raghu's legatee, 
then a resentful thought occurred to him. 
All this is the mischief of gods to defraud me of the great merit of my ascesis. 
Ten years have rolled by as if they are just a day and a night. Furthermore, I who 
am under the influence of lust and lure had to encounter this hindrance in my ascesis. 

Oh, Rama, that best saint suspired heavily when he became emotional with reparation. 
But on seeing the scared celestial wench Menaka, who is shivering and waiting with 
suppliantly adjoined palms, he sent her away with pleasant words, and he that Vishvamitra 
indeed went to the northern Himalayan mountain. 
He that highly celebrated sage who made a resolve to attain a sang-froid temperament 
and to vanquish lust, performed an unsurpassable ascesis on reaching the riverbank 
of River Kaushiki. 
Oh, Rama, while he reverently performed an unspeakable ascesis for a thousand years 
on the northern mountain, namely Himalayas, then fear occurred to gods. 
' All gods coming together with assemblages of sages have approached Brahma and conveyed 
that, 'this Vishvamitra, the son of Kushika, may duly be given the epithet of 'Maharshi, 
Exalted Sage.' 
On listening the advice of gods, Brahma, the Grandparent of all the worlds, spoke 
these pleasant words to the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra. 
'Oh, exalted sage, I welcome you my dear, as I am gladdened by your stern ascesis, 
oh, Kaushika, I bestow upon you the sublimity and supremacy among sages.' 
And on hearing the words of Brahma he that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra became 
obeisant and replied the Grandparent adjoining his palms suppliantly. 
'If your Godhead had said that I am a Brahma-sage, a sageship acquired personally 
by my pious deeds, rather than an exalted sage, then I would have become one who 
is really self-conquered.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Brahma. 
Brahma then said to him, 'your senses remain unconquered as such, oh, tigerly sage, 
make an effort for it.' Saying so Brahma went heavenward. 
While the gods who came here along with Brahma have returned, that great sage Vishvamitra 
undertook another round of ascesis by standing in levitation, upraising his arms, 
and subsisting on air alone. 
In summer he became the Five-Fire Ascetic, in rainy season open sky is his rooftop, 
and in winter water is his reclining bed even by day or by night, and thus that 
ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra indeed undertook a severe ascesis in this way, for 
another thousand years. 
While that great saint is undertaking fervent ascesis it has become a very high 
burning problem to gods and even to Indra. 
"Then Indra along with all the assemblages of the Air-gods spoke to Rambha, the 
celestial wench, words that are advantageous to himself, but disadvantageous to 
the son of sage Kushi, namely Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration. When Brahmadatta has married and left, oh, Raghava, king Kushanaabha he embarked 
on Vedic-ritual calledputrakaameSThiin order to 
beget a son because is sonless. 
During the performance of the ritual, supremely generous Kusha, the brainchild of 
Brahma and the father of Kushanaabha, spoke to the king Kushanaabha. 
" 'Oh, son, there will be a highly virtuous and selfsame son of yours, known as 
Gaadhi, and through him you also will get everlasting renown in the world.' " Thus 
Kusha said to Kushanaabha. 
"Saying so, oh, Rama, Kushanaabha's father Kusha entered the sky and journeyed to 
the time-honoured abode of Brahma. 
"Then after some time that highly intellectual Kushanaabha begot a supremely righteous 
son known by the name Gaadhi. 
"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, that eminently righteous Gaadhi is my father, and 
since I am born in Kusha dynasty, oh, Raghu's legatee, I got the name Kaushika." 
Sage Vishvamitra thus narrating to Rama. 
"Even my elder sister who undertook benevolent vows and who is renowned by her name 
Satyavathi is there, oh, Raghava, and she is given in marriage to sage Ruchika. 

"She journeyed to heaven with her body while she followed her departed husband and 
being a very generous lady she coursed as a great river renowned as River Kaushiki. 

"Desiring to yield benefit for the welfare of world, my sister has emerged with 
her divinely pious and delightful waters, taking recourse to Himalayan Mountains. 

"Thereby, oh, Rama, I am delightfully and abidingly residing on the mountainsides 
of Himalayas, in adjacency of my sister Kausiki in all my affection for her. 
"She that Satyavathi for her part is a pious one, steadfast in truthfulness and 
righteousness, a husband devote, and such a highly fortunate one has emerged as 
a best river among rivers, namely River Kaushiki. 
"Owing to my vow, oh, Rama, I left her for a while and came to the Accomplished 
Hermitage and owing to your magnificence I have become accomplished in that vow 
of mine. 
"Oh, dextrous Rama, this is all about my dynasty, my province on which we are presently 
camping namely the riverbanks of Sona, and about my birth, and thus everything is 
narrated as you have asked me. 
"By telling these legends it is past midnight, oh, Kakutstha, you get some sleep. 
Safe you be! Let no hindrance occur for us halfway on our pathway. 
"Oh, Raghu's delight, trees are standstill... animals and birds have slouched... 
nightly sombre has pervaded all the confines. 
"Eventide lapsed slowly and the vault of heaven filled with stars and starlets is 
splendorous as though orbs of heaven are overspread on its vault. 
"Also, dissipating the darkness of the world with his brilliance, the moon with 
coolant moonbeams is rising up, gladdening the hearts of worldly beings. 
"Now, the bands of yaksha-s, demons, even the ferocious ogres that feed on raw flesh, 
why them, all the beings that take pleasure in nights are astir, far and wide." 
So said Vishvamitra to Rama. 
Saying so that greatly resplendent and eminent saint Vishvamitra paused, and then 
all the other sages have revered him saying, "well-said, well-said." 
"Sublime is this lineage of Kusha dynasty which always dedicated itself to righteousness, 
and the dynasty of Kusha are the best ones among mankind, and they symbolise with 
god Brahma himself, thus they are highly reverential." Thus the other sages have 
applauded Vishvamitra and his dynasty. 
"You alone are exemplarily selfsame to Brahma, oh, Vishvamitra of great-renown, 
and among rivers that prominent River Kaushiki is your sister, thus she is glorifying 
your ancestry." Thus the sages lauded Vishvamitra. 
Sage Vishvamitra is pleased when those tigerly sages have laude him, and then that 
magnificent sage Vishvamitra lapsed into the lap of sleep, as the sun lapses into 
lap of dusk for that day. 
Even Rama with a little astonishment coming upon him, applauding that tigerly-sage, 
and glided into the lap of sleep along with Soumitri. Oh, valiant Rama of Dasharatha, your valour is bruited as a sensational valour, and sensational is your smashing of Shiva's 
bow, also thus I have thoroughly heard about your others deeds like elimination of Tataka et cetera... 
That way, smashing of that particular bow of Shiva is wondrous and even unimaginable... on hearing that alone I happened 
upon you, bringing another outranking bow... 
This alone is that catastrophic bow received through Sage Jamadagni... flex it with an arrow on bowstring stretching up 
to your ear, and in that way show your capability... 
"Thereby, on examining your strength in your taking aim with this bow, and should you be deservedly valorous, I will give 
you a combative duel..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. 
On hearing that sentence of Bhaargava Rama, then king Dasharatha became a pitiable one, and with a downcast face and adjoined 
palms said this. 
Aren't you a Brahman with inviolable ascesis, and whose rancour on Kshatriya-s has calmed down long back. Why this hostility 
again. It'll be apt of you to award aegis to my sons, for they are yet youngsters... 
Aren't you from the bloodline of Bhaargava-s who always conduct themselves in self-study of Vedas and self-principled ways... 
haven't you readily discarded weapon-wielding on your promise to Thousand-eyed Indra... 
Such as you were, you on becoming a dedicatee to probity, haven't you given the planet earth to Kashyapa and haven't you 
repaired to forests, and haven't you flagged yourself on Mt. Mahendra... 
"Or, oh, insurmountable sage, have you chanced upon us for a total annihilation of ours... when Rama is singularised and 
eliminated, nay-said that we all will be living..." Thus Dasharatha had gone on appealing in his love for his sons. 
While Dasharatha is speaking in that way that intransigent Bhaargava Rama of Sage Jamadagni uncaring for those merciful 
words of Dasharatha addressed Rama of Dasharatha alone. 
These are the two strong and sturdy unsurpassed longbows, well-designed by gods and well-crafted by Vishvakarma, the Divine 
Architect, and these are very important among all bows and well-worshipped by all worlds... one broken in your, and the 
other in my hand... 
Oh, best one among men, out of the two longbows gods gave one to restive Trymbaka, God Shiva for a combat with demon Tripura, 
and oh, Kakutstha, that bow alone is the annihilator of Tripura, the demon... and you have broken that alone... 
This is the second one and the choicest gods gave this to Vishnu, thereby this is named after Him as 'Vishnu's bow...' 
this is an indestructible and enemy-citadel conquering longbow... and this is identical in its efficacy with Rudra's longbow... 

Once, all the gods were asking the Grandparent, Brahma, as to who is powerful and who is less powerful among the blue-throated 
Shiva and Vishnu... but the Grandparent Brahma on inferring the intent of gods started to create adversity among those two, 
Shiva and Vishnu, for the Grandparent is the best adherer of truthfulness, as truth cannot be demonstrated on hearsay evidence... 

Legend:Brahma thought that it would better to enact a drama to cleanse the one-sided mentalities 
of these lesser gods. So, he started to write the script, and himself becoming the writer-director of that drama. That script 
is hereunder.
Brahma: Mahadeva, who is the destroyer of Tripura, or say triple-citadels?
Shiva: Why? It is me, of course...
Brahma: Why do you boast that way of yourself? It is the long-arrow of your longbow, isn't it?
Shiva: Yes of course...
Brahma: Then Vishnu was presiding deity of that long-bow... isn't t?
Shiva: Yes, it is he, but I shot it from my bow... basically, is this a confusion, or, are you playing any part of Narada...
Brahma: Not so, the other day Vishnu was telling that he alone did that master task...
Shiva: How can it be! In the triple of doer-deed-instrument, instrument cannot become the doer... has his language gone 
topsy-turvy, noun is becoming verb and verb is lost to adjective and...
Brahma: Ok, Ok... we do not care much for grammar as we care more for communication, grammar is paNini's headache... but 
what he said is that he alone did it... not you...
Shiva: Then why I am called... why that longbow is given to me... you should have got it done by Vishnu... 
why calling me... you have unnecessarily 
spoiled my dance program...
Brahma: Not that... I said what he said... let's not quarrel among ourselves...
Shiva: I not only quarrel but wage war, if it comes to my interests and my devotees' interest... how many times I have not 
done so...
Brahma: That is what Vishnu was telling... every time you give a boon to every demon, and involve yourself in enmeshment, 
and Vishnu has come to come and rescue... have he forgotten the episode of bhasmaasura... thus Vishnu is saying and asking...
Shiva: Now I don't tolerate... I will take him to task...
Exit Shiva - Enter Vishnu. Brahma reverses the above dialogue and says that to Vishnu
Vishnu: No, No, highly objectionable... I will take him to task... I will take him to task...
Exit All. War Started.
Owing to their animosity then occurred a fierce and hair-raising war among Shiva and Vishnu, as each aspired victory for 
himself... 
By the 'hum' sound of Vishnu that ruinously overpowering longbow of Shiva is broken, and the triple-eyed God, Mahadeva, 
is frozen... 
Then gods along with the assemblages of sages and celestial carana-s have come together and appealed to those two for appeasement 
in the matter of wielding authority, and then those two superior gods, Shiva and Vishnu, went into a state of amity... 
"On seeing the bow of Shiva rendered inert by the mettlesomeness of Vishnu, from then on the gods along with the assemblages 
of sages deemed Vishnu to be the paramount... 
That celebrated Rudra on his part with indignation has handed over that longbow, which is already fitted with unloosened 
arrow, to the sagely king among Videha kings, namely Devaraata... 
Oh, Rama, this alone is that enemy-citadel conquering longbow of Vishnu, and Vishnu handed over this to Sage Riciika, the 
son of Bhrigu, as a trustworthy trust... 
That great-resplendent Sage Riciika on his part has handed over this divine bow to his son with unmatchable deeds of religious 
merit, who is my father Sage Jamadagni... 
Adhering to a barbarous mentality Kaartaviirya Arjuna put my father to death, when the ascetically powerful father of 
mine has isolated himself from arsenal... 
Oh, Rama, on hearing the unregenerate and highly perfidious murdering of my father, I rancorously extirpated Kshatriya-s 
as and when they are born, that too not for one time, but I did so for thirty-seven times going around the earth... and 
on getting the entire earth under my control I performed Vedic-ritual, and at the end of that Vedic-ritual, I gave all that 
earth to sage Kashyapa, a sage with divine soul and with pious observances, as a ritualistic-generosity... and I am at present 
on Mt. Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me... 
On hearing about the breakage of Shiva's longbow, then I promptly came here. Thereby, oh, Rama, wield this supernatural 
and superlative longbow of Vishnu, which is passed on to me from my forefathers and my father. Keep your fealty to Kshatriya-hood 
in view, and wield this as you have wielded Shiva's longbow... 
Take an aim with an arrow that conquers enemy's citadels fixing it on this supramundane longbow... and oh, Kakutstha, should 
you be capable of it, thereafter I will give you a duel... "Oh, tigerly man Rama, on giving farewell to those sages who came at his invitation 
and who have started to go back after the ritual of Trishanku is over, then that 
great-resplendent Vishvamitra spoke to all of the sages who are forest dwellers 
that remained with him." Thus Shatananda continued to narrate the legend of Vishvamitra. 

While depending on this southern quarter this gross hindrance has cropped up 
for my ascesis in the shape of Trishanku's ascent to heaven, hence we will go to 
another direction, and there we continue ascesis. 
'Oh, great-souled sages, we can conveniently undertake our ascesis in the vast 
of westerly direction where holy lakesides are there. That would be an august ascetical 
forest, isn't it.' Thus Vishvamitra said to fellow sages in his camp. 
On saying thus that most brilliant and great saint Vishvamitra performed an unhindered 
and rigorous ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers after reaching the lakeside 
of holy lakes. 
In the meanwhile the great king of Ayodhya, renowned as Ambariisha, embarked on 
to perform a Vedic-ritual. 
But Indra impounded the animal of the principal of that ritual, namely king Ambariisha, 
and when that animal is really vanished, the officiant Brahman of the ritual spoke 
this to that king. 
Oh, king, the animal you have fetched for the ritual has gone astray owing to 
your incautiousness. Oh, king, unguarded items of the ritual will themselves become 
destructive blemishes for that king who is performing the ritual. 
'Oh, the best man among men, you have to make great amends for the loss of animal 
as that animal alone which was intended but now missing shall be used in ritual. 
Or, a man may be fetched as ritual-animal, and only after that the deeds of the 
ritual can be continued.' Thus, the priests of the ritual said to king Ambariisha. 

On hearing the words of his teacher, oh, the best one among men, Rama, he that 
highly rule-obedient king tried for a human-ritual-animal for a barter of thousands 
of cows. 
While that king is searching those and those provinces, villages, forests, townships, 
and even the pious hermitages, oh, dear Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, that 
king has indeed seen Sage Riciika, who is well settled on Mt. Bhrigutunga along 
with his sons and wife. 
On reverencing and on obtaining the grace of ascetically brilliant great Sage Riciika, 
and even on asking him about his wellbeing in every aspect, that kingly sage Ambariisha, 
who is with great resplendence and whose brilliance is illimitable, said this word 
to that sage. 
Oh, godlike sage, if you bargain your son with a hundred thousand cows for the 
purpose of a ritual-animal, oh, the successor Sage Bhrigu, I deem my ends are achieved. 

'All the provinces are went over but unobtainable is that animal of the ritual, 
hence it will be apt of you to give me one son from among your sons, for a value.' 
Thus, king Ambariisha bargained with the sage. 
When that great-resplendent Sage Riciika is addressed thus, he said this word, 
'oh, best of men, I cannot possibly sell my eldest son, in anyway.' 
On hearing the words of Sage Riciika the mother of those great-souled sons spoke 
this word to the tigerly-man Ambariisha. 
The most reverential sage and the one from Bhaargava dynasty, my husband, said 
that the eldest son is un-sellable. Thereof oh, lord, you must know that my youngest 
son, namely Shunaka, is a cherished one for me. Therefore oh, king, I will not give 
my youngest son to you, either. 
'Generally eldest sons are fathers' favourites, oh, best king among men, and mothers' 
favourites are the youngest, isn't it! Therefor, I have to tend my youngest son.' 
Thus, wife Sage Ruciika said to Ambariisha. 
Oh, Rama, when that sage's sentence is so, and his wife's sentence is also in that 
way only, their intermediate son, namely Shunashepa, personally spoke this sentence. 

Father said that the eldest son is un-sellable, mother also said the same about 
youngest one. Then I deem that the intermediary son is sellable. Hence, oh, prince, 
you may lead me forth. 
Oh, dextrous Rama, when that advocate of Veda-s, namely Shunashepa finished his 
speech, then the king gave gold, silver, and gemstones, each in ten million heaps, 
and even a hundred thousand cows, and oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that king Ambariisha 
went away highly gladdened to take Shunashepa with him. 
"That great resplendent and highly renowned king Ambariisha on his part proceeded 
hastily after ascending Shunashepa onto the chariot that hastily." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration. Hearing the auspicious words thus spoken by Rama, Lord Shiva the Supreme Lord
thereupon delivered the following still more beautiful speech:
"O lotus-eyed, long-armed, broad-chested, annihilator of enemies and excellent among
those upholding the cause of virtue! Thank heaven! You accomplished this task."
"Fortunately has the fear born of Ravana - which increased the severe darkness on
the entire world has been removed by you, on the battle-field, O Rama!"
"You are fit to go to the heaven, by comforting the depressed Bharata and the
illustrious Kausalya as well as seeing Kaikeyi and Sumitra, the mother of Lakshmana having got the
sovereignty of Ayodhya, bringing delight to your friends, stabilizing the back-bone in the race of
Ikshvaku, getting excellent glory by performing a horse-sacrifice and by granting riches to
Brahmanas."
"This king Dasaratha, your father in this mortal world and the highly glorious as
well as the venerable person, is seated in an aerial car, O Rama!"
"Having been delivered by you, his (godly) son, the glorious king obtained the abode
of Indra the lord of celestials. you offer your respectful salutation to him, along with Lakshmana,
your brother."
Hearing the words of Shiva, Rama along with Lakshmana his brother, offered their
salutation to their father, seated on the topmost part of an aerial car.
The lord Rama along with Lakshmana his brother saw their father, who was blazing
with his own splendour and clad in brilliant garments.
Then the king Dasaratha the lord who was sitting in the aerial car, in an excellent
seat, was filled with excessive delight to see his son (Rama), who was dearer to him than life.
Placing him in his lap and embracing him in his arms, he thereupon commenced his speech as
follows:
"O Rama! Separated from you, the heaven is not a liking to me, nor the respect given
to me by the foremost of celestials. I am telling you the truth."
"Today, there is a great joy for me, for having seen you, fully satisfied in your
mind, now that your enemies have been destroyed and you have fully gone through the period of
exile."
"O excellent among the eloquent! The words, which were uttered by Kaikeyi, with an
aim to send you into exile, are still imprinted in my heart."
"Seeing you in a fine fettle with Lakshmana and hugging you today, I stand
completely rid of sorrow - even as the sun is freed from mist."
"O great-souled son! I have been redeemed by you, my worthy son, even as Kahola a
brahmana was redeemed by Ashtavakra."
"O gently one! I recognize you now to be the Supreme person, duly enjoined here by
the rulers of gods, for the destruction of Ravana."
"Blessed indeed is Kausalya, who will see you, the destroyer of your enemies,
returned home from the forest."
"Blessed indeed are those men, who will see you returned to the City of Ayodhya and
consecrated on the throne as a lord of the earth."
"I desire to see you, re-united with the mighty Bharata, who is affectionate towards
you, honest and virtuous."
"O gentle one! You spent fourteen years, residing in the forest with Lakshmana and
Seetha."
"You completed the term of your exile. My pledge was implemented by you. The
celestials too have been fully gratified, by your killing of Ravana in battle."
"O the destroyer of enemies! A laudable act has been done and glory has been earned
by you. Getting consecrated on the throne, may you attain a long life, along with your
brothers."
To Dasaratha, who was thus speaking, Rama with joined palms in salutation, submitted
(as follows): "Be gracious to Kaikeyi and Bharata, O the knower of virtues!"
You will remember those words spoken by you saying, I disown you, with your son
(Bharata)'. May that terrific curse not touch Kaikeyi and her son, O Lord!"
Saying 'May it be" to Rama who stood with joined palms embraced Lakshmana. Dasaratha
again uttered the following words to Lakshmana:
"A great gratification has been rendered to me and reward in the form of religious
merit earned by you in that you served Rama and Seetha, the princess of Videha kingdom, with
devotion."
"Rama, being pleased with you, you will attain religious merit and extensive glory
on earth, as also heaven and excellent power O knower of righteousness!"
"Happiness to you, O the augmentor of the joy of Sumitra, your mother! Serve Rama
well. Rama forever is intent on advancing the interests of the entire world."
"These three worlds, including Indra Siddhas (a class of demi-gods) and great sages
pay homage to the great-souled Rama as a Supreme person, on approaching him."
"O great one! O the destroyer of adversaries! Rama has been spoken of as the
unmanifest and the imperishable Brahama (the absolute), established by the Vedas, the heart of gods
and the secret of all gods."
"Having served him, along with Seetha with devotion, you obtained the reward of the
practice of all virtues as also celebrity, abundantly."
Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the (former) king, addressing his daughter-in-law
standing before him with joined palms as "My daughter", slowly and affectionately advised her as
follows:
"No wrath indeed should be rendered by you towards Rama, for having repudiated you.
This has been done by him, wishing for your welfare and in order to demostrate your purity."
"This act (of entering into fire) which has been done by you and which reveals your
true character, my daughter, is the most difficult task to perform for other ladies and will
overshadow their illustriousness."
"You need not be instructed about the matter of rendering service to your husband.
But, it is to be told certainly by me. He is your supreme deity."
Having instructed thus to his sons and Seetha, the King Dasaratha who was born in
Raghu dynasty went to the abode of Indra, the lord of celestials, by an aerial car.
With a satisfied self, Dasaratha the excellent king of noble-mindedness endowed with
splendour, taking leave of his sons and Seetha and mounting the aerial car, went to the abode of
Indra, the chief of gods.That slender-waisted Seetha whose limbs are flawless, whose complexion is like purified gold, and who 
is presently culling flowers is highly gladdened to observe the Golden Deer that is brightened in one 
flank with the colour of gold and the other is silvery, and she shouted for attention of her husband, 
and even that of Lakshmana who is presently weaponed. 
"Oh, noble prince, come here," thus she called her husband and peered at the deer, and again she called, 
"really come with your younger brother quickly," and again gazed at the deer, and thus she oftentimes 
called and oftentimes saw the deer fondly. 
Those manly lions Rama and Lakshmana thus bidden by Vaidehi came there exploring that place and then 
they saw that Golden Deer. 
But Lakshmana became incredulous on seeing it and said to Rama, "I believe this deer to be that Maareecha, 
the demon." 
"Oh, Rama, when kings engaged in hunting games were delightedly moving in the forest, this Maareecha 
killed many of them resorting to many disguises, for he is a guise-changer by his wish. 
"Maareecha is an expert in many wiles and he has now assumed the form of this Golden-Deer, oh, manly 
lion, which is not more than the scintillating city of Gandharva-s, a city of wiles, which any trickster 
can create to make-believe. 
"Oh, Raghava, this kind of amazing animal with gemlike dapples is nonexistent in the world, isn't it. 
Hence, oh, lord of the world, this is truly a phantasm. No doubt about it." So said Lakshmana to Rama. 

While Lakshmana of Kakutstha-s is speaking thus, she who is self-satisfied as her heart is conjured 
by the cozenage, such a Seetha of a toothy smile deterred him and spoke. 
"Oh, nobleman's son, that delightful deer is stealing my heart, oh, dextrous one, bring it round, it 
will be our plaything. 
"Here in the threshold of our hermitage many animals with adorable manifestation are moving about in 
flocks and herds, say Caamara deer, like that Srimara deer. 
"Also the animals that are excellent in their form, say monkeys, are moving here. Likewise herds of 
Kinnara deer, spotted-deer, and even bears of great-might are freely moving here. 
"As to how this extraordinary deer is appearing, oh, king, by way of its brilliance, tameness, or by 
the lustre of its skin, I have not so far seen any coequal to this. 
"Diversely coloured, amazingly limbed, and spotted with gemlike dapples it is shining forth like a deer 
that is completely gemmy, and while nonchalantly moving before me it is enlivening the forest like the 
moon. 
"Ah, what a form, ah, what a brilliance, what a beautiful bleat! This amazingly limbed deer is wonderful, 
and this is stealing my heart, as it were. 
"It will be surprising if this deer draws into your capture alive and well, as it creates astonishment 
to one and all. 
"When we return to kingdom on completing our dwelling in forest this deer becomes a masterpiece in palace-chambers 
for us. 
"Oh, lord, the form of this deer creates an excellent jubilation to Bharata, to you the son of the nobleman, 
to my mothers-in-law, and also to me in palace-chambers. 
"Else if that best deer does not come into you capture while alive, oh tigerly-man, at the least its 
gorgeous deerskin will be remnant of it. 
"I wish to sit along with you on its golden deerskin, overlaying it on a seat of tender darbha grass-blades, 
in case the deer is felled. 
"Tradition says that this sort of unruly self-seeking is unbefitting to women, yet that deer's beautiful 
body is inducing curiosity in me." Seetha said so to Rama and remained waiting for his reply. 
As for that deer's horns they vie with excellent sapphires, its golden coat with the glitter of tender 
sun, and its ambience with silver spots on coat with a milk way containing twinkling stars, and by that 
reason even Raghava's heart is awestruck when he saw it. 
In this way, hearing the words of Seetha and observing that wondrous deer Raghava is also amused by 
its form, and even motivated by Seetha in fetching it, he delightedly spoke this word to his brother 
Lakshmana. 
"Lakshmana, behold this enthusiastic delight of Vaidehi. Oh, Soumitri, presently no other deer indeed 
with such an excellent form exists in this forest. Or else, does it exist in Nandana Gardens of Indra 
- no, it cannot be there; in the adjoins of Caitraratha Gardens of Kubera - no, it will not be there, 
then how can there be some deer on earth which is similar to this! 
"Amazing are its hairlines with hair upturned at some places and down-turned at other, and the golden 
spots embedded on the coat of the deer are glittery. 
"See at its tongue that is exserting from its mouth while it is yawning, which is similar to the flaring 
tongue of fire and to the lightning from a cloud. 
"Its face is like a mug made up of sapphires, its paunch is pearly and conchoidal, and whose heart is 
it that will not lured for this deer with an inexplicable beauty. 
"On seeing at this astounding look of the deer which is golden in glitter and bejewelled numerously 
as it were, whose heart is it that will not be transported into astonishment. 
"Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the 
sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery. 
"And exerting themselves in great forests they by far amass forest produce, ores, jewels, gemstones 
and the gravel of gold. 
"Everything of that wealth from forest produce will be filling the treasuries of kings, like the speculated 
objects filling the entire treasury of Shukra just by his thinking of them in his mind. 
"The financial experts and the other financially well-off people say that with which aspirational activity 
an aspirant unhesitatingly scurries and achieves it, that achieved target alone is lauded to be worthwhile, 
or, as real wealth. 
"This comely Vaidehi will be sitting on that invaluable golden skin of that gem of a deer along with 
me. 
"I think the skin of Kadali deer, or of Priyaki deer, or of Praveni deer, or as a matter of fact the 
skins of best breed of deer or sheep will not be match to the deerskin of this deer, insofar as the 
soft-touch is concerned. 
"Only two divine deer are there, this magnificent deer on earth, and the other that moves in skies remaining 
in stellar region. 
"You are telling me that 'this is the wizardry of the demon.' Even then, Lakshmana, if this results 
in that way as a demon's wizardry, my duty also results in the elimination of that deer. 
"If this deer is Maareecha, this heinous and vicious-souled demon has indeed tortured many eminent sages 
earlier when was on the prowl in the forests, thus he is eliminable. 
"He rebelliously killed many kings who are excellent archers while they were in hunting games, at least 
for that reason this bestial monster is eradicable. 
"Demon Vaataapi who held ascetics in contempt was here earlier, and staying in the stomachs of Brahmans 
he used to come out by ripping their stomachs open and thus he was killing Brahmans, like a mare-calf 
killing its own mother at its time of birth by ripping the womb of its own mother. 
"On one occasion after some time, that Vaataapi avariciously obtained that great-saint and the one who 
is endowed with effulgent, namely Agastya, as an eatable, but actually that demon has became an eatable 
to the sage. 
"On observing the demon Vaataapi who is trying to assume his original form of demon in order to come 
out of his stomach, that godly saint Agastya spoke this to Vaataapi with a scornful smile. 
" 'Oh, Vaataapi, you have irreverently eradicated the best Brahmans in this world owing to your might, 
therefore I have assimilated you.' So said sage Agastya to Vaataapi. 
"Lakshmana, such a demon who is like Vaataapi will not be there any more. He who disregards someone 
of my kind, who always abides in righteousness and who is self-controlled, such a demon will be eliminated 
as sage Agastya has eliminated demon Vaataapi, if that demon happens to get at me. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, you stay here in all preparedness and guard Maithili steadfastly, 
whatever enterprise of ours is there that is founded in her. 
"I wish to catch this deer, Soumitri, if not I will kill it, and I will be going forthwith to fetch 
the deer. 
"Lakshmana, see how Vaidehi's percept is overtaken by deerskin. Indeed by the strangeness of its skin 
that deer must be a mysterious being, hence, it will not survive now. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, apply yourself vigilantly while staying in hermitage along with Seetha. So soon as I 
go I will be felling that spotted deer with one arrow and returning quickly. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, you be here taking care of Maithili along with the forthright, formidable and fatherly 
bird Jatayu, and be watchful and suspicious from everywhere and every split-second." Thus Rama spoke 
to Lakshmana and started to go after the deer When Ravana perversely ordered that way in all his kingliness, Maareecha spoke these
words caustically and frankly to that king of demons. 
"Oh, night-walker, by which evildoer this thought, which is self-ruinous to you,
along with your progeny, kingdom and ministers put together, is taught to you? 
"Who is that reprobate unhappy with such a happy one like you, and oh, king, by whom
this door of demise is ingeniously shown to you? 
"It is very clear, oh, night-walker, that your rivals with skimpy might are aspiring
that you should be completely ruined coming into conflict with more mighty Rama. 
"He who wishes you to get ruined by your undertaking a self-made destruction is a
scoundrel with a pernicious intent, as such, by whom you are counselled to do this? 
"Your ministers are not curbing you anywise when you scramble on a high road to
self-ruination, hence they are indeed to be sentenced to death, but they are not being executed for
their dereliction. 
"Veracious ministers have to restrain a self-willed king when he relies on a
wrong-route, isn't it. But you are unrestrained by your ministers though you are self-willed and
though you are taking a wrong-route. 
"Oh, best conqueror Ravana, probity, prosperity and pleasures, and even the
popularity of the ministers, oh, night-walker, are achieved at the beneficence of their master.

"Contrariwise, oh, Ravana, all that beneficence of the king to ministers becomes
futile when the king behaves perversely, and even the others, namely the subjects of kingdom, will
derive distress by the negative virtue of their master. 
"The king alone is the root cause for probity and prosperity, isn't it. Therefore,
oh, best prosperous one, in all situations the kings are to be safeguarded from the ill effects of
influences. 
"It is impossible to govern kingdom, oh, demon, the night-walker, for a king with
acridity, with hostility, or with immorality. 
"The ministers with drastic notions will indeed fall apart together with their king,
like a chariot that gets ramshackled together with it charioteer on a rough road, though it is
hieing with galloping horses but badly controlled by that slothful charioteer. 
"In the world many saintly beings that are high-minded and pursuers of ethicality
are completely ruined together with their kinsmen owing to the misdeeds of others. 
"Oh, Ravana, the subjects do not flourish while a lord with contrariety and
coerciveness safeguards them, just like goats guarded by a fox. 
"All those demons will definitely ruin, oh, Ravana, to whom you are the acrimonious
and malicious king with unconquered senses, though you have conquered the heaven. 
"What is the use of laming for myself as I foregathered this ghastly situation as in
crow-palm-tree syndrome, but in this issue you alone are regrettable, for you are gong to
completely ruin along with your military. 
"That Rama will soon kill you after killing me, and I will be dying at the hand of
my enemy rather than at the hand of my own clansman like you, whereby the purpose of my life will
be brought to an end. 
"Know that I am killed just when Rama notices me, and know that you are also killed
along with your kinsmen just when you steal Seetha. 
"If you are going to bring Seetha from their hermitage on going there with me, then
you will not be there, I will not be there, Lanka will not be there, the demons will not be there.

"As a desirer of your welfare I am dissuading you, oh, night-walker, but you may
feel that this word of mine is unpleasant to you. People on diminishing lifetime will be similar to
corpses and a corpse cannot take in the expedient spoken by considerate confidants, isn't so.
"Thus I was somehow released by him in a confrontation then in his teens. Now you
may also listen to what has happened later in his adulthood." Thus Maareecha continued his advise
to Ravana. 
"Though Rama hit me previously in such a way, I unabashedly entered Dandaka forest
together with two more demons who were in the guise of animals. 
"On becoming a gigantic carnivorous animal with a torching tongue, incisive teeth
and excruciating horns, and with an extraordinary energy, I was on the rove in Dandaka forest while
getting at Rama. 
"I moved about Dandaka forest, oh, Ravana, in an extremely horrible aspect of
animal, utterly brutalising the sages at ritual-altars, holy bathing places and under the trees of
religious sanctuaries while reaching Rama. 
"I have proceeded to Rama killing saints in Dandaka forest who are the treaders in
saintliness, and drinking off their blood and feasting on their flesh. 
"On becoming such a brutal animal I have been eating the flesh of sages, frightening
the forest dwellers, and in that way I rambled in Dandaka forest besotted with blood-drinking while
reaching Rama. 
"While I was wandering in Dandaka forest as an abuser of virtue, then I reached Rama
who by then has assumed the rectitude befitting to a saint, and I even reached the great-fortunate
Vaidehi and top-speeded-chariot-rider Lakshmana. 
"I was in the shape of an animal with incisive horns. Such as I was I recollected my
earlier grudge against that great mighty Rama who takes delight in the welfare of all being, who by
then was santlike on a regulated diet and abiding in the forest, whereby I presumed him to be mere
hermit. In that way, I was very extremely infuriated to recollect his earlier assault on me, and I
indiscriminately dashed towards him, only to kill him, completely disregarding his other faculties.

"Stringing out his highly magnificent bow Rama then released three excruciating and
enemy eliminating arrows which in their egress match the Air-god and the Divine-Eagle Garuda.

"All those three thunderbolt like arrows that have only blood for their board,
acutely bent at barbs, and that are highly horrendous have come at us in a coordinated manner.

"As I have earlier seen the fear caused by his arrow I am in the know of Rama's
valour, hence I retreated from there trickily and gingerly, but the other two demons were killed.

"When I was somehow exempted by the arrow of Rama I regained lifespan, and when that
arrow made me to renounce everything like a monk and fled me to this place, the other side of ocean
to where you came by your aircraft, here I am living here in a yogic way, self-collectedly like an
ascetic. 
"From then on wards, I am indeed descrying Rama at this tree and at that tree,
dressed in jute-cloths and black deerskin, and handling his bow like the Terminator handling a
tether. 
"Given to fright I even visualise thousands Rama-s, and whole this forest is
reflecting to me as one entity of Rama. 
"Even at a place void of people I am envisaging Rama alone, and oh, king of demons,
even if he enters my dream, in fact, I am jolting up and swooning. 
"Oh, Ravana, appalled of Rama the names starting with the syllable 'ra' likeratna-s,ratha-s, viz., gemstones, chariots are appalling to me, including your name, that starts
with a 'ra....' 
"I am well-acquainted with his efficacy, and a war with him will be an unfair thing
for you, for that Raghu's descendant can in fact kill either Emperor Bali or Namuchi, the demon.

"You may either wage a war with Rama if you wish to avenge the killings of Khara and
others, or forgive and forget that Rama agreeing to my suggestions, but do not broach the topic of
Rama with me if you wish to see me alive. 
"In the world many of the sagacious and reasonable people that are the practisers of
righteousness are utterly ruined along with their kith and kin, just by the misdeeds of others.

"Such a saintly one as I am, I am bound to ruin by other's misdeeds, hence you do
whatever that is fair to you, but I am not the one to simply take after you. 
"Definitely Rama is the one with exceptional resplendence, exemplary courage and
extraordinary power, and for sure, he becomes an eradicator of the world of demons. 
"If Khara positioned in Janasthaana has firstly overstepped his bounds and attacked
Rama, that too owing to Shuurpanakha, and if Rama of uncomplicated actions has eliminated Khara in
self-defence, what really is the transgression of Rama in that matter, you tell of that in the
final analysis. 
"I am saying this word of advise as I am ambitious of the wellbeing of my kinsmen
through you, and if this is disagreeable to you, you will have to deliver up your life in a
confrontation with Rama along with the lives of your kinsmen, perishing at the linearly
accelerating arrows of Rama. Maareecha though curtly said in that way, then afraid of the king of night-walkers
he became self-pitying, and said to Ravana, 'let us go.' 
"If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to only
kill me happens to see me again, deem my life is verily lost, without his shooting any arrow.

"None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn't it. What is
appearing before you is the reflected image of mine, as I am already slain by the wand of Yama, the
Terminator, the moment I conceded to your demand.
"When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh,
night-walker, thither I go, may good betide you." So said Maareecha to Ravana. 
By that word of Maareecha demon Ravana is very much gladdened and he spoke this
sentence tightly hugging him. 
"This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of my
dictate, and though you were a different night-walker earlier, henceforth you are really the good
old Maareecha. 
"Then you promptly emplane this sky-flying chariot which is yoked with ghost-faced
mules and adorned with gems along with me. 
"On deluding Vaidehi it is apt of you to go as you please, and I will bring that
Seetha of Mithila, however defiant it might be." Thus Ravana said to Maareecha. 
Tataka's son Maareecha said "All right" to Ravana, and then both Ravana and
Maareecha mounted the chariot as they would emplane an aircraft and swiftly journeyed from the
surroundings of Maareecha's hermitage. 
While looking at the seaports and forests, also at all the mountains and rivers,
even at the cities and provinces en route they proceeded. 
On reaching Dandaka forest along with Maareecha the king of demons Ravana has then
seen the hermitage of Raghava. 
Alighting the chariot that is decorated with golden ornaments Ravana then spoke this
sentence to Maareecha taking his hand into his. 
"This one which we are seeing and which is surrounded with banana plants is the
threshold of Rama's hermitage, and -`----oh, friend, the purpose for which we came here let it be
effectuated promptly." Thus Ravana hastened Maareecha. 
"And on hearing Ravana's words demon Maareecha then became a deer and indeed ambled
freely in the frontage of Rama's hermitage. 
Adopting the form of a gorgeous deer which is superbly amazing just by its
appearance, whose tips of antlers are in the hue of best sapphires, and whose face is whitish at
some places and not so whitish at other in its look, he became a Golden Deer and moved thereabout.

One of its cheeks in the shade of a reddish-lotus while the other in the hue of a
bluish-lotus, one of its ears is in the hue of bloomed blue-lotus while the other is in the shade
of a sapphire, while the shine of its stomach is like that of a best blue-diamond,
Indra-niila-maNi, and with a little upraised neck that deer has moved about there. 
One flank is shining whitish like Madhuka flowers and the other is similar to the
roseate fibrils of lotuses, while its hooves are similar to the gemstone lapis, calves thin, and
thus with very well cohered limbs that deer moved about there. 
With an upraised tail that shone forth in a tinge equal to the weapon of Indra,
namely Rainbow, and with a complexion that is lustrous and dappled with many diverse gemlike
dapples, that deer moved thereabout with a heart-stealing aura. 
Thus that demon Maareecha emerged like a highly splendorous and fascinating deer in
a wink highly irradiating those woodlands, and the threshold of Rama's hermitage in particular.

Adopting such an exquisite and heart-stealing form which is amazingly dappled with
the colours of diverse ores, that demon ambled all over there freely with the bearing of a real
deer in order that Vaidehi might be deluded, and he moved forward onto the pastures. 
And with hundreds of silvery stipples of body he became an astonishing deer with
pleasant looks and indeed moved chewing new grass-blades of trees. 
That Golden Deer has gone into the boscages of banana plants, and moved here and
there around Karnikara trees, and then resorted to a place which is within the eyeshot of Seetha.

With an odd lotus like hind-side that astounding deer is verily scintillating, and
it milled around the surroundings in the threshold of Rama's hermitage according to its own
delight. 
That excellent deer beats a retreat and again returns, and meanders thus time and
again, and turns its tail for sometime only to return once again very playfully. 
Again gambolling everywhere it sits somewhere on the ground, then, on coming to the
threshold of hermitage it goes towards herds of deer. 
That demon who has gone into the deer-hood has gone after some herd of deer. But he
returned again though that herd followed him wanting to fraternise, in order that he shall remain
perceptible to Seetha, and he whirligiged in amusing circles while leaping and bounding to and from
that herd of deer. 
All the other animals moving in that forest on seeing this demon-deer with their
necks up have come close to it, and on smelling it well they are running away to all the ten
directions noticing it as a demon turned into a deer. 
Even that demon in the deer's semblance Maareecha, though indulged in killing those
forest animals, and though the other animals are touching him, he is not killing and eating them
indulgently, only for the reason of camouflaging his present nature of demon-hood. 
What is more, Vaidehi with her felicitous eyes came towards trees yearning for
plucking the flowers in the same instant. 
And she with her inebriating glances and delightful visage moved there about while
plucking flowers of Karnikaara, Ashoka, and of Mango trees. 
That select lady who is unmeet for forest life beheld that deer which is completely
gemlike and whose limbs are surprising as though studded with pearls and gems. 
And she that Seetha goggled the Golden Deer with a wide-eyed astonishment, which
deer has pretty lips and teeth, hair resembling silver and copper ores, and she indeed gazed at it
with an affinity for wildlife. 
On seeing Rama's wife Seetha that highly phantasmal deer too then moved there about
as though to scintillate that woodland. 
To see such a deer which is hitherto unseen, and which is as though studded with
numerous gems, the daughter of Janaka, Seetha, went in to an intense wonderment. On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, Maareecha, a
well-informed one and an articulator spoke to the lord of demons in reply. 
"It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is
impossible to get them who talk judgementally and give suggestions that may be apparently insipid,
but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises. 
"Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept,
for you are impetuous and desultory in dealing with your spies, but that Rama is identical to the
thunderous Mahendra and tempestuous Varuna, the Rain-god. 
"Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Rama
will render this world de-demonised! 
"Has this Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, taken birth to end your life, or what! And
because of this Seetha will there be a great disaster, so to speak! 
"Egocentric and rampant, such as you are, on acquiring you as her lord, will the
City of Lanka be doomed along with her demons, and you put together, or what! 
"Any king of your like who is with a self-will, ill-will, ensorcelled by evil, and
malicious in intent, that king alone ruins his own city-state, his own people, even himself, as a
matter of actual fact. 
"Rama the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's happiness is completely forsaken by his
father - no, he is not; there is unseemliness in him - no, not in the least; he is out of character
- no; he is selfish - no; he is an ignoble Kshatriya - no, not at all; and he is neither a debased
one insofar as the merits of righteousness are concerned, nor he is atrocious towards living
beings, for he takes delight in the welfare of all beings. 
"On seeing his father who is a proponent of truth, and whom Kaikeyi has outwitted,
that virtue-souled Rama neatly decamped from Ayodhya saying that 'I will prove my father to be a
real proponent of truth.' 
"Discarding the kingdom and even royal-comforts Rama entered Dandaka forest only to
fulfil the cherish of Kaikeyi, viz., kingdom for her son Bharata, and even that of Dasharatha,
viz., to remain loyal to his promise to Kaikeyi. 
"Rama is ruthless - no; an unscholarly one - no; unconquered are his senses - no;
and oh, boy, it is unapt of you to speak of impalpable and unheard-of topics in this way.

"Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, he is an equable person with truthfulness
as his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the king of entire world. 
"Rama's proper resplendence is protecting Vaidehi. How then you really wish to
forcibly rob her off from Rama, as though wishing to rob the Sun of his resplendence. 
"Arrows as it jets of fire, bow and sword as it firewood that fire called Rama will
be blazing in war, and it will be inapt of you to enter into such an uninfringeable fire,
recklessly. 
"With the bow stretched to his ear becoming a gaping mouth spouting flames, arrows
becoming tongues of fire spewed forth from that flaming mouth, he that Rama the reified Terminator
will become fierce and insufferable when he wields bow and arrows, and oh, dear boy Ravana, it will
be inapt of you to at once draw pretty nigh of such an annihilator of the armies of enemies, on
discarding your kingdom, comforts and even the dear life of yours. 
"Which Rama's wife is Janaka's daughter that Rama is indeed with an inestimable
resplendence, and it will be incapable of you to steal Seetha while such a Rama's bow safeguards
her in the forest, besides the firewall called his resplendence. 
"That lady Seetha is his wife, dearest than the lives of that lion-chested lion-man
Rama, and in truth, she is avowed to follow him alone, in perpetuity. 
"As the spire of blazing ritual fire cannot be abused, so also, she that curvaceous
Maithili, the cherished wife of that dynamic Rama, is an impossibility for any abuse. 
"Oh, king of demons, What is the result in making such a futile effort? If that Rama
glances at you in a given war that alone ends your life. 
"If you cherish to take pleasure for a long time in your life, in your comforts and
also thus in your kingdom, which kingdom is highly impossible to achieve, do not do anything
unpleasant to Rama. 
"Such as you are, you should firstly deliberate with all of your ministers that have
a righteous bearing, duly keeping your brother Vibheeshana at the helm of affairs, and then you
take a decision on your own considering rights and wrongs of the case, and bearing in mind about
your own strengths and weakness, and even on making sure of Raghava's capability in its reality,
and then it will be apt of you to take up befitting action that will be conducive to your
interests. 
"Oh, king of nightwalkers Ravana, I for myself deem that your confrontation with
Rama, the prince of Kosala, in a war is improper, and a better, befitting, and a reasonable one is
this advise of mine, to which you may listen further. "At one time even I was on the rove around this earth, taking pride in my valour,
bearing the strength of a thousand elephants, mountainous in my size and black-cloudlike in my
sheen, wearing ear-knobs and a crown made out of refined gold, with a bludgeon as my weapon, and
such as I was, I rambled Dandaka forest causing terror to the world, and eating the fleshes of
sages." Thus Maareecha started to narrate his experience with Rama. 
"The virtue-souled great-saint Vishvamitra who was highly scared of me, then on
going to Dasharatha in person that great-saint spoke this to that lord of people. 
" 'An awesome dismay has befallen owing to this Maareecha, oh, lord of people
Dasharatha, let Rama safeguard me becoming alert at the opportune time of the Vedic-ritual.

"When he is spoken in that way, then that virtue-souled king Dasharatha replied that
great-fortunate and great-saint Vishvamitra in this way. 
" 'This boy Rama is less than twelve years in his age, unproficient in the use of
weapons, and if need be, whatever army of mine is there it will march on along with me instead of
Rama. 
" 'And having come in person with fourfold forces, oh eminent sage, I myself will
eradicate that nightwalker whomever you indicate as an enemy of yours." So said Dasharatga to
Vishvamitra. 
"When the sage Vishvamitra is spoken thus, then he said to the king, 'No other force
in the world than Rama can counterbalance that demon. 
" 'No doubt, you are a defender of gods in wars, and oh, king, the exploits you have
undertaken on behalf of gods are well-known in the triad of worlds. 
" 'Maybe your army is a remarkable one, oh, enemy-inflamer, let it sit tight here
alone, and even if this great resplendent one is still a boy he alone is competent to forestall
that Maareecha, hence oh, enemy-subjugator, let good betide you, I wish to take him alone along
with me.' 
"Thus that way on saying he that sage Vishvamitra returned to his own hermitage
highly gladdening to take the prince Rama along with him. 
"Then in Dandaka forest Rama twingeing his amazing bow stayed nearby the sage
Vishvamitra who entered the vow of Vedic-ritual. 
"At that time, yet unborn are the identities of adulthood like moustache on his
face, and that providential one was magnificent in looks with a peacock-blue complexion, wearing a
single cloth, locks of hair, and golden locket, and wielding a bow, and he was irradiating the
Dandaka forest with a radiating radiance of his own, and then he appeared like the just risen
baby-moon. 
"And I who was like a massive black-cloud, wearing golden ear-knobs, already a
forceful one further reinforced with the boon of Brahma, I pridefully entered into the interior of
Vishwamitra's hermitage. 
"Rama quickly noticed me on my very entry with an uplifted weapon, and on seeing me
he unexcitedly strung bowstring to his bow. 
"Unmindfully trivialising him as, 'this Raghava is just a boy,' I made haste and ran
towards that Fire-altar of Vishvamitra. 
"He then released an acute arrow that eliminates the enemy, and hit by it I am
plunged into the ocean which was a hundred yojana-s off. 
"That Rama did not wish to kill me then, and I am thus saved by that valiant one,
oh, dear boy Ravana, but the thrust of Rama's arrow bewildered my animation and I was on my last
legs. 
"That way I who had been flung into the abyssal water of the ocean by him gained
consciousness after a long time and proceeded towards the city of Lanka. 
"At that time, that one with elementary knowledge in the use of weaponry, but who
can undertake deeds in an effortless manner, such a boy, such a Rama spared me, albeit killing them
that were my helpmates in that escapade. 
"Thereby, if you wish to make for any confrontation with Rama, despite of my
proscribing you, you will ruin yourself on getting a disastrous calamity. 
"The demons are methodical in sporting and flirting, thus by their own conduct they
are also socialising and frolicking, and to them you derive distress and disaster. 
"Dense with skyscrapers and palaces, and decorated with many a gemstone is that city
Lanka, but you will see it completely shattered down, for the sake of that Maithili. 
"Even if with uncommitted sins, the sinless will get ruined owing to their
interdependence with other sinners, like the fish in a lake with snakes. 
"Bedaubed with divine sandal-paste, beautified with divine ornaments are the limbs
of the demons now, perchance you will be seeing them trampled out on ground for the blunder of
yours. 
"Maybe, you will have to see the fleeing of the nightwalkers surviving after the
carnage in all ten directions, some abandoning their wives and some along with their wives, only
for lack of a protector. 
"Without a doubt you will be seeing Lanka encircled with an enmesh of arrows,
enfolded in the tongues of torches, while her buildings are utterly gutting down. 
"Oh, king, there is no other sin that is outrageous and gravest than the dalliance
with another's wife and, besides, you already have a thousand wives, isn't so! 
"Abide by your own wife and be delighted with her, oh, demon, safeguard your own
ethnos, thus safeguard dignity, affluence, and kingdom of demons, thereby safeguard even your own
dear life. 
"If you desire to take pleasure with your beautiful wives and with your friend's
circles for a long time, do not do anything undesirable to Rama. 
"If you wish to intimidate Seetha aggressively despite of my considerable preventing
in all my good-heartedness towards you, then your army will fade away, and you with your kinsfolk
will emigrate to the world of Yama, the Terminator, for your life will be taken away by the arrow
of Rama." Thus, Maareecha spoke to Ravana. While those consorts were weeping on that occasion, Mandodari, the senior most and
beloved wife of Ravana, who was feeling miserable, stared at her husband.
Gazing at Ravana, her husband who was killed by Rama of unimaginable exploits,
Mandodari there, miserably lamented (as follows):
"O the great armed, the brother of Kubera! Even Indra the destroyer of strongholds,
indeed dares not to stand before you, when you were enraged."
"Because of fear from you, eminent sages, illustrious Gandharvas the celestial
musicians and the wandering bards indeed fled in all directions."
"O the lord of demons! O king! How is it that you are not ashamed, though you were
conquered in battle, by Rama, a mere mortal?"
"How did a mortal, wandering in a forest, killed you, who having overcome the three
worlds by dint of your prowess, had grown irresistible and were endowed with glory?"
"It is not possible of annihilation of yourself, who lived in a place not accessible
to men and was able to assume any form at your will, by Rama in battle."
"I do not believe this act of Rama in the battle-front, nor do I believe of the
attack by him, on your army, fully equipped with all the implements of war."
"The moment your brother Khara was killed by Rama in Janasthana, though surrounded
by a multitude of demons, it became evident that Rama was really no mortal."
"We felt painful, the moment Hanuma penetrated, by dint of his prowess, deep into
the City of Lanka, which was difficult to be entered even for gods."
"The day when the terrific monkeys built a bridge on the great ocean, that day
itself I believed that Rama was not an ordinary mortal."
"Otherwise, for your destruction, Yama, the lord of Death came himself assuming the
form of Rama having arranged an unimaginable form of illusion."
"O the mighty lord! Otherwise, you might have been overpowered by Indra the lord of
celestials. But for Indra, where is the capacity even to behold you in battle?
"This Rama is certainly a great ascetic, an eternal person, having no beginning
middle or end, greater than distinguished universal spirit like Brahma, the one beyond ignorance,
the nourisher, wielding a conch, a disc and a mace, wearing the 'Srivatsa' mark on his chest, of
lasting beauty, incapable of being conquered, a perpetual one, being the constant soul of the
universe, truly mighty, the lord of all the worlds, the prosperous one having a great splendour and
Vishnu, the lord of maintenance of the world with a wish to benefit the worlds, assuming a human
form surrounded by all the gods in the form of monkeys, Rama killed you, surrounded by demons.
"In the past, by performing a great penance, you conquered the senses and conquered
the three worlds. Now, as if revenging that enmity, those very senses conquered you."
"The moment your brother Khara was killed by Rama in Janasthana, though surrounded
by a multitude of demons, it became evident that Rama was really no mortal. We felt perturbed, the
moment Hanuma penetrated, by dint of his prowess, deeply into the City of Lanka, which was
difficult to be entered even for gods."
"This evil result has come upon you, since you did not heed to my advice, saying
that no hostility should be entered into with Rama."
"O the foremost of demons! For the annihilation of your power, your body and your
own people, you conceived a desire for Seetha suddenly."
"O the foolish one! An unworthy act was indeed done by you, in offending Seetha, who
was more distinguished and more respectable than Arundhati (wife of sage Vasishta) and Rohini (the
principal spouse of moon-god)."
"O my lord, who annihilated yourself and your people! Seetha is the model of
forbearance even to the Goddess Earth and a model of grace to Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune and
charm. She is extremely fond of her husband. By a recourse to a fraud in bringing that Seetha in a
lonely forest, faultless in every limb as she was, and charming though miserable, and having failed
to fulfill your desire for union with Seetha and due to your own fault you have been surely
consumed by the asceticism of that woman, devoted as she was to her husband."
"It is because, the gods together with Indra the ruler of gods including those
headed by the fire-god fear you, that you were not consumed even while you were laying hands on
Seetha, the slender-waisted woman."
"There is no doubt that when the time comes, the doer surely reaps a harsh fruit of
his sinful deed."
"The doer of an auspicious act obtains happiness, while the doer of a sinful act
reaps misery. While Vibhishana has obtained happiness, you met with such an evil destiny."
"There are other women, more excellent in form than Seetha for you in your
gynaecium. Having fallen a prey to the power of passion, you did not know it through
ignorance."
"Seetha is no match for me either in birth or in beauty or in amiability. You did
not perceive this through infatuation."
"At any time, there is no causeless death for any living being. As for you, this
Seetha has become a cause."
"Death which was brought about on account of Seetha was invited by you from a
far-off distance. Free from sorrow, Seetha will now be enjoying herself with Rama."
"I, however, whose stock of merit was deficient, have fallen into a terrific ocean
of grief. I, who having enjoyed myself with you in suitable aerial cars in Mount Kailasa, mount
Mandara, Mount Meru and in a grove named Chaitraratha and in all celestial gardens, decked as was
with lovely garlands and clad in colorful robes and invested in matchless splendour, visiting and
seeing various lands of every description have now been deprived of all sense- enjoyments because
of your death. Though the same, I stand transformed into another as it were. Woe be to the
flickering fortunes of kings!"
"Alas, O king! That face of yours which was so tender, O lord, and distinguished by
charming eye-brows, a gloss surface, having an exceptionally prominent nose, coppery lips and
brilliant ear-rings, which vied with the moon the lotus and the sun in loveliness, light and
luster, was illumined by a number of diadems, which shone with its eyes wild and rolling through
inebriety in banqueting places, bore garlands of various kinds, was lovely and charming in every
way, was lit with a captivating smile and indulged in a delightful talk - that face of yours does
not actually shine as before today pierced with Rama's arrows, it lies dyed with streams of blood.
It has its marrow shattered and has got soiled through the dust raised by the chariots."
"Alas! The last stage of my life, which conferred widow ship on me, has come and
which was never contemplated me at any time; a stupid woman as I am."
"I was very much proud that my father was king of demons, my husband a lord of
demons and my son, a conqueror of Indra the lord of celestials."
"I had a firm conviction that my guardians were capable of crushing their arrogant
adversaries, heroes as they were, renowned for their might and valour, and as such had no fear from
any quarter."
"How did this unknown danger come from a mortal to you, who were so powerful?"
"O king! The body of yours which was really dark as glossy sapphire, gigantic like a
lofty mountain and resplendent with Keyuras and Angadas (two varieties of armlets) and necklace of
cat's eye-gems and pearls and wreaths of flowers, which body looked more charming during your
pleasure-walks and dazzling in battle-fields, which shone with luster of jewels as a rainy cloud
with flashes of lightning lies transfixed in numerous sharp arrows today. Though it will be
difficult for me to touch it again, it is no longer possible to embrace it. It has tendons cut to
pieces, by arrows of Rama, dug deep into your vital parts and closely transfixed like the spines of
a porcupine. Though dark of complexion, it is now transformed into the colour of blood and lies
fallen on the ground like a mountain broken into pieces when hit by a stroke of thunder-bolt."
"Alas! Is it a dream? Is it the reality? But, how could you be killed by Rama? You
were the death, even to Death himself. How did you depart from this world, falling under the sway
of Death?
"My husband enjoyed the wealth of all the three worlds. He gave tremendous fear to
the three worlds. He conquered the guardians of the worlds and lifted up Lord Shiva (along with his
seat, Mount Kailasa)."
"My husband held down those who were arrogant. He manifested his prowess and shook
up the worlds. He caused the living beings to weep, with his roars."
"He used to utter arrogant words with vigour in the presence of his enemies. He was
the protector for his troop and his servants. He was the killer of those who indulged in terrible
acts."
"He was the killer of the lords of demons and Yakshas the super natural beings in
thousands. He was drawing to himself, the demons called Nivatakavachas, in battles."
"My husband ruined several sacrificial performances. He was the protector of his own
people. He violated the moral order. He violated the moral order. He created conjuring tricks on
the battle-field."
"He used to bring the virgin-daughters of gods, demons and human beings from here
and there. He brought mourning to his enemy's wives. He was the leader of his own people."
"He was the protector of the island of Lanka. He was the doer of terrible deeds. He
was the bestower of desires and sensual gratifications to us. He was excellent among the
chariot-warriors."
"Seeing my husband with such power struck down by Rama, I, having my husband killed,
am hard-hearted indeed, still bearing this body."
"Having reposed on very valuable coaches, O the king of demons, why are you lying
buried in sleep slumber on the bare ground and shrouded in dust?"
"When Indrajit, your son was killed in battle by Lakshmana, I was hard-hit then and
today, of course, I am completely beaten down."
"Bereft of kinsfolk and forsaken by you, my lord, and deprived of desires and
sensual enjoyments, I shall lament for ever more years."
"O king! Having embarked today on a long journey, which is very difficult to be
traversed, take me too with you, tormented as I am with grief. I shall not survive without
you."
"Why do you intend to go, leaving me here, miserable as I am? Why do you not speak
to me, a sad and lamenting creature, and unfortunate as I am?"
"O Lord! Are you not indeed enraged, in seeing me on foot in this way out through
the city-gate, unveiled and come on foot in the way?
"O lover of your consorts! Look at all your spouses, who came out, with their veils
dropped off. Why are you not getting enraged in seeing this?"
"This Mandodari, who was helping in your sport with you, is weeping with
helplessness. You are not consoling her. Do you not have a high esteem of her?"
"You have fallen under the sway of your enemies in that you were cursed by the
numerous women of noble lineage, who, though devoted to their husband, fond of piety and intent on
the service of their elders, had been widowed by you, O king, and were accordingly tormented with
grief. That curse which was pronounced at that time by those aggrieved women on their having been
wronged by you, has fallen on you."
"The popular saying that the tears of virtuous wives d not generally fall on the
ground in vain' has come out probably true in your case O king!"
"How was this mean act of abducting a lady, done by you, who having invaded the
three worlds, were proud f your prowess?"
"It was indeed a mark of your cowardice that Rama's consort was borne away by you,
after luring away Rama from his hermitage in the pretext of deer"
"I do not recall your faint-heartedness at any time on the battle-field. That case
of abduction of Seetha, however, was due to your ill-luck and certainly as the result of your
sins."
"O the mighty armed one! Whatever my younger brother-in-law, Vibhishana who knows
matters relating to the pat and of the future and also conversant with the present said after
reflecting and sighing for long, on seeing Seetha abducted by you: 'The destruction of the chiefs
among the demons now is imminent, have become true words. This misfortune had come from the lust,
wrath and addiction to the vice of deep attachment."
"This major disaster occurred, destroying our very root, because of you. This entire
race of demons has been deprived of its protector, by you."
"You, who were far illustrious for your strength and prowess, do not deserve to be
lamented for by me. But, because of feminine nature, my mind is leaning towards melancholy."
"By taking away your merit and sin, you obtained your course of fate. I, however,
mourn for my own self, so afflicted as I am, by your death."
"O Ravana! You did not hear the advice of your friends, who wish for your welfare.
Nor did you hear the words of your brothers completely."
"The counsel offered by Vibhishana, which was endowed with reason, meaning, rule of
conduct, wholesome, gentle and well-founded, was not implemented by you."
"The advices offered by Mareecha, Kumbhakarna, myself and my father have not been
heeded by you, who were arrogant of your prowess. What is followed is a bitter consequence of your
perversity."
"My lord, resembling a dark cloud in hue, clad in yellow and decked with brilliant
armlets, why are you lying with your limbs, cast away on the ground and bathed in blood?"
"As though fast asleep, why are you not replying to me, the granddaughter of Somali
the demon who was clever, endowed with extraordinary prowess and never retreated in battles,
tormented with grief as I am?"
"Arise, arise! Why are you lying down, though subjected to a fresh insult? The sun's
rays have penetrated deep into Lanka today, without any fear."
"Torn into thousand pieces, that iron bludgeon of yours, which was brilliant as the
sun, like a thunderbolt of Indra, with which you killed your enemies in the battle-field, which was
constantly honoured by you, which had struck many in battle and which was decked with gold, lies
scattered."
Why are you lying down, embracing the battle-ground, as one would embrace a loved
one? Why do you not feel inclined to reply to me, as though I were abhorrent to you?"
"Woe be to me, that my heart is not bursting into pieces, tormented as I am with
grief, now that you have returned to the five elements."
Lamenting thus, with her eyes filled with tears and her heart moistened with love,
Mandodari, at that time, fell into a swoon.
Fallen on the breast of Ravana, that dispirited Mandodari, stricken as she was with
grief, shone like a vivid flash of lightning across a rainy cloud, reddened by the flow of
twilight.
Raising up Mandodari, who was in that condition bitterly weeping, her co-wives who
were also weeping, very much distressed as they were, began to console her (as follows):
"Don't you know the uncertain state of the worlds, O queen, that the wealth of kings
is unsteady, when there is a change in the tide of their fate?"
While they were consoling thus, Mandodari, moistening her breasts and her spotless
face in tears, wept aloud at that moment.
In the meanwhile, Rama spoke to Vibhishana as follows: "Let the obsequies of your
brother be performed and let these crews of women be consoled."
Reflecting with his intellect, the intelligent Vibhishana, the knower of virtue,
thereupon, spoke to Rama, the following words, which were in conformity with righteousness and
self-interest.
"I am not obliged to perform the obsequies to him, who had abandoned the vow of
virtue, who was cruel, who killed human beings, who was a cheater and who had longed for others'
wives."
"This Ravana, who was interested in wishing evil to all, though venerable as a
respectable elder, is not fit for honour. He is my enemy, in the guise of a brother."
"If I do not perform obsequies, O Rama, the human beings on earth will speak about
me as ruthless. But, on hearing about his bad qualities all of them will speak of it as a good
act."
Hearing those words, Rama the best among the supporters of virtue and skilled in
speech, was very much pleased and spoke the following words to Vibhishana, the intelligent one in
his speech.
"O king of demons! I too have to do a favour to you. I won the battle because of
you. Certainly I have to give you an appropriate advice."
"This demon may be full of unrighteousness and falsehood. But, he was brilliant,
strong and ever a brave warrior in battles."
"It is heard that Ravana who was mighty, endowed with strength and who was causing
people to cry, was not conquered by the chiefs like Indra and others."
"Hostilities end with death. Our purpose has been accomplished. Let his funeral
rites be performed. He is even as good mine also, as yours."
"According to rule, Ravana is eligible to get the last rites on his dead body from
you, by usage. You will also become fit for glory."
Having heard the words of Rama, Vibhishana in haste began to do obsequies to Ravana,
his dead brother.
Entering the City of Lanka, that Vibhishana, the lord of demons, quickly concluded
the Agnihotra (the act of pouring oblations into the sacred fire) carried on by Ravana.
Vibhishana actually caused to be brought together, carts, excellent varieties of
firewood, the three sacred fires and the priests required to officiate at the obsequies, logs of
sandalwood, various types of firewood, pieces of fragrant aloe-wood, odorous perfumes, as well as
gems, pearls and corals.
Surrounded with demons, he came back for a while and thereupon, Vibhishana along
with malyavan (the father of his own mother) initiated the obsequies.
Placing Ravana, the lord of demons, who was covered with linen, accompanied by
blasts of various musical instruments as well as panegyrists singing his the Brahmanas (forming
part of the demon's race, which was apparently divided into four classes, like human beings) stood
around him with their faces filled in tears. Lifting up that palanquin, which had been decorated
with colorful flags and flowers and taking up blocks of wood, all the demons for their part, with
Vibhishana in front, proceeded with their face turned towards the south.
Those sacrificial fires were ignited and re-animated, as they were, by Adhvaryu
priests, the performers of the sacrificial act, at that time. Those sacrificial fires were
contained in earthen pots and went in front of Ravana's body.
All those women of the gynaecium, while weeping, followed at his heels with quick
paces, stumbling, as they were, on all sides.
Keeping the body of Ravana on a consecrated spot, Vibhishana and others, who were
very much afflicted with grief, piled up a sacred pyre, with logs of sandalwood, moistened with
perfumes called Padmaka and Koshira and covered with the skin of black antelopes, turned about to
perform the obsequies in accordance with Vedic rites in honour of the king.
They performed the ancestral oblations to Ravana in a superb way. They constructed
an altar in the south-east the funeral pile) and placed the sacred fire in its proper place.
They poured a ladle-full of ghee mixed with curds on his shoulders, placed a cart at
his feet and then a wooden mortar at his thighs.
Having set at their proper place, all the wooden vessels (used in Agnihotra), the
lower piece of wood used for kindling fire at a sacrifice and the upper piece of wood (which is
rotated at great speed on to lower one, to produce fire by friction), the wooden pestle and other
things used in the sacrifice, they circled around the funeral pyre.
According to ordinance laid down by eminent sages and according to the rules viewed
in Vedas, having sacrificed a goat fit for sacrifice at that spot, the demons dampened with ghee on
Ravana the King of demons.
Having decorated the body of Ravana with perfumes, garlands and various kinds of
clothes; those demons accompanied by Vibhishana, distressed as they were in their minds, poured
parched grains of rice, with their faces bathed in tears.
That Vibhishana set fire to Ravana, according to the rules in the scriptures.
Washing himself and offering in his wet clothes, according to scriptural ordinance, sesame seeds
mixed with water, as well as blades of Kusha grass and offering obeisance to Ravana by bowing his
head, Vibhishana entreated those women to return, consoling them again and again. Then, all of the
returned to the City.
When those women were re-entering the City, Vibhishana the lord of demons on
approaching Rama's vicinity then remained standing there with humility.
Having destroyed the enemy, Rama too experienced happiness, along with his army as
well as with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, even as Indra the wielder of thunderbolt did on destroying
Vritra the demon.
Thereupon, taking off his bow and arrows as also that great armour endowed to him by
Indra, Rama the annihilator of his enemies, taking off his anger too, because of the enemy's
defeat, then obtained a charming benevolence.Perceiving Ravana enraged, a very strong demon named Mahaparsva thought for a while
and with joined palms, spoke as follows:
"That man indeed is a fool, who after reaching a forest inhabited by wild beasts and
vicious elephants and having duly found honey, does not drink it."
"O,annihilator of enemies! Who is a lord to you, who are a lord of all? Setting your
foot upon the heads of your enemies, take pleasure with Sita."
"O, ruler endowed with a mighty prowess! Act in the mode of a cock, forcibly against
her. Enjoy that Sita, by charging on her again and again and revel with her."
"What fear will be there to you, after fulfilling your lust? All that comes or yet
to come will be prevented (by us)."
"Kumbhakarna and Indrajit of great might together with us are capable of keeping off
even Devendra (god of celestials), wielding the weapon of a thunderbolt."
"Overstepping the methods of giving away gifts or conciliation or even showing
dissention being followed by right men, I like accomplishment of actions through hostile
means."
"O, ruler endowed with great might! We shall make all your enemies reaching here to
surrender, by the power of our weapons. There is no doubt about it."
Appreciating the words spoken thus by Mahaparsva, King Ravana spoke the following
words:
"O, Mahaparsva! Know a little secret about me. I shall tell you an incident, which
occurred to me long ago."
"Once I saw a celestial nymph, Punjikasthala(by name) flashing like a flame,
concealing herself in the sky and proceeding towards the abode of Brahma."
"She was made unclothed by me and was enjoyed forcibly. Thereafter, appearing like a
crumpled lotus, she went to the abode of Brahma."
"I think that the matter was made known to the high soled Brahama and then the
enraged Brahma spoke to me the following words:
"From today onwards, if you revel with any other woman forcibly, your head then
undoubtedly will break asunder into a hundred pieces."
"Fearing the curse given in this manner by Brahama, I am not violently making Sita
the daughter of Videha, to mount on my beautiful bed forcibly."
"My swiftness is like that of an ocean. My movement is like that of a wind. Rama
does not know this and hence he is indeed having an encounter with me."
"If not otherwise, who wants to arouse me (for a combat) as one would awaken a lion
asleep, sitting at a place in a mountain cave or arouse into activity an enraged Death?"
"Rama did not see the arrows, looking like two tongued serpents, coming forth from
me. That is why he is marching against me for a battle"
"I shall blaze up Rama swiftly with my arrows in hundreds resembling thunder bolts
discharged from my bow, like tormenting an elephant with fire brands."
"Surrounded by great army, I shall take away that strength of Rama, as a rising sun
at dawn takes away radiance of the stars."
"Even Devendra (lord of celestials) with thousand eyes or Varuna (king of the
Universe) can not conquer me in battle. Once upon a time, this city of Lanka ruled by Kubera (Lord
of riches) was conquered by me with the power of my arms.On seeing Markaraksha come out, all those chiefs of monkeys, leaping all at once,
took their positions, with intent to give fight.
Thereafter, a very great battle ensued between monkeys and demons, which caused
one's hair to bristle, like the encounter between celestials and demons.
The monkeys and demons then, by hurling trees and spikes and by throwing maces and
clubs, began to crush each other.
Those demons, who were prowlers of might, made a slaughter of the lions among the
monkeys, by means of their javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, sharp edged spears, Bhindipalas
(slings for throwing stones), nooses, mallets, staffs, missiles and other weapons and by throwing
arrows on all sides.
Tormented by Makaraksha with a multitude of arrows, all the monkeys were bewildered
in mind, agonized with fear and ran away.
On seeing those monkeys fleeing, all the arrogant demons roared like lions, assuming
a triumphant feeling.
While those monkeys were fleeing on all sides, Rama then, with a shower of arrows,
intercepted those demons on that occasion.
Seeing Rama thus interrupting the demons, Makaraksha, the demon, engrossed in a fire
of anger, spoke the following words:
"Pause, O Rama! You will have a dual with me. I will make your life to quit, by the
sharp arrows discharged from my bow."
"Since you killed my father on that day in Dandaka forest, my anger is still growing
violent, when I think of you engaged in such nefarious acts".
"O evil minded Rama! Since you were not being seen by me from that time in that
large forest, my limbs were getting very much fumed."
"By a good fortune, you came into my sight here, O Rama! You are being sought by me,
as a lion in hunger seeks other animal to eat."
"Now, by the flight of my arrows, you will go to the world of Death and reside there
with those warriors, who were killed by you earlier."
"O Rama! What is the use, by telling too much on this topic? Hear my words. All the
worlds will look at you and me, in this battle-front."
"O Rama! The battle will proceed in the battle-field, either with the weapons, or
with a mace or by our arms or by any other means as learnt by you."
Hearing the words of Makaraksha, Rama the son of Dasaratha laughingly spoke the
following words to him, who was still talking further and further (without interruption).
"O demon! Why are you boasting yourself with so many unworthy words, in vain?
Without fighting in the battle-field, it is well nigh impossible for you to attain victory with the
strength of a mere speech."
"I killed fourteen thousand demons along with Khara your father, Trishira and even
Dushana in Dandaka forest."
"O sinful one! Today, vultures jackals and crows with their sharp beaks and
goad-like claws will be satiated with your flesh."
Hearing Rama's words, the mighty Makaraksha discharged a multitude of arrows on that
Rama in the battle-field.
Rama tore those arrows in many ways, by his array of arrows. Those arrows, which
were provided with golden shafts, fell to the ground, when torn in thousands.
That battle raged furiously, on their meeting each other there, between Makaraksha
the son of Khara the demon and Rama the son of Dasaratha.
Then, the sound emanated by the bows, with a great resonance, was heard on the
battle-front, like the rumbling of clouds in space.
With an intent to see that wonderful battle, all the celestials, the demons, the
celestial musicians kinnaras the mythical beings and Mahoragas the great serpents reached the
sky.
Though the limbs of both were pierced by each other, their strength was redoubled.
The two warriors inflicted wounds on each other, returned the blows of the other in the
battle-front and continued the combat.
In the battle, that demon broke the multitude of arrows discharged by Rama. Rama
snapped off, in many ways, the arrows released by the demon.
All the four quarters and the intermediate points were diffused with a multitude of
arrows. Even the earth was covered on all sides and did not become visible.
Then, the long-armed Rama, full of anger in battle, broke off the bow of the demon.
Thereupon, by his eight iron arrows, struck the charioteer.
Rama, breaking the chariot with his arrows and killing its horses, made them to fall
down dead. That Makaraksha the demon, bereft of his chariot, stood on the ground.
That demon, standing on the ground, took into his hand, a spike, which created
fright among all living beings and whose splendour was equal to the fire at the end of the
world.
That great spike, which was difficult to be obtained, was gifted to him by Rudra,
one of the eight forms of Shiva the Lord of Dissolution. That terrible spike, which flamed
violently in the sky, looked like another new weapon of destruction of the world. On seeing it, all
the godheads were afflicted with fear and fled to different quarters.
Brandishing that flaming great spike, that enraged demon hurled it against that
great-souled rama.
Rama broke, by his four arrows, that flaming spike coming forth from Makaraksha's
arm and rushing towards him in the sky.
That spike, adored with charming gold, broken in many ways, struck by Rama's arrows,
fell scattered on the earth, like a mighty meteor.
Seeing that spike struck by Rama, who was unwearied in action, the beings standing
in the air, cried, saying 'Excellent, Excellent!'.
Seeing that spike destroyed, Makaraksha the demon, rising his fist, called out to
Rama, saying "Wait, Wait!".
Then, seeing Makaraksha rushing towards him, that Rama the delight of Raghu dynasty,
while smiling, fitted to his bow, a mystic missile presided over by fire.
Struck by that missile by Rama, the demon with his heart split open, fell down dead
then and there, in the battle-field.
Seeing the fall of Makaraksha, all those demons, tormented by the fear of Rama's
arrows, ran away straight to Lanka.
Thrilled with delight, the celestials watched that demon, the son of Khara,
destroyed by the flights of Rama's arrows and resembling a mountain shattered, after struck by
lightning.Manthara with her wicked thoughts tries to convince Kaikeyi of the possible misfortune that could occur to Kaikeyi and her family if Sri Rama becomes the King. Although Kaikeyi's initial reaction is to praise Rama's qualities; her mind is slowly but surely poisoned by Manathara's sinful words.
Manthara, becoming indignant with Kaikeyi, threw down the ornament given to her and with anger and distress spoke the following words: "O, foolish one! Not knowing that you are in the midst of an ocean of trouble, what is it that you are so delighted about, in a matter to be grieved?"
"Oh, queen! Though stricken with grief, I mentally laugh at you in that you are
rejoicing at the time when a great calamity is befalling you."
"I am lamenting over your foolish mind. Does any intelligent woman feel happy over the prosperity of a stepson who is considered an enemy? Does it not amount to praising a befalling death?"
"Rama has a fear about Bharata because Bharata has equal rights over the kingdom. In thinking about this matter, I am getting anguished. Do we not get disasters from those who are afraid of us?"
"Lakshmana, wielding a great bow, joined Rama with all his heart. Shatrughna is as faithful to Bharata as Lakshmana to Rama".
"Oh Kaikeyi! In line with even the proximity of birth; the claim to the throne of
Bharata alone can be pressed, that of Lakshmana and Satrughna who are younger is out of question."
"Rama is a learned man and a political statesman. His actions are timely and
appropriate. When thinking of your son's calamity to be resulted from Rama, I get shaken with fear".
"Kausalya is very fortunate. Brahmans are going to anoint her son for the great
princely kingdom tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star".
"With folded arms, as a maid-servant, you have to serve that Kausalya who having
reached great prosperity, in the height of joy, will dispose of her adversaries (in the person of Bharata and yourself)".
"Thus, if you become Kausalya's servant-maid along with us, your son Bharata will be Rama's attendant."
"Rama's wives will get delighted. Your daughters-in-law will be unhappy because of Bharata's waning position."
Hearing Manthara speak thus in many distasteful words, Kaikeyi began to extol Rama's virtues, saying: - "Rama knows all righteousness. Elders trained him. He has a proper gratitude. He speaks truth. He has a clean conduct. He is the eldest son of king Dasaratha and hence eligible for the kingdom."
"The long living Rama will protect his brothers and servants like a father. O, the hunch backed one! Why are you so pained on hearing about Rama's coronation?"
"After Rama's rule for one hundred years, Bharata the best among men will certainly replace Rama on his father's throne, which is that of his ancestors."
"Oh, Manthara! When we got an occasion for rejoicing as at present and when a
festive occasion is to come off in future (too in the form of Bharata's installation, no matter even if it comes after a hundred years), why do you feel agonized like this as though burning (with jealousy)?"
"For me, Rama is as lovable as Bharata and even more. Is he not doing more service to me than to Kausalya?"
"If Rama has kingdom then Bharata has it as well. Rama esteems his brothers just as his own self."
Manthara, after hearing Kaikeyi's words, felt very sad and after a long and hot
sigh, spoke to her the following words: "On one side, you are getting immersed in an ocean of sorrow filled with misery and danger. But due to stupidity, you are not able to perceive the truth and you fail to assess your real position."
"O,Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes the king, his son will become the king after him in
succession. Thus, Bharata's name itself will be removed from the royal clan."
"O, Kaikeyi! All the sons of a king will not be crowned for a kingdom. If all are
installed, there will be a great lawlessness."
"Therefore, kings, O, Kaikeyi of faultless limbs, install their eldest son,
eventhough others may be full of virtues, as their successor to the throne."
"Oh, Kaikeyi the affectionate one! Your son will be completely distant from comforts and even from the royal clan; like an orphan."
"I came here in your interests. But you have not understood me. You think it fit to give me a present when your step-wife is getting prospered."
"Rama, ascending the throne without hindrance, will either send away Bharata to some other country or have him put to death. This is certain."
"You sent Bharata to his maternal uncle's house even in his childhood. By being
nearer, love is born even on inanimate objects. By sending Bharata to a distant place, you made Dasaratha to have no affection towards him."
"Shatrughna was drawn towards Bharata and went along with him. Just as Lakshmana
joined Rama, Shatrughna joined Bharata."
"We hear that a tree marked down for felling by foresters, when covered by thorny
Ishhiika grass, is saved from this great danger of cutting. So also, Dasaratha might have supported Bharata if he was staying near to him in Ayodhya."
"Lakshmana protects Rama. Rama protects Lakshmana. Their brotherly love is as famous as that of Aswini celestials."
"Hence, Rama will not do a sinful act of killing Lakshmana. However there is no
doubt that he will do so in the case of Bharata."
"Hence, I feel that it is better for your son to go to forest directly from his
uncle's house. This is good for you too."
"If Bharata gets his father's kingdom as per law, it will be beneficial to you and your side of relatives."
"Your youthful son, habituated to comforts, is a natural enemy to Rama. How can
Bharata who failed to achieve his purpose live under control of Rama; whose flourishing object has been realised?"
"Rama is chasing and bringing down Bharata as a lion chases an elephant-king in
forest. You ought to protect Bharata."
"Previously, you treated Kausalya with disrespect due to arrogance that you were
fortunate. Will not such Kausalya, your rival wife, revenge for that animosity?"
"O, Kaikeyi! The day Rama becomes lord of this earth with its great oceans,
mountains and towns; that day you and your Bharata will get a bad and pitiable position of ignominy."
"When Rama gets power of the kingdom Bharata will certainly get ruined. Hence, think of a solution to get your son Bharata the kingdom and to send Rama, your enemy, to exile."After hearing those words, Kaikeyi with her face burning with anger, had a long and hot sigh and spoke to Manthara as follows:
"Now itself, I shall send Rama quickly to forest. I shall get Bharata anointed for princely kingdom immediately."
"O Manthara! What is the means by which Bharata will get the kingdom but Rama will not get it by any method. Think about it now."
After hearing her words, the sinful thinking Manthara, spoke thus to Kaikeyi to
destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom.
"O Kaikeyi! I am very glad. I shall tell you the means by which your son Bharata
only will get the kingdom. Listen to it!"
"Oh, Kaikeyi! You desire to hear from me the means for your benefit. Have you
forgotten about it or are you hiding, even if you have remembered it?"
"O the lady of charms, Kaikeyi! If you desire to hear this from my mouth, I shall
tell you. Listen to me. Let it be acted upon after listening to me."
After hearing Manthara's words, Kaikeyi slightly rose from the well-laid bed and
spoke the following : "O Manthara! Tell me the trick by which Bharata will get the kingdom and Rama will not get it under any circumstances."
After hearing Kaikeyi's words, the sinful thinking, hunch backed Manthara, spoke
thus, with an intention to destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom.
"O Queen! Once upon a time, when there was a battle between celestials and demons, your husband Dasaratha went along with you and other holy kings to help Indra in battle, to a famous city called Vaijayata in which the demon Timidhvaja lived in a southern direction in the forest of Dandaka."
"That great demon famously called shambara, who had several magic effects, defeated all the celestials and conferred battle upon Devendra."
"In that great battle, demons approached and forcefully killed men who were injured by arrows and also those who were sleeping at night."
"Then, king Dasaratha fought a great battle there. With their weapons, demons made into pieces the long armed Dasaratha."
"O Queen! You saved the life of your unconscious husband by taking him away from the battle field. There also, you again saved him, when beaten by demons with their weapons."
"O Kaikeyi with auspicious appearance! Getting delighted, he gave two boons to you. Then, you said, " I shall ask you whenever I require them". He then agreed to it."
"O Queen! I do not know what had happened there. You yourself told this story
previously to me. I am keeping this in my mind because of my friendship with you. Hence, you have to stop, by force, the arrangements being made for Rama's coronation."
"You ask your husband as two boons, anointing Bharata for princely kingdom and
sending Rama to exile for fourteen years."
If you send Rama to forest for fourteen years, your son Bharata will get intimate
association in the hearts of the people and will get stabilised in kingdom.
Oh, kaikeyi! Now, enter the room of wrath as if angry with him and lie down on floor without any spread underneath and wearing soiled clothes.
As soon as you see Dasaratha, be sorrowful and keep on weeping, without looking at him and without talking to him face to face.
You are always dear to your husband. I have no doubt about it. King Dasaratha will even jump into a fire for your sake.
The king is not capable of making you angry. He is not even able to see you with
anger. He will give up his life for your love.
Oh, foolish one! The king will not be able to transgress your word. You realise your abundant strength.
King Dasaratha may offer you diamonds, pearls, gold and various other precious
stones. Do not care for them.
Oh, Kaikeyi, the great fortunate! you remind Dasaratha of those boons given by him to you in that battle between celestials and demons. See that your benefit does not get thwarted.
Dasaratha himself will raise you from the floor and offer you the boon. Thus , after making him steady, you ask for this boon.
"Oh, king! send Rama to forest for fourteen years. Let Bharata be made as king of
this earth".
Rama having been sent to forest for fourteen years, your son will stand firmly,
having laid his roots and will stay in power for the remaining period.
Oh, Kaikeyi! Ask Dasaratha of sending Rama to forest also as a boon. Thus, your son will accomplish all the desired benefits.
Thus , by sending Rama to exile, he will not become amiable to people. Your Bharata will become king, after the enemies having been annihilated.
When Rama returns from forest, your wise son will accumulate friends and draw people to his fold, thus establishing roots himself.
This is the appropriate time for you. Be fearless and by your insistence, make the king turn aside his effort to anoint Rama.
Kaikeyi, being brain-washed an unworthy matter as the most worthy matter by
Manthara, accepted her well and having delighted, spoke to her as follows:-
Though of right thinking in nature, Kaikeyi was very much surprised to hear
Manthara's words and like a small girl, got into a wrong path.
Oh, Manthara! You are telling very good things. Till now, I have not recognised you as this good. You are the best among the hunch-backed on this earth in making intellectual decisions.
Oh, Manthara! you always show interest in my well being and wish for my benefit. But for you, I would not have been aware of the king's intentions.
There are so many hunch backed persons in the world. Their bodily construction is
very bad. They are crooked and dreadful. But you appear lovely, as a lotus flower bent by breeze.
Your chest is appearing equally on both sides and is loftily extended unto the
shoulder. Below it is the stomach with an excellent navel, which is lean as though it is shy of seeing the loftiness of chest.
Oh, Manthara! with perfect hips and well rounded breasts and with your face like an untainted moon you are shining well.
Oh, Manthara! your waist decorated with golden belt is making sound. Your
leg-muscles are well rounded and your feet are tall.
Oh, Manthara! you are splendid like a royal swan walking before me, with long thighs are wearing a silk sari.
In addition to all those thousand magic effects lying in shambara, the lord of
demons, another further thousands of magic effects are lying in you.
In your long hunch, which looks like an apex of a chariot, are dwelling your various thoughts, royal arts and magic effects.
Oh Manthara! When Rama goes to forest and Bharata gets kingdom, I shall adore this hunch back with a golden garland.
Oh, Manthara! After accomplishing the benefit desired by me, I shall, with delight, get your hunch back anointed with well refined gold of good quality.
Oh, Manthara! I shall get beautiful ornaments made and for your forehead auspicious dots of variety done of pure gold.
You will be moving around like an angel, wearing beautiful clothes. You will achieve an important position in the eyes of your adversaries with pride and with your face, incomparably competing with moon.
The hunch backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service, at your feet, as how as hunch-backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service at your feet, as how as hunch-backed you are doing it to me.
Manthara in this way being praised spoke these words to Kaikeyi, who was lying in a clean couch like a flame of fire upon the sacrificial altar.
Oh, Kaikeyi the auspicious one! When water has already flown out, there is no use
constructing a dam. Now rise and do this purposeful action. Show your influence to the king.
By surrendering to the words of Manthara and having been thus encouraged by her,
Kaikeyi who was of wide eyes, who was proud of her intoxicating beauty, who was a gifted woman and a queen, removed pearl necklace worth in lacs and other great valuable auspicious ornaments from her body, entered the chamber of wrath along with Manthara, lied on the floor there like a golden wire and spoke to Manthara as follows: "After Rama's going to the forest, Bharata shall get the kingdom. Or else, you inform the king that I died here itself".
Neither gold nor diamonds nor ornaments are of any use to me. on which day Rama gets anointed for the kingdom, the same day it will be the end of my life.
Afterwards, that Manthara again spoke to the seriously talking mother of Bharata
that is Kaikeyi the following words which were beneficial to her and not beneficial in relation to Rama.
If Rama becomes king, you and your son will be destroyed. Oh, Kaikeyi of auspicious qualities! Hence you try for coronation of your son, Bharata
Having thus hit by arrows of words employed by Manthara again and again, Kaikeyi
felt sad, was angry with the king, by keeping hands on her heart, was surprised with the cleverness of Manthara and praised her time and again.
If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses or
garlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the loaf here.
If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses or
garlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the life here.
Kaikeyi, thus uttering cruel words, having removed all ornaments, lied on the floor without a mattress like a fallen angel.
Kaikeyi, having removed all adornments, having her face covered by the darkness of extreme anger and with her depressed mind, looked like a starless sky in a gloomy night.Then the eminent-saint Vishvamitra together with Vashishta said these words to Janaka, the valiant king of Videha, who has 
just said about his lineage. 
The Ikshvaku-s and Videha-s are unimaginably admirable and immeasurably distinguished dynasties, oh, Janaka, the best one 
among all men, there is no single king comparable to one from these dynasties... 
Oh, king Janaka, these espousals of Seetha with Rama and Urmila with Lakshmana is behovely to each other's dynastical prestige 
and even it is befitting to the winsome charms of the brides and bridegrooms, but that being so... 
Oh, grand sire, you may listen to my words of advise... this younger brother of yours, king Kushadhvaja, is at home in 
every kind of probity... 
Oh, king, the pair of daughters of this right-minded Kushadhvaja is nonpareil in comeliness in this world, hence, oh, grand 
sire, we choose to pair them off with Bharata and Shatrughna... 
Oh, king, for the sake of those two honourable boys, for that young man Bharata and for that smart man Shatrughna, we opt 
your brother's daughters... 
All these four sons of Dasharatha have handsomeness and youthfulness, and they are equal to the four rulers of the world 
from four quarters, and their valour vies with the valour of God Vishnu... 
"Oh, best king, let both these dynasties of yours, the impeccable dynasty of Ikshvaku-s and the immaculate dynasty of yours 
as well, be interlocked by these wedlock-s..." Thus Vishvamitra advised Janaka. 
On hearing the words of Vishvamitra that have the concurrence of Vashishta then Janaka reverently said this to those two 
eminent-saints. 
By which reason you two eminent-saints personally bid fair to this befitting proposal, thereby I opine that my dynasty 
is highly honoured... 
So be it! Safe betides you all! Let the pair of Kushdhvaja's daughters, namely Maandavi, Shrutakiirti, devout themselves 
as a pair of wives to the paired brothers, namely Bharata and Shatrughna, respectively... 
Oh, eminent-saint Vishvamitra, let the palms of four princesses be taken in the palms of these four mettlesome princes 
in marriage, in the light of one day... 
"Oh, Brahman, the savants acclaim that part of the day as the best for wedding ceremonies when both of the pre-Phalguni 
and post-Phalguni stars are available, and on such a time where post-Phalguni is ruling, for which Bhaga is the presiding 
deity for progeny..." So said Janaka to the marriage party. 
On saying those gracious words thus, king Janaka got up from his throne and coming nigh of both of the eminent-saints, Vishvamitra 
and Vashishta, reverently said this sentence. 
You two, oh, eminent-saints, have done an excellent generous act in my respect, thus I will ever remain your proselyte... 
you may please preside over these thrones, that of mine, my brother's, and that of Dasharatha... 
"As to how this city Mithila appertains to Dasharatha, in the same way city of Ayodhya is mine... and there shall be no 
hesitancy for you two sages in governance on these three kingdoms, thus it will be apt of you to make the marriages happen 
as aptly as you can..." So said Janaka to the sages. 
The legatee of Raghu-s king Dasharatha is gladdened while the legatee of Videha is talking in such a hobnobbing way, and 
he replied king Janaka in this way. 
Oh, kings of Mithila, Janaka and Kushadhvaja, you two brothers have reverenced inestimable sages and coteries of kings, 
as such inestimable good manners are treasured in both of you... 
"Enjoy that blessedness! Let safe betide you! We now depart to our visitatorial-palace, and we shall customarily carry out 
the tributary rituals..." Dasharatha said thus. 
On seeking leave of absence from the sovereign of people, Janaka, that highly renowned king Dasharatha promptly departed 
from there, keeping both of the eminent-saints afore, namely Vishvamitra and Vashishta. 
King Dasharatha on going to his visitatorial-palace has procedurally undertaken the tributary rituals, and on getting up 
in the next morning, he carried out the initiatory rituals of marriages, in a grand way, in which donation of cows is a 
part. 
That lord of people king Dasharatha has righteously donated hundred thousand cows to Brahman-s, in the name of each of his 
four sons. 
In that cow donation ceremony intended for his sons, he that best one among men and the one who is affectionate towards 
his sons, Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, has donated on behalf of each of his sons, four hundred thousand cows, that 
are abundant milkers, and that have golden casings on their horns, and that are with their calves, and along with milking 
jugs made with bell metal, and he even donated very many other kinds of assets to Brahmans. 
On performing the cow donations andsamaavartana, snaataka, the initiatory ceremonies of his 
sons, as well, he that serene king Dasharatha who is amidst the quartet of his sons, shone forth like serene Brahma, who 
is quartet-faced, with the quartet of Veda-s, and who is the overlord of mankind, amidst the quartet of presiding deities 
in the quartet of the world. 
When the great-souled Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva in this way, Sugreeva spoke this
word to Hanuma who is available at his side. 
"Convoke the Vaanara-s available on the summits of these five mountains, namely Mt.
Mahendra, Mt. Himalaya, Mt. Vindhya, and Mt. Kailash and those that are on the whitish peak of Mt.
Mandara. As well as those that are on the mountains at the seashore,udaya
adri, namely 'sunrise-mountain,' which mountains will always be dazzling with the tinge of
youthful sun. And them that are on the mountains which shine in the ochry hue of evening clouds,asta adri, namely 'sunset-mountain' and which mountains are situated
at the Palace of Sun. And the catastrophic monkey chiefs that are abiding in the palm groves of Mt.
Padma. Also thus, the fly-jumpers who are similar to black mascara and black clouds in their shine,
and who match elephants in their vigour, and who live on Mt. Anjana, they too are to be convened.
Those fly-jumpers whose complexion will be golden and dwell in the caves of Great-Mountain, besides
those who are on the mountainsides of Mt. Meru, and those biding on the Black-Red mountain, along
with those topmost speeded fly-jumpers living on Mt. Great-Ochre swilling palm-toddy, these are to
be summoned. Further, the vanara-s who will be in the tinge of the rising sun and who dwell in the
highly delightful, richly fragrant and lofty woodlands that are surrounded by the delightful
hermitages of sages are to be summoned. Along with them, the vanara-s who are in the interiors of
forests, are also to be called for. Why cite a few? Those and those monkeys that are on the
earth, all of them are to be assembled. Oh, Hanuma, you quickly summon all of the topmost speeded
vanara-s by employing concessions, conciliations and the like procedures. [--, , , , , ,
, ]
"In the first instance, highly speedy vanara-s are hastened at my command, however,
you hasten some more monkey chiefs to hasten them. 
"Those that are entangled with creature comforts, and those that are stringy
dawdlers, you quickly lead all of those monkey chiefs in here. 
"And such of those vanara-s that do not arrive within ten days by my command, those
miscreants are eliminable as the abusers of the king's decree. 
"Let all the lively monkeys available on earth that abide by my control start coming
to this place in hundreds, thousands, even in millions, by my command. 
"The champions of monkeys with ghastly aspects and similar in shine with the
mountains and clouds shall start coming here by my command, fly-jumping as though to overcast the
sky. 
"Let those vanara-s who know the routes to the dwelling places of other monkeys
expeditiously proceed on quick routes, and gather all of the monkeys available on earth at my
command," Sugreeva ordered Hanuma that way. 
On hearing the order of Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, Hanuma, the son of Air-god
has started to dispatch valorous monkeys in all directions. 
In a split-second, the vanara-s that are sent by the king of vanara-s have
skyrocketed to the airways of birds and stars on their way, and indeed reached the vault of heaven,
which was once trodden by Vishnu. 
After skyrocketing those monkeys have reached the monkeys that are living at
seashores and islands, in the caves and crags of mountains, and at lakeshores and their surrounds,
and motivated all of the monkeys available there towards the cause of Rama. 
On hearing that command of the king of kings of Vanara-s, Sugreeva, who is semblable
with the Death-god and Time-god, all of the monkeys have arrived with the terror of Sugreeva
haunting them. 
Then thirty million fly-jumpers whose swiftness is inconceivable, and whose shine is
like that of black mascara have sallied forth from mountain Anjana to there where Raghava is
camping, i.e., Mt. Prasravana. 
A hundred million monkeys take delight in the best mountain where the sun goes
into dusk, namely the westerly mountains,asta adri, and whose hue is
similar to the refined gold, for dusk has a golden hue, have jumped in. 
Vanara-s who are in the hue of lion's mane have turned up in thousand crores, say
hundred billion, from the pinnacles of Mt. Kailash. 
Those who are sheltered in the Himalayas subsisting on fruits and tubers have arrived
in a thousand of thousand crores, say a trillion. 
Millions and millions of Vanara-s whose looks and deeds are gruesome, and who equal
the planet Mars in their crimson flush, as it dwells on the hotbeds of Mt. Vindhya, has swiftly
alighted from Mt. Vindhya. 
The count of those vanara-s who are domiciled at the coasts of the Milky
ocean, the residents of Tamala woodlands, and those who feed on coconuts dwelling in coconut
groves, and who have presently come from those places is uncountable. 
That highly forceful military force of vanara-s has arrived from forests, caverns
and riversides with their leaping and bounding on the sky blocking up the sun as if they have
gulped him down. 
The Vanara-s who went from Kishkindha to hasten up all the other monkeys of all
quarters, those champions have reached the Himalayan Mountains and saw exceptional trees on them.

On that best and auspicious mountain, once a glorious Vedic-ritual intending God
Shiva took place, which pleased the hearts of all gods. 
There the vanara-s have seen luscious tubers and fruits similar to nectar, which
have originated from the oblational food material spattered in the Vedic ritual for Shiva.

If one eats for one time, a little of those divine and heart-pleasing fruits and
tubers that have taken their origin from that oblational food material, he remains satiated for a
month. 
The best monkeys that are fruit-eaters have collected those divine fruits, tubers,
and even the divine medicinal herbs. 
On going to the cardinal ground of Vedic ritual which was performed once, those
Canara fetched highly fragrant flowers to please Sugreeva. 
On motivating all of the monkeys on earth, all those best monkeys who proceeded to
gather other monkeys quickly returned to Kishkindha ahead of the forgathered troops of monkeys.

Those quick-paced monkeys quickly reached Kishkindha just at that moment when
Lakshmana is still with Sugreeva, and those monkeys arrived at that place where Sugreeva is
available along with Lakshmana. 
Taking the medicinal herbs, fruits, and tubers along with them, all of those
Vaanaras obliged Sugreeva to accept fruits, tubers and herbs as royal gifts, and they also spoke
this word to Sugreeva. 
"We have rounded up all the mountains, rivers, and forests even, and all of the
Vanara-s available on earth are fetched to your fore according to your command." Thus the monkeys
said to Sugreeva. 
On listening to these words then the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is gladdened and
accepted the gifts brought from the Himalayas from all of them. "Those lion-hearted fly-jumpers who are informed thus by the kingly eagle Sampaati have gladly jumped and loped 
and screamed in the league 
On hearing the words of Sampaati, the monkeys have delightedly come to the ocean to go to the residence of Ravana, 
longing for a glimpse of Seetha. 
Passing across that province those superbly venturesome monkeys have seen the ocean available there, appearing 
like a great mirror image of the world in its entirety. 
On reaching the northern side of the southern ocean those best monkeys have collectively made a camp there. 
That ocean is uproarious with its tides, and with its gigantic and misshapen beings that are sporting in water 
with their wide-opened mouths.
Somewhere that ocean is as though sleeping well, and somewhere else it is as though sporting, elsewhere it is 
overspread with tidewaters as high as mountains, somewhere else it is tumultuous with the best demonic beings 
who are the residents on the plane of the netherworld, and the elephantine monkeys despaired on seeing such a hair-raising 
Ocean. 
On seeing the shoreless ocean that is like an endless sky, hence unnavigable, the vanara-s are despaired and said 
each to each, "How to vault this ocean?" 
Then the best one among monkeys, Angada, started to inspirit the army of monkeys who were anguished by fear on 
their gazing at the ocean. 
"Losing heart to dismay is an unworkability, because dismaying itself is detrimental, and dismay alone ruins 
a person, as a vicious viper unworkably ruins an innocent child... 
"Individual achievement will be unachievable to him who readily braces himself with despair when the time for 
venturesomeness verges on, because of the lack of his vitality..." So said Angada and then the nightfall 
occurred. 
While that night is elapsing into the wee hours of the next day, Angada meets all the golden-ager monkeys, again 
deliberated with them. 
When those troops of the monkey army stood encircling Angada, it beamed forth like the army of gods encircling Indra. 

Who can capably consolidate that army of monkeys, other than Vali's son Angada, or, other than Hanuma? None. Because 
that army itself is an army of fickle, tickly monkeys. 
Then that enemy-subjugator and illustrious Angada, on revering the old-ager monkeys and paying due respects to 
the army of monkeys spoke this meaningful sentence. 
"Now, who is that great-resplendent one who can vault over the ocean and who is he who can facilitate the enemy-repressor 
Sugreeva to become truthful to his word... 
"Who is that brave hurdler who can hurdle over a hundred yojana distance, oh, fly-jumpers, who is he who can even 
emancipate all these monkey commanders from the great fear of Sugreeva... 
"By whose benignancy we can rejoicingly see our wives, sons, houses, and homes on going back from here after achieving 
the purpose of our task... 
"By whose benevolence we can unworriedly approach Rama, or even that irascible Lakshmana, or ruthless Sugreeva, 
as well... 
"If someone among you is competent enough to jump over the ocean, that monkey may now quickly give us all, a munificence, 
called a solemn impunity from Sugreeva..." Angada addressed monkeys in this way. 
On hearing Angada's words there is no someone to say something in that matter, as the entire monkey troop is 
as though dumbfounded. 
Again that best one among monkeys Angada clearly said to those monkeys thus, "All of you are the best ones among 
powerful monkeys, you all are determinedly venturesome, born in flawless families and even adored again and again 
for your adventures... 
"There will be no barrier to whomsoever, whensoever he wanted essay wheresoever, isn't it! Hence, oh, best fly-jumpers, 
each one you may give an account as to which one has got which capability in jump-leaping the ocean. 
On hearing the polite and righteous words of Hanuma, which are just yeomanly towards Hanuma's lord, namely Sugreeva, 
Angada said these sentences. 
"Un-deducible in Sugreeva are his steadiness, or harmlessness, or frankness, also thus salience, or even valiance, 
furthermore cleanliness of heart or soul. 
"Which Sugreeva has arrogated his elder brother's wife when that elder brother is still alive and well, where 
she is morally his motherlike, an empress and a lady love of that elder brother, thus he is despicable, and which 
Sugreeva closed the mouth of the cavity when his brother in all his belief assigned and stationed him alone at 
the mouth of the cavity to fight the demon Dundubhi if he tries to escape, all the more when his brother 
is still inside the cavity, thus he is nefarious, how then he can be said as one conversant with moral rectitude? 

"Which Sugreeva has overlooked no less than the great glorious Raghava, whom he truthfully befriended and from 
whom his task of arrogating my kingdom by eliminating my father is facilitated, how then can he remember the 
good services of others like us? 
"He has ordered and sent us to search Seetha owing to the fear from Lakshmana, but not as a coward fearing 
his unscrupulousness, how then can scrupulosity be manifest in him? 
"Who is that respectable one who can put belief in Sugreeva, while that Sugreeva is shameful by his shameless 
act of eliminating my father, and unmindful of tradition in usurping my mother and throne, and unthankful in requiting 
Rama by himself, instead of using us as pawns, and changeful in ignoring his promise to Rama, but in fearing for 
Lakshmana? Will it be possible, especially for one like me to belong to his family? 
"Whether a son is honest or dishonest he alone is investable in the kingdom. How then can Sugreeva let me, the 
one from the family of his enemy, live on? 
"My slyness in planning to live in Black Hole has backfired, I am now culpable in not finding Seetha the 
troop leader, and I am powerless as you all are on Sugreeva's side, how then can I live on indeed after reaching 
Kishkindha, like a caitiff, turned into a wretch. 
"Indeed he surceases me by some mysterious trammeling punishment, for that Sugreeva becomes disingenuous, ferocious, 
also barbarous just for the reason of his kingship. 
"Fast unto death behooves me than trammels and tramples, thus you all be acquiescent to my proposal and you may 
go back to your dwellings. 
"I am reiterating to you all that I do not wish to go to the city of Kishkindha, and here only I sit fasting unto 
death, as death alone is expedient to me. 
"On my behalf, Raghava-s wellbeing may be enquired about firstly paying deference to them, so also the wellbeing of my 
paternal uncle and king may be enquired, only after paying deference to that lord of vanara-s. 
"My stepmother Ruma may be asked after regarding her healthiness. And it will be apt of you to solace my mother 
Lady Tara, who by her nature is a warm-hearted and austerely lady who cherishes her son more, and such as she 
is she will leave off her life on hearing that I breathed my last." So said Angada to all monkeys. [--b, 
a]
On speaking to that point and after paying deference to older vanara-s available there, Angada puling glum-facedly 
reclined on the sacred grass spread on the ground. 
Apropos to Angada's recumbency on the ground, the other outstanding Vanara-s snivellingly sluiced down seethingly 
effusive teardrops emotionally. 
While disesteeming Sugreeva but esteeming Vali, all of the vanara-s have gathered around Angada deciding to sit 
down for fasting unto death in step with Angada. 
Those best ones among fly-jumpers on discerning the words of Angada, the son of Vali, and agreeing to what all 
said by Angada as appropriate, they positioned themselves on the sacred grass after touching the waters sacramentally. 
The sacred grass is spread as sacred beds to cast off their lives. The edges of the grass blades are positioned southward. 
As they are on that northern shore of the southern ocean, all those best monkeys who are bent on self-immolation, 
became recumbent facing eastward. 
An unknown apprehensive dread came upon those monkeys when they discussed Rama's living in forests, Dasharatha's 
demise, calamity caused to Janasthaana, and casualty to Jataayu, like the stealing of Vaidehi and slaying of 
Vali. 
While those many fly-jumpers who mirror up great mountaintops by their physique are recumbent discussing stridently, 
the entrails of caves of the mountain are rendered strident, and that mountain itself appeared like a skyscape filled 
with strident clouds about to burst a good fortune. "Then on hearing the words of Angada those best vanara-s, namely Gaja, Gavaaksha,
Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda and Dvivida, and Susheshana, and like that Jambavanta have
individually said about their abilities in the matter of leaping the ocean according to their turn.

In that matter Gaja said, "I can fly ten yojana-s..." and Gavaaksha said, "I can go
over twenty yojana-s..." 
In that matter, the vanara Sharabha said to the monkeys, "Oh, fly-jumpers, I can
indeed go up to thirty yojana-s..." The vanara Sharabha said, "I can go up to forty yojana-s,
undoubtedly..." The great-resplendent Gandhamaadana said, "I can go up to fifty yojana-s, no
doubt..." The vanara Mainda said the monkeys in that matter, "I venture to jump just sixty
yojana-s..." Then the great-resplendent Dvivida informed, "I can go up to seventy yojana-s, no
doubt..." But mighty Shushena, the best and the great resplendent monkey said, "I promise to jump
eighty yojana-s..." 
Jambavanta, the oldest one among all of them, appreciates those who are telling
about their jumping capacities, has informed them in this way. 
"Previously there was some traversal daredevilry even for us, such as we were, we
are presently on the other shore of our age... 
"That being so, for which purpose the king of monkeys Sugreeva and even Rama are
decisively decided on this task, it is impossible for us to marginalize this task... 
"While we say you may hear what cruise we have at this age... we can go up to ninety
yojana-s, undoubtedly... 
Jambavanta further said this to all of those best monkeys, "my capability in the
stint of going was not limited only thereunto... 
"Once I have performed circumambulation around the Omnipresent and Eternal Vishnu in
His incarnation as Trivikrama, when He grandiosely increased His physique from that of a
Divine-Dwarfish Brahman boy to that of an Omnidirectional Being, thus filling the whole of the Universe
to tread all three worlds, during the time of the Vedic ritual of Emperor Bali, the legatee of
Vairocana... 
"Such as I was, I am presently old and decrepit and I have become a slow-jumping
soldier of misfortune, though my energy in youth was unmatchable and unsurpassable. 
"Now, at this age, I can go on my own only thereunto... and by
that much endeavor that task will be unaccomplished..." So said Jambavanta to monkeys.

Then on reverencing the great monkey Jambavanta, the highly intelligent Angada
thereafter said these salutary words. 
"I can vault over this ocean which is broadwise in a hundred yojana-breadth, but
whether I am capable of coming back or not, is indefinite... 
That expert in sentence making, Jambavanta said to the best one among monkeys namely
Angada, "Oh, Angada, the best one among monkeys and bears, I know about your capability in
traversal... 
"Why a hundred, if need be you are capable of going up to a hundred thousand yojana-s
and come back... but this method of our sending you is uncanonical... 
"Oh, dear Angada, in any lord assigner cannot be an assignee, hence oh, best
fly-jumper, all of these people are assignable by you... 
"You are notionally established as our lord and we have to become your
protectionists and, oh, enemy-inflamer Angada, lord becomes the protectionist of the army... this alone
is the method... 
"Oh, enemy-subjugator, really you are the linchpin to this mission, thereby oh, dear
Angada, you are always to be protected like anything that needs safeguarding... 
" 'The prime mover of a task is to be safeguarded...' is the byword of the
taskmasters, and indeed if only the prime mover is there, all the endowments are achievable that
yield fruits... 
"Thereby, oh, truth-valiant Angada, you are instrumental to this task, and as you are
privileged with sagacity and audacity, oh, enemy-inflamer, you are the keystone for this task of
searching Seetha... 
"For us, you are indeed a respectable one by yourself, and as the son of respected
Vali too, and oh, best monkey, sheltered by you we are indeed capable of achieving the objective of
our task..." So said Jambavanta to Angada. 
When that highly scholarly Jambavanta has said thus, the great monkey and the son of
Vali Angada said this sentence in reply as an answer. 
"If I am not proceeding to Lanka, nor any other monkey is proceeding, then we have
to undertake self-immolation once again, isn't it? 
"I do not perceive any secure protection for our lives on our going to Kishkindha
without fulfilling the bidding of that resolute king of monkeys Sugreeva... 
"Sugreeva is a lord who shows either forgiveness or furiousness immoderately... and
our going to Kishkindha trespassing his bidding is as good as our entering into our doom...

"It will happen in that way only as our going back to Kishkindha results in no other
way, thereby it will be apt of you to think deeply, as you can envision the implications..." Thus
Angada said to Jambavanta. 
When that best and valiant fly-jumper Jambavanta is said that way by Angada, then
Jambavanta advised him in this best sentence to Angada. 
"Oh, brave Angada, this mission of yours will not be thwarted in the least. I will
motivate him who achieve success in this mission of searching for Seetha... 
Then Jambavanta, the outstanding one among monkeys started to motivate the
exceptional fly-jumper, and a marvelous one among all the monkeys, and who by now is comfortably
sitting abiding a lonely place, namely Hanuma. 
Thereupon, the heroic monkeys like Angada and others as also Hanuma, the great one among 
the monkeys accepted the words of Jambavan.
Then, the excellent monkeys, resembling Meru and Mandara mountains, like elephants in 
rut, as if covering the sky, having huge bodies and colossal strength, keeping Hanuma in their front, 
leaving Mount Mahendra, went ahead leaping delightfully. They looked as though conducted by the mind's 
eyes of Hanuma, who is adored by living beings as having good stupendous swiftness, having resolved 
to fulfill the purpose of Rama and to attain great glory, having accomplished the purpose and duly 
determined to complete the task. All of them were looking up at narrating the previous pleasant tidings 
and taking delight in war. All of them, in high spirits, were judging rightly the vengeance of Rama 
against the evil-minded Ravana.
Then, those monkeys, leaping into the sky and floating in the air, reached a garden-looking 
like Nandanavana the divine grove filled with trees and creepers.
They reached, that Madhuvana by name, the garden abounded with honey, which was protected 
grove, unapproachable for all and looking fascinated to the soul of all beings.
A very powerful monkey called Dadhimukha, who was a high-souled eminent monkey, and the 
the maternal uncle of Sugreeva always protected that garden.
Reaching that huge grove, which was very dear to the heart of Sugreeva, those monkeys 
became highly excessive in their behavior.
Then, seeing that large Madhuvana, the garden abounded in honey, those monkeys, whose 
the color was as yellow as honey, was delighted and solicited Angada the prince for permission to taste 
the honey.
Thereupon, Angada the prince, taking approval from elders like Jambavan and others, 
gave the monkeys the liberty to drink honey there.
Thereafter, all those monkeys, thus permitted to drink honey, were exceedingly pleased. 
Then, those excited monkeys felt glad and began dancing.
Some were singing. Some were offering salutations. Some were dancing. Some were laughing 
loudly. Some were falling. Some were moving in different directions. Some were jumping up. Some 
were talking incoherently.
Some were leaning against one another. Some were falling upon one another. Some were 
disputing with one another. Some were playing with one another.
Some were running from one tree to another. Some were falling down to the ground from 
the tree-tops. Some, with a missile-like speed, were flying towards the tops of gigantic trees from 
the ground.
While one was singing, another approached him laughing. While one was laughing, another 
approached him weeping. While one was weeping, another approached him pushing. While one was pushing, 
another approached him roaring.
That army of monkeys, moving in an excessively honey-drunken state, became highly excited. 
None in that army was not drunk. None in that army was not satiated.
Seeing that the grove, was being consumed and the trees stripped of their leaves and flowers 
the monkey named Dadhimukha (who was in charge of the grove) then angrily interrupted those monkeys.
Threatened by those monkeys who were behaving excessively, Dadhimukha who was endowed 
with a terrible energy, the care-taker of the grove and an elderly hero of the monkeys further contemplated 
the means to protect that grove from the monkeys.
He spoke harsh words with some and courageously struck some others with his palms uninterruptedly, 
created a quarrel by coming into collusion with some, and approached some in a conciliatory manner.
That Dadhimukha was dragged, after coming into collusion with him by those monkeys, who 
were being forcibly hindered by him, even though those monkeys overpowered him with unrestrained emotion 
arising out of their intoxication, those who had abandoned their fear disregarding any bad consequence 
of their act.
Bruising with their nails, biting with their teeth on account of their inebriety and 
making short work of that Dadhimukha with their palms and feet, all that moneys made that large grove, 
divested of its flowers, fruits, and honey.Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.
Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
identified with the  letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
lettertaan auspicious letter.
The ascetic Valmiki inquired Naarada - 'who engaged deeply in austerity and study of Vedas, best among the eloquent and eminent among sages' (as follows:). 
"Who really is that person in this present world, who is virtuous and vigorous, a conscientious 
	one, one who is mindful of good deeds done to him, and also a speaker of truth and who is determined in his deed... 
"Who is appropriate in disposition... who is interested in welfare of all beings... who is 
	adept and also an able one... also uniquely pleasant to look at... 
"Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even
	the gods fear, when provoked to war... 
"All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, 
and indeed my inquisitiveness is immense..." Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. 
On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said "let 
it be heard..." and beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. 

"Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard." Thus Narada started to say. 
"One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, 
highly valorous, resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. 
"He is a wise one, moralist, eloquent, glorious, and a destroyer of enemies. His arms are lengthy, 
with three lines in the neck , and cheekbones high... 
"He is lion-chested, with concealed collarbones, knee-length are his arms, and his is a long bow, an enemy-subjugator, 
and his emperor's countenance is with a crowning-head and an ample forehead, and his gait is majestic like that of a lion... 

"He is built proportionately physically, with limbs poised symmetrically, sinew-chested, wide-eyed, complexioned 
charmingly... he is a prosperous one with all the auspicious features ... 

"He is the knower of rectitude, bidden by the truth, also his concern is in the welfare of subjects, 
proficient in prudence, clean in his conduct, self-controlled and an attentive one... 

"He equals Lord Vishnu, the Lord of all creatures, Sustainer of the Universe, together with Sri Lakshmi (shriimaan = lakShmiivaan), Eliminator of enemies,
 Protector of the world of living creatures and complete Guardian of probity... 

"He is the preserver of his own righteousness and also a champion for adherent's welfare in the same 
righteousness, and he is a scholar in the essence of Veda-s and their ancillaries, too. He is an expert 
indhanurVeda, the Art of Archery... 
"He is the knower of the meaning and essence of all the scriptures, excellent at memory, a brilliant one, 
and dear to all the worlds, gentle, level-headed and clear-headed in discriminating and distinguishing... 

"Like an ocean that is reached by rivers, that reverential one too is always accessible 
and reachable by clean-minded ones, and he treats all equally, and ever a feast to eye... 
"He who betters the happiness of his mother Kausalya is an embodiment of all noble merits, and in profundity 
he is like an unfathomable ocean, and by fortitude he is unalterable like the kingly Himalayan mountain... 

"In valour Rama is comparable to Vishnu, and in his looks he is attractive like the moon, he equals 
the earth in his forgiveness, but he is matchable to world ending fire in his wrath... and in benevolence 
he is identical to Kubera, God of Wealth, and in his candour he is like Dharma itself, the 
Truth personified, with none to rival him... 
"Lord of the land King Dasaratha with an intent for doing good to the people, affectionately desired to endow with regent-hood to that Rama, 
the eldest and a dear son to Dasaratha and who possessed such merits with true valour, together with best of qualities, 
and concerned for welfare of the people....
"Then seeing the arrangements for the anointment of Rama as crown-prince, Kaikeyi, the dear wife 
and a queen of Dasaratha, solicited boons that were once accorded to her by Dasharatha, for the 
banishment of Rama and anointment of Bharata as boons. 
"Bound by his true plighted word and by the noose of righteousness that king Dasharatha 
		exiled his dear son Rama to forests. 
"That warrior Rama went to forest for pleasing Kaikeyi, and as 
directed by his father, and to follow his father's word of honour. 
"While that Rama was going on exile, Lakshmana, endowed with humbleness, and augmentor of his mother Sumitra's joy, and a loving and a 
dear brother to Rama, followed him out of affection, showing brotherly fraternity.
"Even Seetha, daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, and Rama's beloved wife equalling to Rama's life, ever well disposed, born in the family of Janaka and one as though 
	fashioned by a Divine marvel, endowed with all good characteristics and the best among women, followed Rama to forest, like Rohini following the Moon... 
"The citizens of Ayodhya and his father Dasaratha followed virtuous Rama for a 
distance when he started on his exile. Later Rama reached the tribal chief named Guha, who liked 
Rama, on the bank of River Ganga in a town called Sringaberapura. Together with Guha, 
Lakshmana and Seetha, he left off the charioteer. 
"That trio of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana after going from forest to forest and crossing many a river with much waters, 
by the ordainment of Bharadwaja, arrived at Chitrakuta, and building a handsome cottage there, they lived happily and delightfully 
in the woods there, like gods and gandharvas... 
"On Rama going to Chitrakuta thus, King Dasharatha tormented by the grief for son, went to heavens 
weeping for son... 
"On Dasharatha's dying, though Bharata had been appointed for kingship by Sage Vashishta and other Brahmanas, that highly mighty one did not desire kingdom.
	That warrior Bharata went to forest to propitiate the venerable Rama... 
"That Bharata, possessed of a worthy way of thinking , on going to Rama, begged his brother Rama, a great souled one and a 
	truly courageous one. Bharata spoke words in this manner to Rama - "You alone, the knower of probity, be the king." ... ' 
"Even though Rama was very benevolent, gracious also, highly famed and with great prowess, Rama did not desire kingdom due to father's injunction... 
"Thereafter, repeatedly turning Bharata back, the elder brother, Rama, gave his wooden shoes to Bharata and entrusting them to represent him 
for the sake of kingdom. 
"That Bharata, thus with a desire unfulfilled, ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, touching Rama's sandals representing feet of Rama, with an
expectation of Rama's arrival... 
"On the departure of Bharata, that splendid Rama, truth-bound, and self-controlled, anticipated the repeated 
visits of citizens and other people. To be undisturbed, Rama then entered Dandaka forests... 
"That lotus-eyed Rama, on his entering the vast Dandaka forest, killed the demon Viraadha, and 
indeed beheld Sage Sharabhanga and also Sage Suteekhsna, Sage Agastya and likewise Sage Agastya's 
brother... 
"On Sage Agastya's word, Rama, with great delight, received from Agastya, Indra's bow along with the sword and two quivers with ever replenishing
 arrows... 
"During Rama's stay in the forest, all the sages together with other forest dwellers,
approached him for the elimination of ogres and demons... 
"He  agreed to that supplication of those sages dwelling in the forest of demons. A promise was also made by Rama to the sages who equalled 
the fire and who were living in that Dandaka forest about killing of the demons in combat... 
"While Rama was living there in the Dandaka forest, a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpa-nakha, who was 
a resident of Janasthana, a portion of Dandaka forest, was disfigured by him... 
"Then in a battle, Rama killed all demons who became zealously active incited by Suurphanakha's words, 
including the demons Khara, Trishira, Duushana together with all of their foot-followers... 
"During Rama's stay in that forest, fourteen thousand demon inhabitants of Janasthana became slain... 
"Then, on hearing the slaughter of his kinsmen, Ravana convulsed in anger and sought to get the help of a 
		demon named Maareecha... 
"But Maareecha restrained Ravana telling him many times, 'Oh, Ravana! Rivarly with that formidable 
Rama is not appropriate of you...' 
"Then disregarding Maareecha's words and impelled by his own fate, Ravana advanced to the 
place of Rama's hermitage along with Maareecha... 
"After taking away of Rama and Lakshmana to a distance by the trickster Maareecha, Ravana stole Rama's wife after killing Jatayu... 
"Raghava on seeing the smitten Jatayu and also on hearing about Seetha's abduction, wailed with disturbed senses, 
seething with anguish  ... 
"Rama then cremated that vulture Jataayu with that state of anguish, and while searching for Seetha in forest, he 
indeed saw a demon named Kabandha, deformed in his looks and with a terrible appearance... 
"That Rama with great arms after slaying Kabandha, cremated him and Kabandha obtanined heaven. Before going to heaven, he spoke thus to Rama:
'Oh Raghava! You proceed to Sabari, a lady with righteous conduct, an expert in probity and a devotee.'... 
"That great resplendent Rama, the son of Dasaratha, an anhillator of enemies, approached Sabari and was thoroughly honoured by her... 
"Rama was united indeed with the Vanara Hanuma on the banks of Lake Pampa, and upon the word of Hanuma, Rama met with 
	Sugreeva... 
"The highly powerful Rama detailed from the beginning all that happened, and in particular the abduction of Seetha, to Sugriva 
and to Hanuma also... 
"The Vanara Sugreeva after listening to all that talk of Rama made friendship with Rama delightedly with sacred fire as witness... 
"Then out of affection, the incident was related with regard to Sugreeva's enemity with Vali  
in its entirety by the Vanara King with grief to Rama ... 
"Then a solemn promise was made by Rama with regards to killing of Vali. In that regard Vanara Sugreeva also described Vali's strength... 
"But Sugreeva remained ever doubtful with respect to Raghava, about Raghava's prowess. Sugreeva showed Dundubhi's big and great mountain-like
dead body to gain confidence in Raghava... 
Great armed and very powerful Rama after seeing the bones of Dundubhi smiled and by the big toe of his foot threw it wholly for ten 
yojana-s length. 
"Then again Rama ripped through seven massive Sala trees with only one great arrow, which not only went through 
the trees but also rent through a mountain, and to the nethermost subterranean of earth, in order to 
create faith in the mind of Sugreeva... 
"Thereafter great monkey Sugreeva with a gladdened heart by that act of Rama, proceeded to cave-like Kishkindha then along with Rama 
and with confidence in Rama's strength... 

"Then that best monkey Sugreeva, with a golden hue, made a roaring sound. By that loud sound, the king of monkeys, Vali, emerged out... 

"Then after Tara  permitting, Vali met with Sugreeva in a combat. And Rama killed this Vali with a single arrow there... 
"Then Raghava after killing Vali in a combat as per Sugreeva's plea, installed Sugreeva alone as the king of Vanaras.. 
"That best among monkeys, Sugreeva, after summoning all Vanaras, dispatched them in different directions to behold the daughter of Janaka... 
"After that, the strong Hanuma, upon the word of the vulture Sampati who was elder brother of Jatayu, flew across the salty ocean
 one hundred yojanas in breadth... 
"On reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, Hanuma saw Seetha situated in Ashoka gardens there and meditating on Rama alone... 
"After delivering to Seetha the mark of identification in the form of a ring from Rama and also communicating
 Rama's disposition and consoling Vaidehi, Hanuma destroyed the welcome-arch of Ashoka gardens... 
"After killing five army chiefs and seven minister's sons and crushing the valiant Aksha, Hanuma got into state of captivity... 
"Knowing himself to be free from the captivity of the weapon according to Brahma's boon, the valiant great monkey Hanuma
enduring those demons with self-will who tied his tail with ropes with the intention of burning it, there after burning the city of Lanka while 
 leaving from fire the Seetha of Mithila, got back again to convey the pleasant news to Rama ... 
"Approaching the great Rama and peforming circumambulation around Rama, Hanuma having an inestimable intelligence,
submitted in essence thus: 'Seen Seetha...' 
"There-after, Rama along with Sugreeva and other monkeys went to the shore of Great Ocean, and put the Ocean-god to turmoil with his arrows 
comparable to the Sun... 
"The Ocean-god revealed himself and upon his word, Nala built the bridge across the ocean... 
"Rama, having gone to the city of Lanka by that bridge, killing Ravana in a battle, experienced great shame on getting Seetha back... 
"There-after, Rama spoke harshly to Seetha in the assembly of the people. Being devoted to her husband, that Seetha, intolerant of the
 harsh words of Rama, entered into burning fire... 
"Then, upon the word of Fire-god, having known Seetha to be sinless, Rama became extremely glad.
Worshipped by all gods he became resplendent. By that accomplishment of the great Raghava the three worlds together with mobile and immobile
beings, and with groups of gods and sages became exultant... 
"Enthroning Vibheeshana as the chieftain of demons in Lanka, and with a done deed, 
Rama then rejoiced highly indeed free from distress... 
"After obtaining a boon from the gods, Rama  raised up monkeys from death. He then travelled to Ayodhya by Pushpaka aircraft
surrounded by good hearted ones... 

"Rama, with true valour, on going to sage Bharadwaja's hermitage, sent Hanuma to the presence of Bharata... 
"Then, having boarded Pushpaka aircraft again after leaving the hermitage of Bharadwaja, and narrating past history
 to Sugreeva and others about the events in the days of his exile in forests, while flying overhead 
of the very same places, Rama went to Nandigrama... 
"That sinless Rama rejoining with all of his brothers in the village Nandigrama removed his matted hair. 
Thus he, on regaining Seetha and on discarding hermit's role again became 
a householder, and he regained his kingdom also... 
"When Rama is ruling the world will be highly rejoiced and happy, satisfied and abundant, 
also very righteous, wholesome, disease-free, and free from fear of famine..." Thus Narada is 
foreseeing the future and telling Valmiki. 
"While Rama is on the throne men will not see the deaths of their children anywhere in their lifetime, 
and the ladies will remain husband-devouted and unwidowed during their lifetime... 
"In the kingdom of Rama, there will be no fear for his subjects from wildfires, gale-storms or from diseases, 
and there will be no fear from hunger or thieves, nor the cattle will be drowned in floodwaters as well... 
"Cities and states as well will be replete with wealth and grains likewise. All his subjects will be highly glad always,
like in Krita yuga... 
"Like-wise the highly illustrious Rama having performed hundreds of horse rituals and having donated plentiful gold and crores
of cows and wealth that cannot be counted to Brahmanas and to scholars according to custom... 
"In this world Raghava will establish kingly dynasties in hundredfold and he will be maintaining the 
four-caste system positing each in his own duty, may it be caste-bound or provincial-kingdom-bound 
duty, in order to achieve a perfect social harmony... 
"Having served the kingdom for ten thousand years and another one thousand years, i.e. for a total 
of eleven thousand years, Rama will go to the abode of Brahma... 
"This Ramayana is holy, sin-eradicating, merit-endowing, and conformable with the teachings of Vedas.
Whoever reads this Legend of Rama, will be verily liberated of all sins... 
"This Ramayana is long-life giving. A narrative by reading which a human will be blessed with sons and grandsons, and after enjoying worldly
comforts with attendants, will be adored in heaven after demise... 

"By reading this Ramayana, that person if a Brahmana obtains excellency in speech, if a Kshatriya obtains land-lordship, if Vaisya
attains profit in trade and even if a Sudra attains excellence." Thus Sage Narada gave a gist of Ramayana 
to Sage-poet Valmiki. 
In the first chapter of Bala Kanda the gist of Ramayana is imbibed and it is calledsaMkShepa raamaayaNa,or also calledbaala raamaayaNa. The youngsters are asked to recite these stanzas daily for 
longevity and a perfect personality like that of Rama. The summarised stanzas reflected here are from 
the main epic. The canto-wise summarisation is as below:
Valmiki composed Ramayana according to the letters of Gayatri Hymn and they are identified with the 
following verses in all cantos:Hanuma on going from Mt. Rishyamuka to Mt. Malaya, has reported to the king of monkeys Sugreeva, about the two valiant Raghava-s.
"Oh! great discerner Sugreeva, this is Rama... oh, stubbornly valiant Sugreeva, this virtuously valiant Rama arrived along with his brother Lakshmana...
"Rama is the son of king Dasharatha, one born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, an adept one in virtue and thus an adherent of his father's orders...
"By whom the ritual fire is well worshipped in Vedic rituals like rajasuuya, shameth, and thus cows in hundreds and thousands are donated in those rituals, by whom this earth is ruled devoutly and truthful to his word, such Dasharatha's son is this Rama, who has to come to forests owing to a woman...
"Ravana stole the wife of this principled one and great soul Rama when dwelling in forests, such as he is, he came seeking your refuge...
"These two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, are interested to make friends with you... thus you receive these two and worship them, for they are most venerable ones..." Hanuma thus advised Sugreeva.
On hearing Hanuma's words Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys has became presentable and gladly spoke to Rama.
"You are a trained one in treading the righteous path, best by your scruples, and a kindlier one to all, so said Air-god's son Hanuma to me about your attributes, in subtlety...
"Therefore oh, lord, you wish to make friends with a monkey like me, thereby this is an honor and the best achievement to me alone...
"If you aspire my friendship here I extend my arm, take this hand of mine into yours, thus let the convention be stably made fast..." Thus Sugreeva proffered friendship to Rama.
Rama is gladdened at heart on listening to all those words well said by Sugreeva, and then clutched Sugreeva's hand in his, and ardently abiding by the vow of friendship he embraced Sugreeva, grippingly and happily.
Then the destroyer of enemies Hanuma discarding the guise of ascetic assumed his original monkey form, and on producing fire with two sticks made it glow. decorated, worshipped with flowers, then gladly and devoutly placed that fire in between Rama and Sugreeva.
Then those two performed circumambulations to that well-glowing ritual fire, and thus, Rama and Sugreeva entered into the pact of friendship.
And then gladdened at heart are those two, that monkey and Raghava, gazed enough at each other eye-to-eye, but their hearts did not derive any fraternal satisfaction.
Sugreeva rejoicingly said to Raghava, "you are an amiable friend of mine, henceforth our mirth or miseries are the same for us..."
Then Sugreeva snapped off and spread a fully flowered tree branch of a sala tree with many leaves, and sat on it along with Rama.
Then Hanuma the son of Air, gladly gave a well-flowered branch of sandalwood tree to Lakshmana...
Then that delighted Sugreeva with his sweet words, and with his eyes quavering in happiness, replied Rama softly.
"Rama, I am ridiculed, stolen is my wife, I move here about in these forests with dread and fear haunting me... I took refuge in this impenetrable forest...
"Oh, Raghava, my brother denounced me, he even made me an enemy of his, such as I am living in these forests with scare and fear, and with dismayed vitality...
"Oh, highly fortunate Rama, affirm fearlessness to me from Vali by whom I am highly intimidated, and as to how there will be fearlessness to me from him, it will be apt of you to accomplish that, that way...
When thus said, that resplendent and righteous one being the patron of virtue Rama replied Sugreeva, as though laughing off.
"A friend is the resultant factor of helpfulness... that I know... oh, great monkey I intend to eliminate that Vali, the abductor of your wife...
"Unfailing are these arrows of mine, scorchers like sun, sharp ones tied with eagle feathers, similar to Indra's Thunderbolts, sharp are their point, and straight is their egress, similar to enraged snakes, and these arrows of mine will be speeded up to fall on that vicious Vali...
"You will see now itself the falling of Vali like a splintered mountain onto the ground, when completely ruined by these cruel arrows that are similar to venomous snakes..." Thus Rama inculcated confidence in Sugreeva.
On hearing Raghava's words that are appeasing him, Sugreeva is very completely satisfied and says this fine sentence.
"By your grace, oh, lion among men, let me regain my wife and kingdom too... oh, god of humans, as to how he does not suffer me again, thus you may please make happen... let not my elder brother turned as an enemy of mine suffer me again...
During the friendly conversation of Rama and Sugreeva, the left eyes of Seetha, Vali, and Ravana bear similitude with lotuses, golden orbs, and fireballs respectively have fluttered equally.King Ravana makes enemies cry thus speaking to Seetha thereafter also ordering all ogre 
women went away.
After Ravana left and obtained gynaeceum, those ogres with horrible appearances went running to 
Seetha.
Thereafter reaching Seetha ogre women swooned with anger and with a very harsh speech spoke these 
words to Seetha.
"O Seetha! You are not respecting becoming the wife of Ravana born in the family of Paulastya, best 
among men, a great soul with ten heads."
Thereafter an ogre woman named Ekajata with red eyes due to anger calls Seetha with a stomach that 
can be held by the palm, spoke these words.
"Among the six Prajapatis, whichever son, the fourth Prajapati, born by the thought of Lord Brahma 
, he is famous as Paulastya."
By the name, famous as Visrava, with a radiance equalling that of Lord Brahma that glorious sage 
is the son born from the thought of Pulastya.
"O wide-eyed one! Ravana who makes enemies to cry, is Visrava's son. You are suited to become Ravana's 
wife. O one with all beautiful limbs! Why will you not agree words spoken by me."
Thereafter an ogre woman named Harijata with eyes like those of a cat turned around eyes due to 
anger and spoke these words.
"By whom thirty-three Devas and the king of Devas have been conquered, you are suited to become 
the wife of that lord of ogres.
Thereafter an ogre named Praghasa swooning with anger and then frightening Seetha, spoke this horrible 
word.
"Why will you not get wifehood of Ravana who is proud of his might, valiant, who will not turn 
back in wars, who are strong together with valor."
"The mighty Ravana can leave a dear respectable wife who among all wives is most fortunate and can 
obtain you."
"Ravana leaving gynaeceum filled with thousand women and shone by various best things can obtain 
you.
Another ogre woman named Vikata spoke these words: "By whom several times in war Devas, in 
war Nagas, Gandharvas, and Danavas have been conquered that Ravana has come to your side."
"O vile one! Why are you not desiring wifehood of such Ravana, fulfilled in all respects, who is 
a great soul and lord of ogres?
Thereafter an ogre woman named Durmukhi spoke these words: " O one with long eyes! Fearing whom 
the sun will not consume by heat, fearing whom the win will not blow, to that one why are you not favorable."
"O one with good eyebrows! O Seetha! By the fear of whom trees shed a shower of flowers, whenever 
Ravana desired mountains and clouds will shed water, why you are not making mind to be the wife of such Ravana, 
who is the king of ogres and king of kings."
"O Seetha with a good smile! O princess! Understand the kind words spoken to you well and truly.Then, Rama along with Sugreeva, together with the troop leaders of monkeys, ascended
the top of Suvela mountain which was having a circumference of sixteen miles.
Halting there just for a while and surveying the ten cardinal points, Rama saw the
city of Lanka, which was beautifully constructed by Visvakarma, the divine architect on the top of
Trikuta Mountain with nice arrangements and ravishing with enchanting groves.
There above a gateway, stood the invincible Ravana the lord of demons, who was being
fanned with white whisks on both sides, was graced with a triumphal parasol, was smeared with red
sandal paste, adorned with scarlet ornaments, attired in raiment embroidered in gold, resembling a
dark cloud, who bore on his breast scars of wounds inflicted on him by Airavata (the elephant who
carries Indra the Lord of celestials, on his back) with his tusks, wrapped in a cloak of red colour
resembling the colour of hare's blood and looked like a mass of clouds in the sky enveloped with
sunshine at sunset.
On seeing Ravana, Sugreeva got up all at once, while Rama and the chiefs of the army
of monkeys were looking on.
Gathering up his strength and courage, Sugreeva, in an impulse of fury, bounded from
the summit of the mountain and then sprang to the top of the gate (where Ravana was).
For a moment, he paused and then with a fearless soul, he saw that demon, whom he
regarded as a mere straw and thereafter spoke the following words harshly:
"O, demon! I am a friend and a servant of Rama, the Lord of the world. You will not
be spared by me today, by the inspiring grace of Rama."
Thus speaking, Sugreeva jumped up all at once, bounced over on ravana, pulled his
brightly coloured crown from his head and threw it away on the ground.
Seeing Sugreeva about to rush upon him again, Ravana spoke as follows: "You were
Sugreeva (one who has a handsome neck), when your were not present before my eyes. But now, you
will now become Hinagriva bereft of your neck."
Speaking thus, Ravana raised up and quickly flung Sugreeva to the ground with both
his arms. Bouncing like a ball, Sugreeva flung back his adversary with his arms.
Ravana and Sugreeva of great strength carried on a duel which was unbearable, with
perspiration broke out on their limbs, with their bodies red with blood, each clung to other other
paralyzing his opponent's movements resembling silk-cotton and Kimshuka trees, followed by blows of
fists, slaps of hands blows of elbows and blows of fingers on each other.
Having wrestled for a long time in the center of the flat floor of the gate way,
each in turn repeatedly lifting their bodies and bending their feet in a particular way, the two
highly swift combatants remained in that flat roof of the gate way.
Crushing one another and their bodies clung together, they both dropped down between
the defensive walls and the moat. They would leap up again, seizing each other from the ground,
after pausing an instant to regain their breath.
With arms interlaced like with ropes joined together, they remained locked together
in the struggle. Both of them, who had received training in wrestling and fully endowed with night,
were now moving to and fro in the arena.
The two heroes, who resembled a tiger and a a lion having their tusks growing or two
young lordly elephants encountening in a hostile manner, with arms interlaced and having duly tried
their strength, fell on the ground together.
Thereafter rising, those two heroes hurled themselves on each other, circling around
the arena again and again, like skilled and mighty wrestlers, nor were they easily fatigued.
Like unto great tuskers with their enormous arms resembling the trunks, those two
warriors were keeping back each other, fought vehemently for a long time and moved speedily in a
circular arena.
Approaching each other like tow wild cats fighting over a piece of meat trying to
kill each other, they stood growling again and again.
The two warriors, Sugreeva and Ravana, who were skilled in wrestling, excuted
innumerable and myraid evolutions, taking up diverse postures, moving in a curved line like an ox's
urine, coming and going, stepping side ways, having a retrograde motion to avoid blows, turning
about abandoning the attack, dashing towards each other, leaping, standing firm and erect,
retreated, turned sideways, rushed in a bent posture, ran lifting their foot to kick the opponent
and by letting go or stealing away.
Meanwhile, Ravana decided to common using his magic power. Knowing it, Sugreeva flew
into the sky triumphantly shaking off all fatigue, while Ravana, baffled by Sugreeva stood
confounded there alone.
Thus, the Lord of the monkeys, acquiring fame as a warrior, reducing Ravana to
exhaustion, ascended into the infinite sky and the offspring of the Sun then went to the side of
Rama, who as in the middle of the mokye-troops.
That Sugreeva, the offspring of the Sun, who was endowed with a speed of the wind,
having accomplished that feat there, increasing the military zeal of the foremost of Raghu dynasty,
honoured by the monkey leaders and delighted, rejoined the army.When that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, then the eminent-saint
  Vishvamitra on asking for the leave of absence from those kings, Dasharatha and Janaka, and from
  both Rama and Lakshmana, he set out to northern mountains, namely Himalayas. 
When Vishvamitra departed that ruler to the delight of people, namely Dasharatha,
  on asking leave of absence with king Janaka who outvies bodily affairs, promptly set forth for
  the city of Ayodhya. 
Then that king Janaka of Mithila, the one from Videha lineage, gave innumerable
  patrimonial riches. He has also given umpteen number of cows, millions of excellent shawls and
  silk dresses, and elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, besides hundreds of highly
  decorated girls, divine in their mien, as unexcelled chambermaids and handmaidens to the brides.
  
King Janaka gave beau idéal bridal riches in gold, silver, pearls and corals even,
  for he is very highly gladdened as Seetha's marriage came true. 
Having given many kinds of bridal gifts and having accompanied his daughters for a
  distance, then having received a bid adieu from Dasharatha, that sovereign of Mithila, Janaka,
  re-entered is own palace in Mithila. 
Even the king Dasharatha, the sovereign of Ayodhya proceeded with his noble-souled
  sons, keeping all the sages in the fore, while his forces followed him. 
But while going with the assemblages of sages and with young Raghava-s, namely
  Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, the sky-bound birds started to screech with startling voice
  from all around facing that tigerly-man Dasharatha. 
Also thus, all of the earth bound animals are going his leftward, and on seeing
  this, albeit he is a tigerly king he is perplexed, and particularly asked Vashishta. 
"Unpropitious is the starling voicing of birds, whereby my heart is throbbing
  down... and propitious is the leftward going of the animals, thereby my heart is throbbing up...
  why so?" 
On hearing all that is said by king Dasharatha, the instinctual sage Vashishta
  said this sentence in a soothing voice, "I will tell apart the result of these auguries...
  
"The shrieks voiced by the birds are foretokening the forthcoming providential and
  perilous trepidation, but the behaviour of these animals is betokening it as mitigable... hence,
  let this consternation be forsaken... 
While they are discussing among themselves, a whirlwind started to whirligig
  there, as though to shake the earth and shatter all gigantic trees. 
Murkiness enshrouded the sun, thus everyone is unaware of quarters, a sandstorm
  enwrapped that army, by which it has become as though ensorcelled. 
Then Vashishta and the other sages, the king Dasharatha along with his sons
  remained there with animation, and everything and every other one available there has become
  inanimate. 
In that catastrophic darkness, that sand-muffled military of king Dasharatha has
  seen the son of Sage Jamadagni, namely Bhaargava Rama, the subjugator of kings of kings. He
  appeared calamitous in his look by wearing tufty matted and unruly head-hair, an unassailable one
  like Mt. Kailash, an unbearable one like the Epoch-End-Fire, irradiant with his own radiance,
  hence imperceivable for commoners, and such as he is, he clinched an axe on his right shoulder
  and clasped a bow in his left hand, that in simile is like a congeries of electroluminescence,
  and handling an arrow which is as if ready to electrocute, and he vied in his overall look with
  the devastator of triple cities, namely God Shiva. 
On seeing him who is perilous in his propensity and flaming like the Ritual-fire,
  Vashishta and the other prominent Brahman-s who are the practisers of meditation and
  fire-oblations have come together and started to susurrate, up and down. 
"Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by
  the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously
  when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again,
  or what?" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. 
After their susurrus the sages have approached him, who in his very look is like a
  visitation, with oblational water and addressed him with benign words of greeting like, "oh,
  Rama, oh, Bhaargava Rama..." 
On receiving the deference paid by the sage Vashishta, that inexorable Rama of
  Jamadagni started to talk to Rama of Dasharatha. On hearing that sentence of Rama of Jamadagni, then Rama of Dasharatha said this to him in a courtly owing to the presence 
of his father Dasharatha. 
Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness towards your father, 
I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness from your paternal debt, but... 
"Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble 
one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness..." So said Rama to 
Bhaargava. 
Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that estimable weapon, 
namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow that is already fitted on it... 

On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim with it, but being 
indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of Jamagadni. 
Oh Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship with Vishvamitra, 
and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow that exterminates your life... 
Oh Bhaargava Rama, either this motility of yours at the speed of your mind, or even those unparalleled realms of heavens 
which you have earned by the power of your ascesis, I will eliminate whichever you wish... 
"This Vishnu's divine arrow is the conqueror of opponents' citadels, and a vanquisher of their vigour and vainglory, and 
it will not fall through wastefully... isn't it!" So said archer Rama to axeman Rama. 
Gods together with the assemblages of sages have come keeping the Grandparent Brahma at their fore, likewise the gandharva-s, 
apsara-s, siddha-s, caarana-s, kinnaraa-s, yaksha-s, sprites and reptilian beings have also come to see Rama who is now 
wielding the extraordinary longbow of Vishnu, and extremely amazing event that is going to ensue. 
Then, when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being rendered 
as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama of Dasharatha. 
Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama of Dasharatha, and 
he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly. 
Once, when I donated entire earth to Sage Kashyapa, Kashyapa told me 'uninhabitable is my domain, viz., this earth for 
you...' thus... 
Such as I was, in my observance of my mentor Kashyapa's order I do not spend nights on this earth from then afterwards, 
oh, Kakutstha Rama, as I made over this earth for Kashyapa, indeed... 
Thereby oh, valiant one, it will be inapt of you to impair this motility of mine, oh, Raghava, I will depart with the speed 
of cerebration to Mt. Mahendra, a par excellent mountain... 
But I triumphed over matchless realms of heavens with my ascesis, oh, Rama, you may hash them up with that irreversible 
arrow... let there be no time-lag... 
I have realized your touch of nature as that of the Immutable Supreme Being, God of Gods, the Exterminator of the demon 
Madhu, namely Vishnu, by the touch of your handling that bow... oh, enemy-inflamer, blessedness alone betides you... 
All of these gods who have come collectively are beholding you and your next move, for you are an unequalled one in your 
achievements and to whom there is no counter-dueller in conflicts... 
Oh, Kakutstha Rama, you are the lord of the triad of worlds, such as you are, you faced me down, and it is malapropos to 
say that this is a disgrace to me... 
"It will be apt of you to unloose that unsurpassed arrow, oh, Rama, as you have ethical commitment to wipe out demons as 
I wiped out menacing kings, and should you unloosen that arrow now I wish to depart to the ethereal mountain Mt. Mahendra, 
a point of no return for me..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. 
While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off that nonpareil arrow 
from that longbow of Vishnu. 
On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to 
Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain. 
Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, and the gods with 
the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised. 
Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to Rama of Dasharatha, 
went on his own way into oblivion. Dasaratha, glad after hearing the words of assembled people, requests Vasishta and Vamadeva to start arrangements for the anointing ceremony of Rama. Vasishta and Vamadeva order the officers present there to make all arrangements, describing them in detail. Dasaratha then orders Sumantra to bring Rama to the assembly. After letting Rama know of his desire, Dasaratha then advises Rama on how to rule the kingdom for the benefit of the people.
King Dasaratha, accepted their salutations with folded hands resembling lotus buds and spoke good and agreeable words to them as follows:-
"Oh! I am very much pleased and incomparable is my fortune in that you desire my
beloved elder son to be anointed as prince. "
King Dasaratha, thus duly returning the honor done by them, spoke while they were
listening, to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other Brahmans as follows:
"This is the glorious and auspicious month of Chaitra, in which the forests bloom
with flowers. Let all arrangements be made for the coronation of Rama as prince." While these words of the king were being completed, there was a great delightful uproar of the people.
When their applause gradually subsided, King Dasaratha spoke the following words to the best of sages, Vasishta.
"Oh Divine Vasishta! Be pleased to order now for the traditional ceremonial that is to be done and various accessories needed for the anointing ceremony of Rama."
Vasishta, the best of Brahmans, hearing the words of king Dasaratha, ordered the
officers who stood there with folded hands before the king, as follows: -
"Gather the following in the sacred fire house of the king at dawn: gold and the
like, diamonds, things needed to perform worship, various herbs, white floral garlands, corn, honey and clarified butter in separate vessels, new clothes, chariot, all weapons, the four divisions of army, an elephant with auspicious signs, white fan, flag staff, white umbrella, one hundred golden pots with brilliant shine, bull with gilded horns and a complete tiger skin".
"If any other small things are required, arrange for all of them. Let the doorways of the royal palace and those of the entire city be worshipped with sandalwood paste, floral garlands and good smelling incense."
"Let fine rice of good quality with milk and yogurt, fully sufficient for one
hundred thousand Brahmans be arranged."
"Let that rice be given with due respect to important Brahmans tomorrow at dawn;
along with clarified butter, yogurt, corn, and lot of gifts."
"There will be an invocation for the well being of all, tomorrow at sun rise. Let
brahmanas be invited and suitable seats be arranged for them."
"Let the flags be hung and the royal highways be sprinkled with water. Let well
dressed dancers and musicians wait in second enclosure in the royal compound."
"As worshipping is to be done in temples and at road junctions, let some deserving people gather there with rice, eatables, presents and garlands separately."
"Let all the warriors enter the well developed front yard of the royal palace with long swords, armors and clean clothing."
Those wise men Vasishta and Vamadeva attentively ordered for all those things to be done there, informed that to king Dasaratha and performed the remaining things also.
Pleased and satisfied with the arrangements made Vasishta and Vamadeva approached
king Dasaratha and told him that all had been done according to his words.
Afterwards, Dasaratha spoke to Sumantra "Let Rama, who has a disciplined intellect, be brought by you immediately."
As commanded by the king, Sumantra brought there, Rama, the best of charioteers, in a chariot.
Afterwards the kings belonging to east, west, north, south as well as those
belonging to Mlechha kingdom, Aryaa Vartha kingdom and those ruling in hill and forest areas sat there and attended on King Dasaratha as celestials attended on Devendra.
The sage king Dasaratha, sitting in the midst of those kings like Devendra in the
middle of the celestials, saw from the palace itself, his son Rama arriving in a chariot.
Rama was as beautiful as the king of Gandharvas. His valiance was world famous. He had great strength and walked like a vigorous elephant. He had long arms, and with his enchanting face, he looked like the moon. He stole the eyes and minds of the people by his looks, generosity and virtues. King Dasaratha was thus not satiated enough in seeing Rama, coming like a cloud that gladdens people by relieving them from the scorching summer heat.
Sumantra helped Rama to get down from the excellent chariot and with folded hands
followed behind Rama, who approached his father.
Rama, the best among men, ascended the steps of the palace, which resembled Mount
Kailaasa, along with Sumantra, to see the king Dasaratha.
Rama with folded hands approached his father, bowed down mentioning his own name and offered salutations to his father's feet.
King Dasaratha took into his embrace that beloved son who was standing humbly beside him with folded hands.
King Dasaratha gave Rama a great throne, which was high, excellent and beautiful,
decorated with gold and diamonds.
Rama, occupying that great throne, caused it to shine with his own brightness, just as the spotless sun in the morning causes Meru mountain to shine with brilliance.
Rama by his brilliance made that assembly to shine, just as the moon shines the
clear autumnal sky, with the dimless stars and planets.
King Dasaratha was as delighted in seeing his beloved son, as one delights in seeing oneself adorned, in a mirror.
King Dasaratha, the best among those who have sons, smilingly conversed with his
son, and addressed Rama as follows, as Kasyapa does to (his eldest son) Devendra (the ruler of  gods).
"Oh Rama! You are an exemplary son born to my exemplary elder wife. Being excellent in virtues, you are beloved son to me."
"O, Rama! As you with your good qualities cherished these people, you get the
princely kingdom on the day of Pushyami star (when the moon appears in conjunction with the constellation Pushya)."
"Oh, son! By nature, you are very humble and virtuous. Even then, because of my
friendship with you, I can tell you this for your benefit."
"Be even more humble and always keep the senses under control. Leave the bad habits born out of desire and wrath."
"Through direct and indirect means, keep ministers and others happy."
"Like the celestials becoming happy after obtaining the nectar, friends of a king
(ruler of earth) are delighted when he fills the granaries and armories to the brim, making the common people delightful and happy. Hence, you too act like this."
The well -wishers of Rama, after hearing those words, intending to do good to
Kausalya, immediately came to her and informed the matter to her.
The best among women, Kausalya gave away gold, cows and different types of diamonds to those who informed her good news.
Rama, after offering salutations to king Dasaratha, ascended the chariot and went to his splendid house after being worshipped by the crowds on the way.
Having heard those words of the king, seeing their dearest wish gratified, the
citizens took leave of the King Dasaratha and returned to their homes full of joy, in order to give thanks and render homage to the Gods.Seetha daughter of Janaka being pacified by Rama in the matter of living in the
forest, spoke the following words to her husband.
Distressed and highly agitated, the said Seetha reproached Rama having a broad
chest, from affection and pride in the following words:-
"What my father, the king of Mithila belonging to the country of Videha, think of
himself having got as so-in-law you, a woman having the form of a man?"
"It is a pity if these people of Ayodhya through ignorance tell the falsehood that excellent valour is lacking in Rama as in a blazing sun."
"For what reason are you cast down or whence fear in you, for which you are willing to desert me, for whom there is no other recourse."
"Oh, Brave man! Know me to be as dependent on your will as Savitri who was devoted to Satyavan the son of Dyumatsena."
"Rama, the faultless man! I will not see, even in thought, anyone except you as any other woman bringing disrepute to her family would! I shall accompany you to the forest."
" Oh, Rama! I am a young girl, lived for a long time with you, a chaste woman and
your wife. How would you like an actor intend to deliver me to oehrs by your own will?"
"Oh, Rama the sinless one! Be you always dutiful and obedient to him, whom you speak of welfare, for whose sake I am being kept back.(But it is improper to ask me to stay obedient to him)."
"It is not proper for you as such to set out to the forest without taking me. Any
term of austerities or forest or even heaven, let it be to me with you only."
"To me, who follow you behind, there will be no tiresomeness. I shall remain in the path without any fatigue, as remaining in a place of recreation or as in a sleep.
"While walking with you, blades of kusha grass, shrubs by the name of kaasa, reeds and rushes and plants with prickles which fall in the path will touch my soles like a heap of cotton or soft deerskin."
"Oh, beloved! I shall reckon the dust raised by the strongest wind that will cover my body as sandal dust of highest advantage."
"While dwelling in the forest, in its midst, I shall lie down on green grass. Will lying in beds with carpets be more comfortable than that?"
"Leaves, tubers and fruits either a little or abundant in quantity brought and given by you yourself will be like nectar to me."
"Enjoying the flowers and fruits belonging to various seasons there, I shall neither recollect my mother nor father nor my home."
"Hence, you are not justified to see anything unpleasant there. There will be no
annoyance to you because of me. I will not be difficult to be maintained."
"Your companionship will be a heaven to me. Without you, it will be a hell. Oh,
Rama! By knowing thus my great love, obtain supreme joy with me."
"On the contrary, if you do not take me, who is not alarmed of the forest as such, I shall drink poison now itself. But on no account would I bow to the enemies."
"Oh, Lord! As a result of grief I will not going to live even afterwards when
abandoned by you. Death is therefore better at the time of your relinquishment itself."
"I cannot bear this grief even for a moment, why again fourteen years in
misery."
Seetha, burnt by grief, having got exerted, lamented much piteously, embraced her
husband and cried a lot with loud voice.
persecuted with many homilies like a female elephant pierced with poisoned arrows, she shed tears that had long been held back even as a piece of wood would emit fire(throught attrition with another)
Crystal-like tears woozed from her eyes because of grief, like water-drops from two lotus flowers.
Her face with shining brilliance of the moon and having longish eyes, withered with tears as a lotus flower pulled out from water.
Then Rama embraced her, with arms, who was depressed and had fainted as it were,
spoke the following words, fully reassuring her.
"Oh, queen! I do not relish even heaven while you are in grief. There is indeed no fear whatsoever to me, like the god of Brahma.'
"Oh, Seetha with the auspicious face! Eventhough I am able to protect you, without knowing your entire opinion, I do not like to take you to the forest."
"Oh, Seetha! it appears that you are created indeed for dwelling in the forest with me. Hence, you cannot be left behind by me, like the honour by a man of self-regard."
"Oh Seetha, with thighs like the posteriors of an elephant! Earlier, righeousness
(like fulfilling the father's command) was practised by good men. Now, I shall follow that righteousness, like Suvarchala(wife of the sun) following the sun."
"Oh, Seetha! I cannot desist from not going to forest. That word, of my father, made strong by his truthfulnes is taking me to the forest."
"Oh, comely lady! Being obedient to father and mother is one's sacred duty. That is why, I do not wish to survive, in violation of that duty."
"Mother, father and teacher are at our own disposal. By negelecting them as such,
how can we worship god, who is not at our disposal, by various modes?"
"Oh, lady with enchanting glances! The triad of mother, father and teacher is the
world-triad. There is none other in the world equal to it. Hence, this triad is worthy of worship."
"Oh, Seetha! In which manner service to father is regarded as strengthening, in the same manner truth or sacrificial rites where presents are received by officiating priest are not strengthening."
"By compliance with the wishes of one's elders, heavenly bliss or riches, foodgrains or leaving, sons or amenities of life - nothing whatsoever is hard to obtain."
"High souled men, wholly devoted to their parents obtain the regions of gods and the gandharvas, the seventh heaven presided the gandharvas, the seventh heaven presided by Brahma (the creator) and Goloka (the highest heaven abiding in cows and presided over by Sri Radha and Sri Krishna the first couple).
"I desire to obey in the same manner as to how my father, abiding in truthfulness
and virtue, commands me. That itself is indeed the law of morality, which is eternal."
"Oh, Seetha! My mind was depressed to take you to the forest of Dandaka. But you are saying that you will reside in the forst, duly determined to follow me."
"Oh, mistress with fascinating eyes and flawless limbs! Since you were allowed to
come to forest, Oh Seetha the timid lady, follow me and become my help-mate."
"Oh, Seetha the beautiful! You adopted very auspicious resolve, suitable in all ways to me and to your race."
"Oh, lady with charming hip and loins! Now itself, begin with duties appropriate for living in exile. Oh, Seetha! Even a heaven is not a liking to me without your presence."
"Give valuable gifts to Brahmanas and food to mendicants. Be very quick. Do not
delay."
"Give to the various classes of your dependents whatever costly ornaments, beautiful and fine articles of wearing apparel, gadgets used for sports, my couches, conveyances and other articles left after satisfying brahmanas."
Seetha the divine lady, elated to know her departure acceptable to her husband,
quickly set about, making gifts.
Thereafter, the illustrious and pure-minded lady, becoming delighted on hearing the speech of her husband, started giving riches and valuable gifts to virtuous souls.Keeping ready Pushpaka the aerial car decorated with flowers, Vibhishana, for his
part, standing not very far, spoke to Rama (as follows):
"What more can I do?" thus spoke with haste, Vibhishana endowed as he was with
modesty and with joined palms, to Rama.
After some circumspection, Rama of great splendor, affectionately spoke the
following words to him, while Lakshmana was listening:
"Let all these monkeys and bears (ie. Denizens of forests), who performed tasks of
exertion, be honoured with tasks of exertion, be honoured with precious stones and riches of
various kinds, O Vibhishana!"
"O Vibhishana the king of demons! Lanka has conquered by you, in collaboration with
these monkeys, who never turned their backs in battles and fought joyfully, ignoring all risk to
their lives."
"All these monkeys, without exceptions, have accomplished their task. Reward their
achievement with gifts of gold and precious stones."
"Highly honoured in this way any duly cheered by you, acknowledging their services,
the chiefs of monkey-troops, will feel happy."
"All will come nearer to you, for having possessed this quality of generosity, for
propitiating them, for showing compassion to them and for having subjugated your senses. Hence, I
am reminding you."
"O king! Feeling agitated, the army deserts that king, who is bereft of all loving
qualities and who merely orders them to kill people in battle."
Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana honoured all those monkeys, by dispersing
precious stones and gold to them.
Thereafter, having seen on that occasion all those commanders of monkey-troops
honoured with precious stones and gold, Rama then mounted that excellent aerial car.
He mounted the aerial car along with Lakshmana, his valiant brother wielding a bow
and taking the illustrious Seetha, who was feeling abashed, in his arms.
Bestowing attention on all the monkeys as well as Vibhishana and the mighty
Sugreeva, Rama remaining in the aerial car, spoke (as follows):
"O the foremost of monkeys! This work of a friend has been accomplished by you.
Permitted by me, all of you can go, where you will."
"O Sugreeva! All that which ought to be done by an affectionate and service-minded
friend, has been done for your part by you, trembling alive as you are to righteousness.
Accompanied by your army, proceed to Kishkindha at once."
"O Vibhishana! Settle down in your kingdom at Lanka, conferred by me. Even the
celestials including Indra shall not be able to attack you."
" I am going to Ayodhya, the seat of government of my father. I bid adieu to you and
wish to take leave of you all."
Hearing the words of Rama, the monkey-chiefs, the monkeys, Vibhishana the demon and
all of them there, with their joined palms, spoke (as follows):
"We also wish to proceed to Ayodhya. You take all of us there we shall range the
gardens and groves there with rejoice."
"O the excellent king! Seeing you, drench with ablution (in the coronation ceremony)
and offering our salutations to Kausalya, we shall return to our homes."
Hearing those words of the monkeys and Vibhishana, that pious-minded Rama spoke to
those monkeys, Sugreeva and Vibhishana as follows:
"Something more dearer than everything dear will be achieved by me, if I reach
Ayodhya with the host of my friends along with all of you, for, I shall feel delighted."
"O Sugreeva! Mount the aerial cars quickly, along with the monkeys. O Vibhishana,
the king of demons! You also ascend it, along with your counsellors."
Thereupon, that Sugreeva along with the monkeys gladly ascended that wonderful
Pushpaka, the aerial car. Vibhishana together with his counselors also ascended it.
When all of them ascended, that excellent aerial car, belonging to Kubera, flew into
the sky, after having been duly authorized by Rama.
Feeling greatly rejoiced and satisfied while travelling in that splendid aerial car,
which was now in the air and was provided with the image of a swan, Rama shone like Kubera.
All those mighty monkeys, bears and demons sat comfortably and spaciously in that
wonderful aerial car.While Shabari ascended to heaven with her own divine self-resplendence, Raghava who is with Lakshmana 
started to cogitate over the magnificence of Matanga disciples. 
That noble-souled Raghava on thinking about the efficacy of the disciples of Matanga, said to Lakshmana, 
who is the maintainer of Rama's well being, and who is thinking single-mindedly. 
"I have seen a highly astounding hermitage of self-controlled sages, oh, gentle Lakshmana, in which 
the deer and tigers are at home, and which is adored by divers birds... 
"Oh, Lakshmana, holy is our taking a bath in this holy Pampa Lake, for it is formed by the waters of 
seven seas, and even holier is our oblation of this holy waters to manes... 
"What that was unpropitious for us is completely abated by our holy bath and holy oblations, oh, Lakshmana, 
propitiousness is standing en face us, thereby presently this heart of mine is highly gladdening... 
oh, lion-like man, indeed, heart alone hatches hope... 
"Thereby, where Mt. Rishyamuka is beaming forth at its nearby, on which that right minded son of the 
Sun, Sugreeva, is living along with four other vanara-s, always frightened by the fear from Vali, we 
will go to her, to that spectacular Lake Pampa, come on, Lakshmana... 
"I am also hasty to see that best one among vanara-s, Sugreeva, for my enterprise called search for 
Seetha is under his aegis, isn't it... 
To that brave Rama who is speaking thus, Soumitri said this, " my heart too is hastening me, let us 
go there promptly..." 
Then that Lord of People and Lord of Nature on exiting from that hermitage, he then came nigh of Lake 
Pampa along with Lakshmana. 
Rama on scrutinising that rosy woodland in which everywhere there are outsized and diverse trees that 
are thickset with flowers, and different lakes loaded with the trilling birds like plovers, peacocks, 
waterfowls and suchlike, with which that woodland itself is trilling in much ado, became impassioned 
as he is instantly rendered thus by Love-god, and thus that Rama went towards that lovely Lake Pampa. 

Rama spotted Pampa Lake from a distance which is plethoric with water, but entered into a lake called 
Matanga Lake on his way to Pampa... 
Though both Raghava-s came there composedly and dispassionately, but Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is 
ensorcelled by anguish on seeing a ladylike lake Pampa. 
Rama entered the area of that beautiful lake which is beaming forth with lotuses hemming in from inside, 
and trees like Tilaka, Ashoka, Punnaga, Bakula, Uddala, are hemming it from outside. 
That lake is huddled with delightful fringe lands and lotuses squeeze it from within, and its water 
is plethoric and crystalline, and its sand is softish all over. 
That lake is beautified with packs of fishes and tortoises, and packs of trees on its banks, on which 
climber plants are wraparound like the ladyloves of those trees. 
And that is adored by the beings like sylvan, reptilian, celestial, georgic, and elfish beings, and 
it is overcrowded with trees and tendrils, and it is a trove for fairish and clodish water. 
The lotuses of the lake are rich in their fragrance, and with the heaps of clusters of reddish, whitish, 
and blackish lotuses, and with such pinkish, whitish, and reddish lotuses the sheet of water is like 
a picturesquely painted canvas and it is surrounded by the orchards of flowered mango trees and sounded 
much by the screams of peacocks. 
Then Rama along with Lakshmana on seeing at that Pampa Lake, that self-refulgent son of Dasharatha whimpered 
over, owing to his passionate recollection of Seetha. 
That Pampa Lake is wraparound with the trees of Tilaka, Citron-fruits, Banyan, White-trees, likewise 
flowered are flowery trees like Red oleanders, Punnaaga, shrubs of Maalati and Kunda, likewise flowered 
are the trees of Madder, Nicula, Ashoka, and Seven-leaved banana plants, and plants of Mogra and climbers 
of Maadhavii Lata are also flowered, and with them she that Ladylike Pampa shone forth like a pulchritudinous 
lady. 
The aforesaid mountain renowned as Rishyamuka which is abounding with colourful ores and amazingly flowered 
trees is there on the bank of Pampa Lake. 
A noble soul by his name Risharaja was there and that monkey's son is the highly valiant Sugreeva, thus 
he is renowned, and he presides over that mountain. 
That best one among men Rama, said this way, "oh, Lakshmana, you make a headway for that chief of monkeys, 
Sugreeva..." and further said this to Lakshmana whose valiance is truthfulness alone, "how can I possibly 
live without Seetha..." 
Such as he is whose thinking is applying itself to Seetha alone, and who is vocalising his anguish for 
her, to whom aa stymie is laid by the Love-god just at the appearance that lake, that Rama on saying 
that sentence in that way to Lakshmana neared that superb and heart delighting lotus Lake Pampa. 
On going step by step, and on going on seeing ardently and intently at that forest which has picturesque 
visuals of forestry, and which is with hurly-burly birds, not one, but numerous and divers are they, 
and then Rama along with Lakshmana on entering the area of that lake, has seen that Lake Pampa. Then, those surviving troops of demons hastily told Ravana that Devantaka, Trishira,
Atikaya and other foremost of demons had been killed.
Thereupon, suddenly hearing of those who had been killed, Ravana the prosperous king
of demons, having his eyes filled with profuse tears; boarding over the terrific destroyal of his
son as also the death of his brothers, contemplated for long.
Then, seeing Ravana the king, miserably submerged in a sea of sorrow, Indrajit,
Ravana's son, the best among charioteers, spoke to him as follows:
"O father, the king of demons! You ought not to get embarrassed, while Indrajit is
alive. Anyone who is struck by Indrajit's arrows cannot indeed protect his life."
"Today, you will see Rama along with Lakshmana, with their bodies undistinguished,
scattered and dead, lying down on the floor, with their limbs diffused all over."
"Listen to Indrajit's promise, which is very firm, backed by valour and divine
blessing. Now itself, I will overwhelm Rama together with Lakshmana unfailing flood of arrows.
"Now itself, Indra, Yama, Vishnu, Rudra, Sadhyas (a class of celestial beings), the
fire-god, the sun and the moon can see my unlimited prowess, like the terrific prowess of Vishnu
(in his dwarf incarnation as Vamana) in the enclosure where a sacrifice was being performed by
Bali, the demon-king."
Thus speaking, that Indrajit, with an undepressed mind, after seeking permission
from the king, mounted his chariot with a speed equal to that of wind and yoked with excellent
donkeys.
That greatly resplendent Indrajit, the annihilator of enemies, having ascended a
chariot looking like the chariot of the sun, quickly went to the battle-front.
Many mighty demons with terrific prowess, with joy, holding excellent bows in their
hands, carrying lances, sharp-edged spears, swords, axes and maces as also armed with Bhushundis
(probably a kind of fire arms), mallets, cudgels, Shataghnis (cylindrical piece of wood studded
with iron spikes) and iron rods, followed that great souled Indrajit. Some rode on the back of
elephants, some ascended excellent horses, tigers, scorpions, cats, donkeys and camels,
looking.
That valiant Indrajit swiftly went to the battle-field with full blasts of couches
and kettle-drums.
Indrajit, the tormentator of enemies, with a parasol white as a couch and the moon,
shone like the sky with the full moon.
The valiant Indrajit, the foremost among all the wielders of bow and decked with
gold ornaments, was being fanned then with supremely charming whisks with handles of gold.
Seeing that son setting out with a large army, that glorious Ravana, the king of
demons, spoke as follows:
"O my dear son! There is no charioteer who can stand you as your rival. Indra the
lord of celestials was conquered by you. You can kill Rama, a mere human being, who is assailable.
How much more can I tell?" After hearing these words of Ravana Indrajit accepted his great
blessings.
With that Indrajit, having a splendour equal to that of the sun and having no
warrior who can stand him as his rival, the City of Lanka shone, like the sky shining with the
sun.
Reaching the battle-field, Indrajit of great splendour, the annihilator of enemies,
stationed his demons around his chariot.
Then, that foremost of demons, having a radiance equal to that of fire, with
excellent sacrificial incantations, performed a sacrifice, as per rules, making an oblation to the
fire.
That valiant leader of demons offered oblations to fire there, with garlands and
pounded sandalwood, including clarified butter and parched grain.
That sacrificial rite was performed with weapons serving as reeds, chips of
Vibhishaka tree serving as fuel, then using red pieces of cloth and the sacrificial ladle made of
iron.
Duly spreading fire with reeds (in the form of other weapons) accompanied by lances
there, Indrajit elapsed the neck of a live goat of dark hue (for offering it to the fire as an
oblation).
From the great fire of flames, set ablaze by that offering having been thrown into
it acting at once without smoke, appeared such signs as had beckoned victory (of the past).
The fire, resembling the molten gold, rising up on its own and having flames
revolving from left to right, accepted that oblation.
Indrajit, who was skilled in the use of mystic missiles, invoked the missile
presided over by Brahma and charged it on his bow, chariot and all.
While that missile was being invoked and the sacrificial fire propitiated, the
firmament including the sun, the moon, other planets and lunar mansions trembled with fear.
Having propitiated offering in fire, Indrajit, having a splendour shining like the
fire, having a might similar to that of Indra, and possessing an unimaginable prowess, became
himself invisible in the sky, with the bow, arrows, sword, chariot, horses, charioteer and all.
Then, the army of demons, extensive with horses and chariots, embellished by banners
and flags, set out with a desire to fight, roaring.
They killed the monkeys in the battle-field with many wonderful and ornamental
arrows, possessing great velocity as also lances and goads.
Seeing those demons, the most enraged Indrajit on his part spoke to them as follows:
"All of you fight enthusiastically with an intent to kill the monkeys."
Roaring with a desire for victory, all those demons thereafter terribly rained
showers of arrows on monkeys.
That Indrajit, on his part, along with his demons in the battle-field, destroyed the
monkeys with Nalika (broad-headed) arrows, steel arrows, maces and clubs.
Those monkeys, wielding trees as their weapons, being struck in the battle-field,
quickly rained mountains and trees on Indrajit.
Indrajit the son of Ravana, on his part, possessing great splendour and great
strength, was enraged and wounded the bodies of the monkeys.
Bringing enormous delight to the demons that enraged Indrajit severed off the
monkeys by nines, fives and sevens with a single arrow.
That most invincible chief of demons, with arrows decked with gold, having
brilliance equal to the sun, destroyed the monkeys in battle.
Those monkeys, tormented by the arrows in battle, with their limbs severed, fell
down with their aspirations shaken, like the great demons fallen down by the celestials.
Those excellent monkeys with anger attacked Indrajit, who was tormenting them like
the sun with his terrific ray-like the sun with his terrific ray-like arrows.
Then, all the monkeys, with their bodies severed, having lost their consciousness
and perturbed as they were, having their limbs dampened with blood, took to their heels.
Those monkeys, wielding mountains as their weapons, roaring in the battle field,
without turning back, abandoned their lives, showing their courage for the sake of Rama.
Continuing to stay in the battle-field, those monkeys rained trees, mountain-peaks
and rocks on Indrajit.
Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battles, kept off that great rain
of deadly hail of trees and rocks.
Thereupon, the capable Indrajit with his arrows, identical of fire and looking like
serpents in battle, split the armies of monkeys.
Indrajit struck Gandhamadana with eighteen sharp arrows and also struck Neela, who
was standing at a far-away place, with nine arrows.
Indrajit having a great prowess, struck Mainda with seven arrows, which can tear
asunder vital parts and also struck Gaja with five arrows in battle.
Indrajit then struck Jambavan with ten arrows and Nila with thirty arrows. He also
struck Sugreeva, Rishabha, Angada and Dvivida with sharp and terrific arrows endowed with boons and
made them breathless.
That enraged Indrajit, then looking like an excited fire that is to destroy the
world, tormented other chiefs of monkeys too with many arrows.
He harassed the armies of monkeys' fast-moving arrows looking like the sun in their
splendour.
That enthusiastic Indrajit, with a great pleasure, saw that exclusive army of
monkeys, drenched in blood and tormented by a multitude of arrows.
Indrajit, the son of Ravana, possessing a great splendour power and strength, again
generating a terrific rain of arrows and weapons, destroyed the army of monkeys from all sides.
Leaving off his army from that great battle-field and becoming invisible, Indrajit
advanced towards the monkeys and quickly rained terrific hail of arrows on those armies of monkeys,
as black cloud downpours the rain.
In that battle, those mountain-like monkeys as victims of conjuring tricks with
their bodies torn into pieces by Indrajit's arrows and roaring as they were with discordant notes,
fell down on earth, like mountains struck by Indra's thunder bolt.
Those monkeys in battle saw only arrows with pointed tips falling on the armies of
monkeys. They could not see there, that Indrajit the demon, the enemy of Indra, remaining concealed
by his conjuring trick.
Then, the mighty Indrajit, the leader of demons, covered all the quarters with
hundreds of sharply pointed arrows, having splendour of the sun and tore asunder the
monkey-chiefs.
Indrajit excessively rained on the army of monkeys' pikes, swords and axes, shining
like augmented and flaming fire and shooting forth incandescent flames with sparks.
Struck by the Indrajit's arrows, shining brightly as fire, the monkey-commanders
then looked like Kimshuka trees bearing crimson flowers.
Those excellent monkeys, torn asunder by that chief of demons, approaching at each
other and roaring in a discordant tone, fell down on the ground.
Banged in the eyes by arrows, some monkeys looking up towards the sky, joined each
other and fell down on the floor.
With lances, spikes and sharp arrows, charged with sacred texts, Indrajit the
excellent demon struck all those foremost of monkeys, namely Hanuman, Sugreeva, Angada,
Gandhamadana, Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarshina, Mainda, Dvivida, Nila, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Kesari,
Hariloma, Vidyuddamshtra, Suryanana, Jyothimukha, a monkey called Dadhimukha, Pavakaksha, Nala as
also a monkey named Kumuda.
Tearing asunder the principal monkey-warriors by maces and arrows, which were of
golden colour, that Indrajit rained a multitude of showers of arrows equal to sun's rays on Rama
and Lakshmana.
Ignoring that showering rain of arrows, as though they are mere showers of rain,
that Rama of the most wonderful luster, looking around thoroughly, then spoke to Lakshmana as
follows:
"O Lakshmana! This Indrajit, by a great missile, is throwing down our army of
monkeys and tormenting us incessantly with his sharp arrows."
"How can the mighty and composed Indrajit on whom a boon has been bestowed by Brahma
and who has concealed his terrible form who stands with his weapons uplifted eventhough his body is
visible be killed in the battle today?
"I think the self-born Brahma who is the source of the universe is inconceivable and
this missile is presided over by him. O wise one! Remaining undistracted in mind, you bear along
with me today the hail of arrows here."
"Let this chief of demons, who is surpassing all, be covered with a multitude of
showers of arrows. This entire army of Sugreeva, whose leading warriors have fallen, looks no more
charming."
"Finding both of us fallen unconscious without displaying any joy or anger as also
having desisted from fighting, Indrajit will certainly return to Lanka, after having obtained
laurels of battle in its beginning itself."
Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana there became struck by a multitude of arrows of
Indrajit. That leader of demons also there, causing affliction to both of them, roared with a
thrill of rapture in battle.
Thus causing the army of monkeys along with Rama and Lakshmana to become despondent
in battle, that Indrajit, getting eulogized by the demons, quickly reached the city of Lanka which
was being protected by Ravana's arms. Then, Indrajit cheerfully informed all that had happened, to
his father.The valiant army-chiefs of monkeys stayed on Suvela mountain for that night and saw
the garden and groves in Lanka.
Seeing those gardens which were levelled, beautiful, spacious, majestic and
enchanting to look at, they became astonished.
Thick with Champaka, Ashoka, Vakula Sala and palmyra trees, covered with groves of
Tamala and Panasa trees, surrounded with rows of Nagakesara trees, Lanka looked splended on all
sides like the city of Amaravati reigned by Indra the god of celestials, with green lawns and
variegated avenues and with beautiful trees of various kinds like Hintala, Arjuna, Nipa Saptaparna
in full flowering, Tilaka, Karnikara and Patal whose crests were laden with flowers and which were
intertwined with climbers laden with multi-coloured flowers and red tender leaves.
The trees there were laden with fragrant and greatly enchanting flowers and fruits,
as human beings were laden with ornaments.
That garden, which bore flowers and fruits in relation to all seasons and with full
of bees, like chaitraratha (garden of Kubera, the god of riches), was quite charming, like Nandana
(garden of Indra the Lord of celestials)
In that garden abounding in cascades, the songs of birds like gallinules,
lapwings(small white cranes), dancing peacocks and cuckoos were heard.
Then, those monkeys, thrilling with rapture, delighted, brave and assuming any shape
at will, entered the aforesaid groves and gardens, with birds ever excited with joy, wandered by
bees, with clusters of trees occupied by cuckoos, having variegated sounds of birds and song of the
large bees, abounding with sounds of ospreys, with the music of wagtails and cries of canes.
While those mighty and splendid monkeys were entering the groves a breeze with
flowery fragrance, delightful to the nose, blew.
Some other troop-leaders of the valiant monkeys came out of their troops with due
permission from sugreeva and went towards Lanka, the city adorned with flags
Those monkeys, great in making noises causing the birds to frighten and displeasing
to the animals and elephants, went, causing that Lanka to tremble, by their noises.
Those monkeys with great speed marched ahead, making the earth flattened by their
feet and the dust thus raised by their feet went up instant aneously.
Frightened by that sound, bears lions buffaloes elephants, deers and birds were
trembled and terrified and hastened towards ten different directions.
The solitary peak of Trikuta mountain, which is so high as if touching the sky, all
over covered with flowers entirely, resembling gold; to an extent of eight hundred miles; bright;
charming to look at, beautiful, glorious, majestic, inaccessible even by birds, hard to be ascended
by people may, even by the mind-how much more by an act of walking?
Lanka, ruled by Ravana, with a breadth of eighty mile and a length of one hundred
sixty miles, was located on the apex of the mountain there.
The city of Lanka looked beautiful with its towering City-gates resembling white
clouds as well as with golden and silver ramparts.
The city of Lanka, greatly adorned by palaces and seven storied mansions, looked
like the sky with clouds at the end of a summer and as a region of Vishnu (the god of preservation)
between earth and heaven.
A palace, duly graced with a thousand pillars, which looked like a peak of Mount
Kailasa was three in the City of Lanka, which was always the City of Lanka, which was always
protected by a complete army of demons. The palace seemed to be scraping the skies and was to be
seen as an ornament to the City of Ravana.
The glorious Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana along with monkeys saw that
charming golden city of Ravana, graced with mountains picturesque with various minerals, splendid
with gardens reechoing with songs of birds of every kind, frequented by varieties of deer, richly
endowed with various kinds of flowers, inhabited by demons of every degree and duly flourishing,
having increased its wealth.
Beholding that City, which looks like heaven and crammed with huge palaces, the
valiant Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana was seized with astonishment.
Rama with his great army saw that City, full of precious gems, having all kinds of
facilities, adorned with rows of mansions, having excellent doors with huge mechanical appliances
and with a large armed forces protecting the City.Then ensued a fierce and a prolonged chariot-duel between Rama and Ravana, which was
frightful to all the worlds.
Then, the army of demons and the huge army of mokeys, stood motionless with their
weapons held fast in their hands.
Having their hearts captivated in seeing those two warriors, a human being and a
demon, both in full strength engaged in a fight, all for their part experienced a great wonder.
Having their hands occupied with various kinds of weapons, all those warriors stood
amazed in mind in beholding that duel. They did not go for war on each other.
The demons beholding Ravana and the army of monkeys seeing Rama with their eyes in
amazement appeared as though they were paintings.
Having made up their minds and being firm in their anger, those two warriors for
their part, Rama and Ravana fought fearlessly, as it were, on seeing the portents in the
battle.
Rama, who was convinced that he was going to win and Ravana who was firmly persuaded
that he would die, then demonstrated the entire wealth of their prowess in battle on that
occasion.
Thereupon, the valiant Ravana, fitting his arrows with anger, released them,
directing them towards the flag-staff fixed on Rama's chariot.
Without even reaching the ensign on Indra's chariot and touching off the staff which
supported the banner of the chariot, the arrows fell on the ground.
Thereafter, the valiant Rama too, in great anger, stretching his bow, proceeded with
his mind, to return blow for blow.
Rama released a sharp arrow, looking like a huge serpent and which was unbearable,
as though blazing with its own splendour, directing towards Ravana's flag-staff.
As the brilliant Rama released the arrow towards the flag-staff, that arrow, tearing
asunder Ravana's flag-staf, entered the earth.
That standard, mounted on Ravana's chariot, having been torn off, fell on the
ground. Seeing the thrown-down piece of his flag-staff, that mighty Ravana stood blazing as though
he was laughing with intolerance. Flaming up with anger, he showered a stream of arrows afflicted
as he was, with the power of wrath.
Ravana struck Rama's horses with blazing arrows. Those divine horses were neither
shaken nor stumbled in the battle-field. They were indeed healthy at heart and felt as though they
were just struck with lotus-stalks.
Seeing those horses unstumbled, Ravana then was very much enraged and released
showers of arrows.
He also hurled maces, iron bludgeons, discs, iron clubs, mountain-tops, trees,
spikes and axes.
Unwearied as he was in his heart and in effort, Ravana then employed streams of
missiles as a creation of magic and also thousands of arrows.
In that battle, abundant rain of various missiles, which were tumultuous, generating
fear, terrific and attended with a terrible echo, descended.
Leaving alone Rama's chariot, Ravana released arrows on the army of monkeys on all
sides, thus wholly covering the sky.
Ravana released arrows with a mind, which had given up all hope of survival. Seeing
that Ravana, who was interested in the battle, putting forth his great effort, Rama fitted Sharp
arrows to his bow, as though laughing and thereupon he loosed the arrows in hundreds and
thousands.
Seeing those arrows, Ravana completely covered the sky with his own arrows. Due to
that dazzling shower of arrows then employed by the two warriors, the shining sky looked like a
second sky built with arrows.
While Rama and Ravana were discharging the arrows thus in the battle0field, no arrow
missed the target, no one failed to pierce the target and none had gone in vain. Colliding with
each other, they fell on the ground.
Releasing the arrows left and right continually, they fought at each other. With
their terrific arrows, they made the sky, bereft of even a breathing space.
Rama struck Ravana's horses. Ravana struck Rama's horses. Both the warriors then
struck at each other, doing anything before and after.
Those two extremely enraged warriors in this way, carried out are excellent combat.
A tumultuous battle ensued for an hour or so, causing the hair to stand erect.
The mighty Ravana and Rama carried out the fight well with sharp arrows in the
battle-field. That Ravana at that time was very much enraged with Rama, as his flag-staff was
thrown down.
All the created beings for their part gazed with an astonished mind on Rama and
Ravana, who thus were fighting at each other in the battle-field.
Furiously attacking each other in the battle-field, those excellent chariots of the
two warriors ran towards each other.
Intent on destroying each other, those chariots, displaying various types of
movements such as, moving in circles, moving straight and darting forward as also receding
forthwith, originated from the capabilities of those charioteers, assumed a terrible aspect.
Rama wounding Ravana and Ravana too wounding Rama, both of them had recourse to
speed in movement in their forward and backward motions.
Those excellent chariots, casting streams of arrows, strolled in the battle-field,
like two clouds pouring showers.
Showing various kinds of movement in the battle-field, those chariots then again
stood facing each other.
The shaft of the two chariots even as they stood at that moment, met one with the
other shaft the muzzle of the horses met the one with the other and the flags met the one with the
other flags.
Then Rama, with his four sharp arrows discharged from his bow, drove back the four
splendid horses of Ravana.
That Ravana, falling a prey to anger for retreating his horses, discharged sharp
arrows on Rama.
Rama, who was severely struck by the mighty Ravana, did not get upset nor was even
tottered.
Directing towards Matali, Indra's charioteer, Ravana hurled arrows with a sound
similar to that of a thunder-bolt.
Arrows of great speed, fallen on Matali's body, did not cause even a pretty little
of bewilderment or hurt on him in that battle.
Enraged at that daring attack on Matali, Rama who for his part did not feel provoked
by the attack on himself, made his enemy turn away by hurling a net work of arrows on him.
The valiant Rama discharged twenty, thirty, sixty and hundreds and thousands of
arrows on the enemy's chariot.
Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in the chariot,
tormented Rama, by showering maces and mallets on him in the battle.
The battle thus started again by then, was tumultuous, causing one's hair to stand
erect. With the sounds of maces, mallets and iron rods and with the gusts raised by the plumes
adorning the flying arrows, the seven agitated oceans felt disquieted.
Thousands of all the demons and serpents, inhabiting in the nethermost subterranean
region of the agitated oceans, felt disturbed.
The entire earth, including mountains, groves and forests trembled. The sun too
became gloomy even the wind did not blow.
Then, the gods along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas the
semi-divine beings, great sages and all including Kinnaras the mythical beings and great serpents
became disquieted.
At that time, those gods along with troops of sages, saying "May all be well with
the cows and Brahmanas, May all the worlds endure forever, May Rama conquer Ravana!", saw a
terrific battle between Rama and Ravana, which caused one's hair to stand on end.
Seeing that matchless struggle and observing that the sky is its own compeer and the
ocean is its own analogue, the battle between Rama and Ravana can be likened only to the battle
between Rama and Ravana, the hosts of Gandharvas the celestial musicians and Apsaras, the heavenly
lymphs, looked on that battle between Rama and Ravana.
Thereupon, the great-armed Rama who augmented the fame of the kings born in Raghu
dynasty, stretching with anger, the serpent-like arrow with his bow, chopped off the glorious head
of Ravana, which was graced with blazing ear-rings. Then, all the three worlds saw that head,
fallen on the ground.
Another head, exactly similar to that head, cropped up on the shoulders of Ravana.
That second head was again chopped off by Rama, possessing a swift hand and who was swift in his
act.
The second head of Ravana was cut off by arrows in that battle. Soon after that head
was chopped off, it again rose into view.
Rama chopped off that head too with his arrows looking like thunderbolts. In the
same manner, a hundred of Ravana's heads of equal splendour were chopped off by Rama.
Yet, no certainty about Ravana's death could be seen. Thought equipped with many
arrows and well-versed with all kinds of missiles, the valiant Rama, the augmentor of Kausalya's
joy, then became thoughtful (said to himself as follows):
"What is the reason, these arrows by which Mareecha, Khara, Dushana, Kabandha in
Kroucha-forest, and Viradha in Dandaka-forest were killed, by which seven Sala trees and the
mountains were burst, by which Vali was killed and the ocean shaken up all these arrows which
provided immediate succour to me in battle, have proved of little efficacy in the case of
Ravana."
Thus absorbed in thought, Rama remained vigilant in the battle-field. He showered
streams of arrows in Ravana's chest.
Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in his chariot,
tormented Rama by showering maces and mallets on him in the combat.
That great tumultuous battle, which caused one's hair to stand on end, took place in
the sky, on the ground and furthermore on the mountain.
While the gods, the demons, Yakshas the super-natural beings, the devils, the
serpents and the ogres were witnessing, that great battle occurred for seven days.
There was no respite in battle between Rama and Ravana, either in the might or in
the day-time or for an hour or even for a instant.
Not beholding the victory of Rama in the combat between Rama and Ravana that
great-souled Matali, the charioteer of Indra quickly spoke the following words to Rama, who was
still engaged in fighting.Then, turning away from the mountain, Rama (The prospective ruler of Kosala) showed Seetha (the daughter of the King of Mithila) the beautiful river of Mandakini carrying splendid waters.
The lotus-eyed Rama spoke to Seetha, (the daughter of Janaka) who was having an
elegant waist and whose face resembled the moon:
"Behold this charming river of Mandakini, with its multi-coloured sandy beaches,
frequented by swans and geese and laden with flowers."
"Behold this river, hedged on all sides with various kinds of flowers and fruits,
growing on its banks and enhance its loveliness like the lake (Sangadhika) of Kubera (the ruler of Yakshas)"
"At this moment, its pleasant fords, where herds of deer drink and make the waters turbid, create ecstasy in me."
"O, beloved Seetha! Sages with matted locks and wearing antelope-skins and having
bark of trees for their upper garment, take a dip in the River Mandakini, at the appointed hour."
"O, Lady of wide eyes! Here are some other sages of austere vows, worshipping the
sun with uplifted arms; as per the scriptural injunctions."
"The trees, their crowns agitated by the breeze, that shower down leaves and flowers on both sides of the river cause the mountain to appear as though it were dancing!"
"See this River Mandakini with its crystal-like clear water at some places, with its shining sand-dunes at some places and crowded with Siddhas who are bathing at some other places."
"Behold you, heaps of flowers shaken down by the wind and shattered. See some other heaps of flowers floating, O lady with slender waist!"
"O, Kalyani! Behold the sweet-voiced ruddy geese, ascending the banks uttering
harmonious tones."
"I consider this sight of Mandakini River and of Chitrakuta, particularly at your
sight, to be more delightful than dwelling in the City of Ayodhya, O, lovely woman!"
Here are Siddhas (semi-divine beings endowed with mystic powers), free from
impurities and rich in asceticism, with their senses and mind under control, who perpetually stir the waters. You too should take a dip in the river along with me."
"Enter the Mandakini River, as on the breast of a friend, submerging the red and
white lotuses in it- O, Lovely Seetha!"
"My darling! Think of the wild beasts as inhabitants of the city of Ayodhya, this
mountain of Chitrakuta as the city of Ayodhya and this river as the Sarayu from now on!"
"O, Seetha!; The virtuous Lakshmana is obeying my commands and you too are
well-disposed, causing delight to me."
"Bathing three times a day in the river and living on honey, roots and fruits in
your company, I do not desire for the kingdom nor do I long for Ayodhya now."
"There is none in the world, who would not be relieved of his fatigue and feel
refreshed on the banks of this enchanting river, frequented by herds of elephants, who with lions and monkeys, come here to drink and which is adorned with innumerable flowers in full bloom."
Describing the varied beauties of the Mandakini River, Rama the bestower of delight to Raghu dynasty with his beloved consort as a companion, strolled in the lovely mountain of Chitrakuta which was shining like a piece of collieries."On seeing dreary Lakshmana coming into the void of forest devoid of Vaidehi, then the virtue-souled 
Rama, the son of Dasharatha, has asked him impatiently. 
"She who has come in tow with me to Dandaka forest when I started for peregrination, whom you have now 
deserted and came here, oh, Lakshmana, she that Vaidehi, where is she? 
"When I have become forlorn with the forfeiture of my kingdom and when I was rushing for Dandaka forest 
she stood with me as a partaker in my woes. She that comely Vaidehi, where is she? 
"Without whom I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, valiant one, such a Seetha who in simile 
is like the daughter of deities and who is my life-force, where is she? 
"I am unambitious for the rulership either on heavens or on the earth, oh, Lakshmana, without the daughter 
of Janaka whose aspect glisters like gold. 
"Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my lives, will she be alive somehow! Oh, valiant Lakshmana, this peregrination 
of mine, will it not become futile, someway! 
"When I am dead for the sake of Seetha and when you get back to Ayodhya lonesomely, and when Kaikeyi's 
wishes are accomplished thus, oh, Soumitri, will she be comfortable, somewhat! 
"Kaikeyi is with her son, with a kingdom, and further her 'purposes are achieved,' oh, gentle Lakshmana, 
and because of the death of her son will my austerely mother Kausalya humbly get into the servitude 
of Kaikeyi, anyhow! 
"I wish to get at the hermitage again if only that Vaidehi of good-conduct is alive in hermitage, else, 
oh, Lakshmana, if death has already conducted her out of hermitage I too will give up my lives here 
itself. 
"If Seetha, the princess from Videha, does not chat with me as before smiling gleefully on my arrival 
at the hermitage, oh, Lakshmana, I really breath my last. 
"Say Lakshmana, whether that pietistic Vaidehi is alive or not? Or, on your becoming unmindful of your 
guard is she consumed by demons, either? 
"She who is softish by her nature and youngish by her age has never noticed the despair of separation 
from me, and now by my dissociation she will be despairing brokenheartedly, so it seems. 
"That impostor and highly impudent demon Maareecha who shouted loudly as, 'oh, Lakshmana,' might have 
caused fear even in you in everyway. 
"I hope that Vaidehi has also heard that voice which is similar to that of mine, and I hope frightened 
as she is she might have also hastened you, and I hope you also have come to see me, that hastily! 
"In everyway you have caused hardship by leaving Seetha in isolation, and a leeway is given to the diabolical 
demons for a counterattack against us. 
"Raw-flesh eating demons are distraught as I have liquidated Khara, as a result those ghastly ones would 
have liquidated Seetha by now. There is no doubt about it. 
"In everyway I am sunken in scourge, but oh, enemy-eliminator Lakshmana, what I can possibly do in present 
situation? Perchance, this sort of scourge is liable to chance upon me, alas!" Thus Rama gave vent to 
his feelings on his way to hermitage. 
In this way while thinking emotively about that curvaceous Seetha, Raghava hurriedly returned to Janasthaana 
along with Lakshmana. 
He that Rama who chastened his younger brother en route is worried in aspect and wizened is his mouth 
by hunger, by strain, and also thus by thirst, and suspiring heavily he arrived near at hermitage, and 
became dispirited when he beheld the hermitage in vacuity. That valiant Rama on quickly entering his 
own hermitage found it to be vacuous. Then he rushed out and went round a place of pastime of Seetha, 
saying 'yes, this is that place where she used to move round for plucking flowers.' And again he dashed 
in to hermitage only to find it as an empty cottage. Then he rushed out to some other place of playtime 
of Seetha yelling, 'yes, this is that place where she used play with deer, squirrels and birds.' And 
again came back to vacant hermitage, and again he dashed to some other prayer-time place exclaiming, 
'yes, this is that very place where she offered her daily prayers.' Finally on returning to the vacant 
hermitage he became one who is plunged into hair-raising throes of despair as that cottage is emptied 
of Seetha. ouched with joy to hear the words rightly spoken by Hanuman, Rama replied as
follows: -
"A very outstanding work, the most arduous in the world has been done by Hanuman,
which could not be carried out even in thought by any other on the surface of this earth."
"Indeed, I cannot perceive as such anyone other than Garuda (chief of the feathered
race and vehicle of Lord Vishnu), wind- god and Hanuman, who can cross the mighty ocean."
"Who can return alive, having entered (once) taking refuge only in self- command,
the city of Lanka, which is unconquerable by gods demons and Yakshas and even by Gandharvas, Nagas
and ogres and well under the custody of Ravana?"
"Who is able to capture that citadel, by assault, that is exceedingly dangerous to
be attacked and which is powerfully guarded by ogres, but one whose courage and valour are equal to
Hanuman's?"
"A great act of service has been done by Hanuman to Sugriva thus by exhibiting his
strength corresponding to his pace."
"That servant to whom his master entrusts a difficult task and who performs it with
zeal is said to be a superior person."
"The one who is ready and capable but who yet does no more than his master extracts
from him is called a mediocre person."
"The one who is well and able and yet does not carry out the instructions of his
master as directed is said to be the least of men ."
"Through the discovery of Sita's retreat by this faithful messenger, Hanuman has
fulfilled the task entrusted to him unfalteringly to the satisfaction of Sugriva and hence there
was no diminution to his self."
"By finding out Sita, the Raghu dynasty as well as myself and the valiant Lakshmana
too, have been rightly saved today."
"But it squeezes my conscience further, hopeless as I am, to think that I am not
able to do a pleasant act befittingly to the bearer of these good tidings."
"Let me at least embrace this magnanimous Hanuman since in the present
circumstances, this is all that is easily obtained from me."
Thus saying, Rama vibrating with joy, clasped Hanuman in his arms who, master of
himself, his mission fulfilled, had returned.
After reflecting a while, Rama the great scion of Raghus, again spoke as follows,
Sugriva the ruler of monkeys too listening attentively.
"The search for Sita has been performed so much well in all ways. But my mind gets
dejected once more, when I behold this vast ocean."
How can these monkeys put together will reach the southern bank of the ocean, which
is so difficult to cross and which contains voluminous water?"
"Having received the tidings of Sita, what can now be done to take the monkeys to
the farther side the sea?"
Thus speaking to Hanuman, Rama the destroyer of enemies and the mighty armed, was
filled with apprehension and then became absorbed in thought.The readers familiar with the critical edition may find only twenty-three verses in that edition, whereas this traditional version contains forty-eight of them. Twenty-five verses that account for the names of trees, river-flows, the beauty of nature, etc., extolling nature are here as an ingredient of epical literature that aims to remind us about the need for a good environment, rather than to worry about global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation, etc.

Rama along with his brother Lakshmana reached Mt. Prasavana while the enthsroned Sugreeva entered the cave-city Kishkindha.

Mt. Prasavana is pervaded with noisily growling tigers and beasts, mightily roaring lions, compacted with diverse shrubs and creeper-plants, overspread with many a kind of tree, thus it is adored by bears, monkeys, baboons, and even by wildcats, and that mountain which is always sanctifying and tranquil is like a heap of clouds in its shine.

Rama along with Lakshmana has taken up an ample spaced cave as residence on the cliff of that mountain.

Rama, the faultless one and the elder brother of Lakshmana, who is the delight of Raghu's dynasty, and who made an accord with Sugreeva regarding the cessation of activity during the rainy season, spoke these significant and timely words to his humble brother Lakshmana who is the enhancer of prosperity.

"This delightful mountain cave is spacious and breezy, hence, oh, enemy destroyer Soumitri, let us stay in this during rainy nights.

"This admirable peak of the mountain is embellished with white, black, and coppery rock faces, oh, prince, thus this is fully overspread with diverse ores. Bristling with rivers and frogs, and brimmed with clumps of various trees along with beautiful and amazing creeper-plants it is elaborated. It is highly reverberated with diverse birds and filled with the screeches of the best peacocks. And bloomed Maalati and Jasmine bushes, also trees like Sindhuvara, and Shirrishika, further trees like Kadamba, Arjuna, and Sarja in bloom, are brightening it and it is delightful.

"This pleasant lake of lotuses enwreathed with its blossomy lotuses, oh, prince, is available not far away from our cave.

"This cave with its northeasterly slope will be homely for us since the inrush of rainwater will be a less, oh, gentle one, also thus with its upraised westerly portion this cave will be less of gusts that come from the east.

"The black stone available at the doorway of the cave that looks like a spattered mound of mascara is broad, even-surfaced, and will be pleasant for a repose.

"See this mountain peak that looks like a scattered mound of mascara, dear boy, which rose like a black cloud in the sky, and it is auspicious for it is on the northern side.

"Even see this mountain available in the southerly direction as if a white cloth is spread on the sky, which is vying with Mt. Kailash and abounding with many an ore.

"Also see this river unusually sludge-less, flowing from the side of the cave and streaming eastward, spruced up with trees like Sandalwood, Tilaka, Saala, Tamaala, Atimukta, Padmaka, Sarala, and even with Ashoka trees, and it looks as if River Ganga is flowing in Trikuta.

"With the trees born on the riverbank and available here and there in various shapes, like Vaaniira, Timida, Vakula, Ketaka, and with Hintaala, Tinisha, Niipa, Vetasa, Kritamaala trees, that river is brightened up, and thus that river appears as a dame finely bedecked with clothing and ornaments.

"This river is fairly resonated with the calls of diverse birds in hundreds of flights, beautified with ruddy gees that are doting one upon the other, and admired by the swans and cranes upon her highly appealing sand-isles, thus she appears to be a damsel decorated with jewels with a toothy grin.

"Somewhere overspread with blue water-lilies, elsewhere with red water-lilies she is shining forth, and she is also shimmering with the beautiful buds of white water-lilies, somewhere else.

"With hundreds of waterfowls cherishing it, screeches of peacocks and cackles of curlews reverberating around, assemblages of sages bustling about, this gracious river is heart-pleasing.

"As if seeded by the wish of some divine creativity the rows of sandalwood trees that are virtually captivating have sprung forth uniformly, so also, the rows of Arjuna trees too appear in a similar pattern.

"Aha! Soumitri, very exhilarating is this locale and we can happily reside here, oh, enemy-eliminator, we can certainly take delight in this environment.

"Further, oh, prince, hedged in charming groves that exquisite Kishkindha, the city of Sugreeva, will not be very far off from here.

"The melodies of singing and the tunes of musical instruments played and sung in Kishkindha are heard from here, oh, the best-triumphant Lakshmana and even the blares of vanara-s together with their snobbish drumming is heard, hence it is not far away.

"The best monkey Sugreeva must be surrounded by his friends, thus he must be exuberant, as he won the utmost prosperity in winning back his wife and winning the kingdom." Rama thus spoke to Lakshmana.

Raghava having said this resided on Mt. Prasavana along with Lakshmana, where many sightly caves and arbours are there.

Though that mountain is indeed very comfortable, though it possesses many objects of nature like flowers, fruits, and water, indeed, there is no slightest bliss to Rama while he resided there.

He felt despondent in reminiscing about his wife who is loftier than his life, but who is kidnapped, especially on seeing the moon just risen on the eastern mountain.

That anguish which is surging high in him has rendered him with a bosom marred with tears, thereby sleep does not affect him even if he has gone to bed at night.

While pacifying Rama who is pensive and who is always subjected to grief, his brother Lakshmana who is similarly sad for his brother's sadness spoke these words.

"Oh, brave one, enough is this anguishing of yours, and it will be inapt of you to dishearten. All objectives will backslide for them who will be ceaselessly anguishing. That you know clearly.

"Oh, Raghava, in the world you are a result-oriented person, and a devotee of gods for achieving those desired results, you are the theist, moralist, and also the mobilizer.

"You are the only master in all the worlds to undertake certain tasks, and for achieving results of those human actions of yours you worship god, leaving the fruits of your action in god... you will do your duty as ordained... you are a theist, for you alone are 'that' 'SupremeThereafter Rama, the annihilator of enemies, spreading sacred grass on the sea
shore, making a respectful salutation (by joining his palms) to the great ocean with his face
turned eastward, lied down with his arm, resembling the body of a snake , as his pillow.
His arm formerly adorned with armlets of gems and gold and the most excellent jewels
of pearls, was touched more than once, by excellent women ( Kausalya and other mothers or by royal
maids).
Formerly, his arm used to be tended with sandalwood and aloe and with saffron pastes
and made beautiful like the splendor of a rising sun.
In the past, the aforesaid arm was graced by the head of Seetha on the couch. It
resembled the body of Takshaka. (A snake) supported on the water of the Ganga.
The aforesaid arm resembled a yoke. It enhanced the grief of his enemies in battle.
It was delightful to his friends. It is now placed at the shore of the sea.
The aforesaid arm whose skin had been hardened by the strokes of the bow string, off
the left arm resembling a great mace and that mighty right arm that bestowed thousands of cows in
charity was used as a pillow. Rama, the competent man and the mighty armed said: " Either crossing
of the ocean or a death should occur to me today". Making that resolve he laid down by the ocean,
restraining his speech and with a pious disposition according to tradition.
Following the scriptural injunction, that Rama who was devoted to his sacred vow,
while sleeping on the ground spread with Kusha grass, spent a time of three nights there.
Remaining there for three nights, Rama who was skilled in policy and fond of piety,
waited upon the ocean, the lord of rivers.
Though honored according to his worth by the self subdued Rama, the careless ocean
did not appear in his personal form to Rama.
Rama becoming angry with the ocean, having the outer corners of his eyes turned red,
spoke those words to Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, who was in his vicinity:
"O, what arrogance of the ocean, who does not appear himself personally before me!
Indeed calmness, forbearance kind spoken ness and straight -forwardness- these qualities of noble
men give weak results, when directed towards those having no virtues."
"This world honors that man, who boasts himself, is corrupt and shameless, runs
about in all directions advertising himself and commits every kind of excess"
"O, Lakshmana! In this world, it is not possible to obtain fame, glory or victory at
the end of a battle, by conciliation"
"O, Lakshmana! Behold now this ocean, having its water made suffocated soon with its
crocodiles floated on all sides and broken asunder by my arrows".
"See here, O, Lakshmana, the coils of water snakes, the huge bodies of alligators
and the trunks of sea elephants being shattered by me."
"I will make the ocean with its multitude of conches, oyster shells, fishes and
crocodiles, dry up now in this great battle"
"This ocean is considering me as an incapable man endowed as I am with forbearance.
It is a great mistake to show forbearance to such an individual."
"The Ocean is not appearing himself before me on kind words. O, Lakshmana! Bring the
bow and the serpentine arrows. I shall dry up this ocean, so that our monkeys can cross it by
feet."
"Being provoked now, I will shake this ocean, even if it is unshakable. I will force
the ocean, which is demarcated by banks and agitated with thousands of waves, bereft of a boundary,
by my arrows. I will agitate the great ocean, thronged with great demons."
Speaking as aforesaid, Rama with his eyes made larger by anger and wielding a bow
with his hand, became dreadful to look at, as a blazing fire at the end of the world.
Swaying his terrific bow and making the earth tremble by his violence Rama released
the arrow resembling a powerful thunderbolt of Indra. (god of celestials).
Those excellent arrows having a great speed and ablaze by their splendor, penetrated
the waters of the ocean, striking the water- snakes with terror.
The great jerk of water with fishes and alligators of the ocean, together with the
resonance of the wind became very much dreadful.
Immediately that great ocean, became shaken by the cluster of huge waves enveloped
by a multitude of conches in its rolling waves and a smoke came out.
Sea-snakes having brilliant faces and glittering eyes and the very valiant demons
residing in nethermost subterranean region of the sea, were perturbed.
Thousands of waves, so large resembling Vindhya and Mandhara mountains, jumped up
from the sea with its crocodiles and sea monsters.
That ocean with its multitude of fluctuating waves, with its frightened serpents and
demons, with huge crocodiles coming out, became full of noise.
Then Lakshmana rushed towards Rama who in a terrific velocity was stretching his
incomparable bow, with a penetrating sigh, crying: "No further, no farther" and took hold of the
bow.
"O, honorable man! Even without the destruction of the ocean, the purpose of you the
greatest hero will be fulfilled. Men like you do not fall into the sway of anger. You see some
durable and noble alternative"
Brahmana-sages and celestial sages, stationed in the interior of the sky cried in a
loud voices, saying "No farther, no farther" and making a noise "Ah,Oh,Alas!"Having traveled the extensive and beautiful Kosala territory and standing with his face turned towards Ayodhya, the wise Rama with joined palms spoke the following words: "I bid farewell to you, Oh best of the cities, carefully protected by Dasaratha born in Kakutstha dynasty, as well as of the deities who protect you and dwell in you."
"After getting relieved from exile in the forest and thus freed from the debt to the emperor, I shall see you again, duly getting united with my mother and father."
Lifting his right arm and wearing a woeful look, his face covered with tears, Rama possessing lovely reddish eyes, spoke them to the people hailing from the countryside.(as follows) :
"Mercy and compassion according to my worth (in your view) have been shown to me byyou. Keeping agony for a long time is undesirable. Let each return to accomplish your desired object(attending to your house-hold work)!"
Respectfully saluting the high soled prince and going round him clockwise (as a mark of reverence), those men stood rooted here and there, wailing frightfully.
While they were lamenting thus unceasingly, Rama passed beyond their sight, as the sun sinks out of view at nightfall.
Then Rama, a tiger among men, in his chariot, crossed Kosala territory, which was
rich in grain and treasure, inhabited by men given to charity, benevolent and free from every danger, pleasing, full of temples and sacrificial stakes, adorned with gardens and mango-orchards, intersected by ponds full of water, populated by contented and well nourished people, abounded in herds of cows which deserved to be seen by all kings and which re-echoed to the chanting of religious texts.
Rama, the best among the resolute, moved into the middle of a happy and prosperous kingdom, abounding in lovely gardens and fit to be enjoyed by kings.
There, Rama beheld the celestial and lovely river of Ganga with its tree
tributaries, carrying clear waters without green moss and frequented by sages.
The River Ganga was adorned with splendid hermitages within easy distance from one another, with pools overflowing with water, visited at suitable hours by celestial nymphs thrilling with rapture.
The blessed river was graced by gods and demons, Gandharvas(celestial musicians) and kinnaras and was constantly visited by consorts of Nagas and Gandharvas.
The well known river was hemmed in by hills serving as the play- ground of hundreds of celestials and embellished with hundreds of celestial gardens; it coursed through the heavens for the benefit of gods and which in heaven was named "The stream of Golden Lotuses".
The holy river, the sound of whose clashing waves and its striking with rocks
resembled a deep laughter, having a bright smile as white as a foam, its waters reduced at some places to the shape of a maiden's plaited locks, was rendered beautiful at some places by whirl pools.
At some places, its waters were still and deep. At some places, they were disturbed with violent agitation. At some places, they made a deep roaring sound. At some places, they were having a terrific noise Hosts of gods took a dip into its water .It was adorned by white lotuses. It was hemmed in, with expanse of small islands and at some places, lined with white sands.
The river was rendered resonant by swans and cranes, was graced with cackling of
Chakrawaka** birds and other birds which are in rut all through the year kept hovering on its water.
At some places the river was adorned with trees growing on its banks encircling like garlands, at some places crowded with thick cluster of lotuses.
At some places, it was graced with beds of water lilies in the form of buds and at some places, it was reddened with the pollen of numerous flowers, as though excited with passion.
Having every aggregation of dirt removed, the river presented a spotlessly clear
appearance like a crystal. The interior of the forest was reddened noisy again and again by the elephants guarding the quarters, by the ruttiest wild elephants and the elephants of excellent breed used for riding by gods.
Surrounded by fruits and flowers and tender leaves, shrubs and birds, it looked like a young woman artistically decked with the best of jewels. The river was infested with dolphins, crocodiles and snakes.
Rama, the mighty armed, reached the river Ganga, which is devoid of sins and which dispels all sins, which had fallen from the mass of matted hair of Lord Shankara through the spiritual power of Emperor Bhagiratha, which is rendered noisy by cranes and herons, which is a consort of the ocean and which is in the vicinity of Sringaverapura(the modern Singraur).
Beholding the river Ganga with its waves covering whirlpools, Rama the great warrior said to Sumantra the charioteer as follows: "We shall halt here itself today."
"Oh, charioteer! Not far from the river stands this very large sacred fig tree with its many flowers and shoots. We shall stay here itself."
"I shall see (from here) the excellent river Ganga, which is auspicious and whose
waters deserve to be respected by gods, men, Gandharvas, beasts, reptiles and birds ."
Saying so be it' and nothing more to Rama, Lakshmana and Sumantra too then directed the horses to that sacred fig tree.
Rama, the delight of Ikshvaku dynasty, reached that beautiful tree and got down from the chariot along with Sita and Lakshmana.
Sumantra too dismounted from the chariot, unyoked the superb horses after which with joined palms, he seated himself near Rama at the foot of the tree.
There, a king named Guha was Rama's friend dear to him as his own life. He was
Nishada by birth, a strong man and well known as a ruler of Nishadas.
Hearing of Rama the tiger among men having come to his territory, he approached the prince, escorted by elderly ministers and relatives.
Seeing from a distance the king of Nishada coming, Rama along with Lakshmana
thereupon went forth to meet Guha.
Closely embracing Rama, Guha who felt disturbed, spoke to him, "This city too is as much as Ayodhya to you. What can I do for you? Oh mighty armed! Who indeed will get such a lovely guest?"
Having brought pristine cooked rice of excellent quality and other dishes of various kinds, he then quickly offered him water to wash his hands and spoke as follows: "Welcome to you, Oh, mighty armed! All this land is yours. We are your servants. You are the Lord. Rule over our kingdom in an efficient way."
"Here have arrived various kinds of dishes, drinks and syrups as also excellent beds (for you to sleep on) and food for your horses"
To Guha who was speaking as aforesaid, Rama replied thus: "We stand honored by you, by your very visit to us on foot, as well as your show of affection and are pleased with you"
Pressing gently with his muscular arms, Rama spoke these words: " Oh, Guha! Thank
heaven that I am seeing you in good health with your relatives. Is all well with the kingdom, the allies and the treasure?"
"I know your affection by which all this is extensively well arranged by you. But I am not in a position indeed to accept it."
"Know me as under a vow to be an ascetic, wearing the robes of bark and deerskin and by piety, I am determined to live in the forest by eating roots and fruits only."
"I desire nothing but a little forage for the horses. By being provided with this
much at the present moment, I shall be duly satisfied by you."
"These horses were cherished by the king Dasaratha, my father. I shall feel honored by these horses being duly fed."
Then Guha on that spot commanded his men as follows: "Let water for drinking and
forage be supplied promptly to horses"
Having worshipped the evening twilight appearing in the west, with an upper garment made of bark(on his person); Rama then took for food only water brought by Lakshmana himself.
Having washed the feet of Rama who was lying on the ground along with his consort, Lakshmana then came and stood near a tree.
Guha too along with the charioteer conversed with Lakshmana and thereafter wielding a bow; alertly kept a vigil over Rama.
The illustrious, lofty minded and the high-soled son of Dasaratha, who had never
seen suffering and who deserved all comforts, remained lying on the ground thereafter, while that long night passed away.On listening to the words of Janaka, the eminent-saint Vishvamitra indeed said to
  the king Janaka thus as, "let the bow be displayed to Rama..." 
Then king Janaka indeed ordered his ministers, "bring the divine bow which is
  decorated with sandalwood paste and garlands... 
Thus clearly instructed by Janaka those high souled ministers have gone out from
  there and entered the palace-chambers, and they came out with an eight-wheeled coffer in which
  the bow of Shiva is ensconced, and those ministers got it tugged by five thousand tall men of
  illimitable energy who somehow tugged it very difficultly, and thus the ministers have re-entered
  there keeping that bow afore of them. 
On fetching that iron coffer wherein that bow is there, those ministers of the
  king have reported to their godlike King Janaka. 
Oh king and sovereign of Mithila, here is the select bow that is reverenced by
  all kings, oh, best king, which you wished to be evincible to the boys, to evince their
  capabilities... 
On listening the announcement of his ministers the king spoke to the noble souled
  Vishvamitra and to both Rama and Lakshmana too duly making palm-fold. 
Here is that exquisite bow, oh, Brahman, which is held as a time-honoured bow by
  the lineage of Janaka kings, and with which even the highly forceful kings are rendered
  inefficient to take aim with it, previously... 
None in all the assemblages of gods, inclusive of demigods, demons, gandharva-s,
  yaksha-s, kinnaraa-s, or reptilian demigods, is capable enough to take aim with this bow and all
  are rendered incapable... and then, in brandishing this bow for a proper grip, or in bracing its
  bowstring to the other end, or in twitching the bowstring for its tautness, or in placing the
  arrow on bowstring at a proper place for a proper stretchability, or even in taking a good aim
  with it... what will be that capability of one from among humans... 
"Oh, eminent-saint, such as it is, this nonpareil bow among all bows is brought
  in, and oh, highly fortunate sage Vishvamitra, let this be displayed to those two princes..."
  Thus Janaka said to Vishvamitra. 
Vishvamitra on listening the sentence of Janaka along with Rama, on his part said
  to Raghava, "oh, boy Rama... you may see the bow..." 
Upon the word of the great sage Vishvamitra, Rama on unclosing the lid of that
  strongbox, wherein that bow is ensconced, saw the bow and said. 
Now I wish to get the feel of this supreme bow, oh, Brahman, and I shall try to
  brandish it, or even try to take aim with it... 
"All Right!" said the saint and king to Rama in chorus, and Rama upon the word of
  the sage grasping it at the middle handgrip playfully grabbed the bow. 
While many thousands of men are witnessing that right-minded Rama the legatee of
  Raghu stringed the bow effortlessly. 
Further, that dextrous one has stringed that bow with bowstring and started to
  stretch it up to his ear to examine its tautness, but that glorious one who is foremost among
  men, Rama, broke that bow medially. 
Then there bechanced an explosive explosion when the bow is broken, like the
  explosiveness of down plunging thunder, and the earth is tremulously tremulous, as it happens
  when a mountain is exploding. 
Bewildered by that raucous caused by the breakage of bow, all the people swooned,
  except for that eminent-saint Vishvamitra, king Janaka, and those two Raghava-s, namely Rama and
  Lakshmana. 
While the people are being reaccustomed after their undergoing the shock, at that
  moment that sententious king Janaka, whose discomfiture has completely departed by now has said
  this to the eminent-saint Vishvamitra with a reverent palm-fold. 
Oh, godly sage, the gallantry of Dasharatha's Rama is evidently seen... and the
  whys of this boy and wherefores of his stringing that massive bow are unimaginable to me! More
  so, humans lifting it! How so? This is an unhoped-for incident for me, besides, breaking it! This
  a is highly wondrous experience for me... 
My daughter Seetha on getting Dasharatha's Rama as her husband, she will bring
  celebrity to the lineage of Janaka-s... 
Oh, Kaushika, my commitment that she is the bounty of bravery has also come
  true... and my daughter Seetha who is nurtured well than my own lives is a worthy bride for
  Rama... 
Should you give consent, oh, Brahman, my ministers will be hastened to speedily
  go to Ayodhya in chariots, oh, Kaushika, let safeness betide you, and one and all by this
  matrimony... 
With their observant submissions those ministers will narrate in detail about the
  sincere endowment of Seetha as bravery's bounty to Rama, and they will lead king Dasharatha into
  my city that observantly... 
"Those ministers will also tell the king Dasharatha that both the Kakutstha-s,
  Rama and Lakshmana, are under the aegis of saint Vishvamitra, and thus gladdening that king they
  will expeditiously usher in king Dasharatha for marriage..." So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.
  
Vishvamitra said, "so be it," and then that right-minded king Janaka on consulting
  with his ministers started to send his ministers, plenipotentiaries, to Ayodhya to inform
  Dasharatha in detail as to what has happened, and likewise to bring him to Mithila. Lakshmana became dejected and spoke these words, properly befitting for that time, to that Rama's mother Kausalya who was thus weeping.
"Oh, the honoured lady ! I also do not like Rama to be influenced by the words of a woman and go to the forest, leaving the prosperous kingdom."
"The king with perverted mind, of old age, one who is outraged by sensual enjoyments and possessed of passion can talk any thing, prompted by Kaikeyi."
"I can not see any offence or cause for blame in Rama that can expel him from the state to the forest."
I have not seen in this world any person, whether an enemy or an expellee, speaking ill of Rama indirectly."
"Can anybody observing ethicalness, causelessly get rid of a son who is equal to god who is honest, who is self-restrained and who is affectionate even towards adversaries?"
"Which son, knowing royal usage, can agree to the words of this king who is behaving as though he got childhood again?"
"Even before others get to know about this matter, make this dominion your own, with my help."
"Oh, Rama! While I am standing by your side along with a bow, protecting you who are standing as God of Death, who is capable of doing too much ?"
"Oh, Rama, the best of men! If the city of Ayodhya turns against you, I shall make it desolate of men with sharp arrows"
"I shall kill all those who are siding Bharata ,and are favourable to him. Soft person indeed gets disgraced!"
"If our father with an evil mind behaves like our enemy with instigation by Kaikeyi. 
I shall keep him imprisoned with out personal attachment or if necessary, kill him."
"Even a venerable person is to be punished, if he becomes arrogant, if he does not know good and evil actions and if he takes to a wrong route."
"Oh, Rama, the best of men! On what strength or season has he taken shelter to give away this kingdom belonging to you to Kaikeyi?"
"Oh, Rama the chestiser of enemies! Where is the ability for him to give kingdom to Bharata, by making great enmity against you and me "
"Oh, queen! Really, I am devotedly attached to my brother Rama. I am swearing an oath to you by truth by bow, by the act of giving and by the act of sacrifice."
"Oh, queen! If Rama can enter blazing fire or forest, you make certain that even before, I can enter there"
"I shall alleviate your grief, by showing my valour like the rising sun alleviating darkness .Let Rama and yourself see my valour"
Hearing these words of Lakshmana the magnanimous, Kausalya entirely given up to anguish and weaping, spoke thus to Rama.
"Oh, son !You have heard the words of Lakshmana .If you agree, you do what is to be done, immediately."
"It is not proper for you to go away from here, leaving me afflicted with grief, after hearing the un-just words spoken by my co-wife."
"Oh, Rama! You are righteous man. If you desire to practice virtue, be a virtuous man and stay here serving me thereby practicing the best morality in the form of serving your mother.
"Oh, son! Formerly Kasyapa was staying in his own house itself with self restraint, performed great austerity by serving his mother and went to heaven"
"Just as the king, by respectable feeling to you is worthy of worship, so also being your mother, I am worthy of worship to you. Hence, do not go to the forest"
"After your separation, I shall have no use of this life or comforts for me, it is good even to eat grass while staying with you"
"I shall not live if you leave for the forest, leaving me who is afflicted with grief. 
I shall seek death through starvation"
"Oh, son! If I fast myself to death for your sake, you will attain the universally famous hell, like the god of the ocean obtaining trouble because of his un justice behaviour, towards the sage called Pippalada, producing the latter's wrath."
The honest Rama spoke these virtuous words to his mother Kausalya, who was thus weeping miserably.
"I am not able to violate my father's words. I am bowing my head and asking your favour. I shall have to go to the forest"
"A sage called Kandu, who knew righteousness, who performed religious vows and who was a learned man, killed even a cow, acting as per his father's words"
"Previously, the sons of Sagara belonging to our race, were got bitterly digging up the earth, as commanded by their father."
"Parasu Rama, the son of Jamadagni personally slayed his mother Renuka in the forest with an axe as per his father's words."
"Oh, mother! These and many others who were equivalent to gods, did not make their father's words to go waste. I shall also do what is desired by my father"
"Oh, mother! I am not the only person to act according to father's command. Those I have mentioned to you hitherto also complied with their father's command."
"I am not setting any new contradicting customary conduct for your sake. I am adhering to the way agreed and followed by the ancient."
"I cannot do otherwise than acting in accordance with father's words, the prevalent practice on earth. There is no deprivation indeed for anyone who complies with father's commands."
Rama, the best of those who speak skilfully and the best of all those wearing the bow, spoke thus to his mother and turned round to Lakshmana to speak.
"Oh, Lakshmana ! I know your highest affection towards me, your heroic valour ,your strength and your unassailable splendour ."
" Oh, Lakshmana, with good attributes! My mother is feeling a great and unequalled sorrow, by not knowing the secret of truth and tranquillity."
"Righteousness is the best of all qualities in the world. Truth is established in righteousness. 
Even these best words of father are enjoined with righteousness."
"One who follows righteousness, does not waste his promise given to one's father or mother or Brahmana."
" I cannot transgress my father's command. On the word given by my father only, Kaikeyi instigated me to go to the forest."
"Hence, leave this mean mentality of military heroism. Observe righteousness and not rudeness. follow my perception."
Rama spoke thus to his brother affectionately, bowed to his mother and with folded hands, spoke again to Kausalya as follows.
"OH, mother! I have decided to go to forest. Please give me permission. I am swearing to you on my life. Please invoke blessings on me."
"As sage king named Yayati in olden times left the heaven and reached back heaven again, I shall be back to the city from the forest, after fulfilling my promise."
"Oh, mother! Please do not grieve, Bear it well in your heart. I shall come back here again from the forest after fulfilling the father's command."
"You and I, Sita, Lakshmana, Sumintra and all of us should follow father's directions. This is an eternal custom."
"Oh mother! Please approve my righteous intention of going to the forest, duly withdrawing preparations for my coronation and keeping in check the sorrow in your heart."
The mother Kausalya heard the most virtuous, cool and steady words of Rama and rose, as though regained consciousness once more after death, looked at Rama and spoke thus again.
"Oh, son! I am also as respectable a person to you as your father, in my own right and due to great affection. I do not give permission to you. You cannot thus go away, leaving me in great sorrow."
"What is the use of my living in this world without you? What is the use of the other world or the oblation of food offered to the deceased ancestors or the nectar of immortality? Your proximity even for a moment is better than that of the entire world of living beings."
After hearing the pathetic lamentation of his mother, he was highly anguished, as when an elephant is removed highly from its way by men with flames of fire.
Rama, who was established in righteousness, spoke these words endowed with virtue, to his mother who was looking unconscious and to Lakshmana who was disturbed and exhausted with distress. 
He was the only person worthy of speaking thus at that time.
"Oh, Lakshmana! I always know your devotion towards me as well as your strength. But now, you are joining with mother in afflicting much trouble to me without looking at my opinion."
"Oh, Lakshmana! In obtaining the fruit of good works in the world, righteousness utility and free will are being considered. As a wife who is obedient, who is beloved and who is having good sons, good work yields all these three things."
"Only such an action, which is righteous, is to be initiated, leaving that in which wealth, desire and righteousness do not come together. One who is intested in wealth alone becomes indeed fit to be hated in the world. So also the one whose very essence is desire, cannot indeed be considered 
good.
"When father, who is venerable, a king and old-aged, commands an action either by anger or by extreme joy or by even desire, which right person will not perform it? Only a person who chooses to be cruel will not do it."
"I cannot avoid fulfilling the father's command completely. For both of us, he is an important person indeed to command us. To mother Kausalya also, he is the husband, the resource person and the personified law."
"while the righteous king Dasaratha is alive and especially when he is following his own righteous path, how the mother Kausalya can go out with me from here leaving the city like other widowed woman?"
"Oh, mother the queen! Permit me to go to forest. As Yayati returned to heaven by the power of truth, give me your power of blessings so that I can return here after completion of exile."
"I cannot keep back reputation and glory for the sake of kingdom alone. This cannot unrighteously long for this inferior kingdom."
Rama, the best of men, decided to go to Dandaka forest fearlessly with his prowess, consoled his mother, advised his brother by good thoughts and made hearty circumbulatory salutation to his mother.Thereafter, the lotus-eyes Rama, who was dark-brown in complexion and great beyond compare, spoke thus to the charioteer, "Tell about me to my father."
Quickly entering inside, when sent by Rama, the charioteer saw the king having
sighs, his senses disturbed by grief.
He saw the king resembling an eclipsed sun, like fire covered by ash, as a lake
without water.
The charioteer, a great intellectual, saw Dasaratha repenting with his mind greatly agitated and approached him with joined palms.
The charioteer, first inspiring the king with blessings of triumph, spoke thus in a slow and sweet voice, overcome with fear.
"Your son, the tiger among men, having given away all his wealth to brahmanas and
dependents, is waiting at the gate."
"May auspiciousness betide you! Let that Rama, who is unfailingly brave, see you.
After bidding farewell to all friends, he wants to see you now."
"Oh, king! Rama is setting out to a great forest. See him who is resembling a sun
with rays of light, displaying royal qualities."
That king Dasaratha, who speaks truth, whose mind is virtuous, who is like an ocean by his depth of character and who is blemish less like a sky, replied to Sumantra as follows:"Oh, Sumantra! being all my wives, who are here. Surrounded by all of them, I want to see the virtuous Rama."
Sumantra, after entering the gynaecium, spoke these words to those women as follows: "Oh, the venerable ladies! The king is calling you. Go there without delay.
All those women, asked thus by Sumantra as per the king's orders, went to his
palace, after knowing the instructions of their husband.
Encircling Kausalya, three hundred fifty women, steadfast in their vow(of devotion to their husband), with their eyes reddened, went there slowly.
After arrival of his wives, king Dasaratha spoke to that charioteer as follows, "Oh, Sumantra! Bring my son here."
Taking Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, that charioteer then speedily went to the king'spresence.
King Dasaratha surrounded by women, seeing from a distance his son coming with
folded hands, distressed as he was, rose swiftly from his seat.
Seeing Rama, King Dasaratha ran speedily towards him. But without reaching him he
fell on the floor senseless, afflicted as he was with sorrow.
Then, Rama and Lakshmana an eminent car-warrior, quickly approached that king who
seemed unconscious with full of grief as he was, through agony.
Sounds of thousands of women crying "Alas! Alas! Oh Rama!" generated all at once
from the royal palace, mixed with the sound of tinkling ornaments.
Holding Dasaratha in their arms and crying, both Rama and Lakshmana along with
Seetha laid him on the couch.
Then, Rama with folded hands spoke thus to king Dasaratha who got consciousness
within a short time and who was inundated in a sea of sorrow.
"Oh, emperor! I take leave of you, who are the lord of all of us. See auspiciously towards me, who am about to leave for Dandaka forest."
"Permit Lakshmana also and Seetha too who is accompanying me to the forest. Even if prevented(by me0 on many true reasons, these two are not agreeing to stay behind"
"Giving up grief, Oh the bestower of honour, grant leave to all of us, Lakshmana
myself and Seetha as Brahma(the lord of creation) did to his sons(sanaka and his three brothers who intended to go to forest for practising austerities)."
Gazing at Rama who is unruffled, awaiting permission of the king for stay in the
forest, the king Dasaratha spoke thus: "Oh, Rama! I was stupefied by Kaikeyi through a boon. Now, by confining me, be you the king of Ayodhya."
When told thus by the king, Rama the best man in supporting righteousness and who is proficient in expression, replied( as follows) to his father, after making salutation with joined palms.
"Oh, king! You be the ruler of the earth for thousand years. But, I for my part,
will stay in the forest. For my sake, do not generate untruth about you."
"Oh, ruler of men! Having strolled in the forest for fourteen years, I shall clasp your feet once more after fulfilling my promise."
Prompted secretly by kaikeyi, the distressed king, tied up by fetters of truth, said weeping to that beloved son.
"Oh, darling! Proceed for welfare, for advancement and for coming again. Let your
path of travel be auspicious, undistracted and fearless from any quarter."
"Oh, darling, the seion of Raghu! Truthful as you are by nature and your mind being given to righteousness, your decision cannot be reversed."
"Oh, son! Do not leave in any case today, now at night time. Even by seeing you for one day, I may live happily."
"Looking at your mother and myself, stay at least for this night today. Satiated by all the desired objects, you may leave tomorrow at dawn."
"Oh Rama, my son! An incorrigible thing is being done by you since for my pleasure you are going to the forest a solitary place, leaving beloved ones."
"Oh Rama my son! Your exile is not agreeable to me. I was cheated by Kaikeyi who had concealed intentions and resembled fire with ashes."
Incited by Kaikeyi who has destroyed established customs, you wish to redeem my
deceit, derived by me from her.
"It is not a great surprise, my son, that you my eldest son should seek to make your father as one who does not have false promises."
After hearing these words of their father who was depressed, Rama and Lakshmana were upset. Then Rama spoke these words.
Even if these worldly pleasures are obtained today, who will offer those things to me tomorrow? Therefore I desire only to get away in lieu of all these enjoyments.
"This earth being relinquished by me; which included various provinces, filled with people, imbued with riches and food grains, may be given to Bharata."
"I cannot budge now from my decision made about my stay in the forest. Oh king the bestower of boons! You were pleased to give a boon to Kaikeyi and let it be fulfilled completely. Be you a truthful man."
"I , as promised, fulfilling your command, shall live in the forest along with
forest-dwellers for fourteen years."
"Oh, king! Do not have any hesitation in offering the kingdom to Bharata. Neither
kingdom nor happiness indeed is desired by my nature. It is dear to me only to do your command as directed."
"Let your sorrow disappear! Do not be overwhelmed with tears. The ocean, the lord of rivers which is difficult to assail, indeed does not get agitated."
"I do not crave for kingdom or happiness nor again for Seetha nor even all these
enjoyments nor for heaven nor even for life."
"Oh, Jewel among men! I wish you to be a truthful mean, not a fallacious man. I
swear to you in your presence by truth and by virtue."
"It is not possible for me, Oh father, to stay on even for a moment. Therefore,
contain this grief, Oh Lord, for there is no going back upon my word."
"Oh Dasaratha the seion of Raghu! I was indeed asked by Kaikeyi to go to the forest.
It was also replied by me that I would go. I shall redeem that pledge."
"Oh, king! Do not feel anxious. We shall sport in the forest, flocked with peaceful deer and rendered noisy by birds of various types."
"Oh, father! It was indeed said that even for celestials, father is the god.
Therefore, I shall carry out the father's word, considering it as divine."
"Oh father, the best among men! You will see me, when I come back after elapsing
fourteen years. Let this grief be given up."
"Oh, tiger among men! Why have you got perturbed-you by whom all these people bathed in tears, ought to be consoled?"
"Let this city, province and whole of this earth left by me, be given to Bharata. I for one following your instructions, shall proceed to the forest to dwell in it for long."
"Oh, king! Let this earth with multitude of mountains, comprising of cities with
their gardens relinquished by me, be ruled over barely by Bharata, within the bounds of righteousness. Let the word of honour given by you(to Kaikeyi) come true."
"Oh, the faultless king! My mind is not directed on haughty physical enjoyments or sensuous pleasures which is approved by the wise. Let your agony disappear, for my sake."
Oh, the sinless king! Therefore, now associating you with untruth, I just do not
desire for kingdom, nor all the sensual enjoyments, nor happiness nor existence nor even Seetha. Let your pledge(given to Kaikeyi) prove true."
"I shall be happy, entering the forest filled with wonderful trees, eating fruits
and tubers as well as seeing mountains rivers and lakes in the forest. Let there be satisfaction for you."
Embracing his son, that king Dasaratha, who had thus fallen on evil days, was
tormented with grief and distress, got fainted, fully losing his consciousness and not moving even a little.
Then, all the queens assembled there except Kaikeyi began to cry. Sumantra also fell into a swoon, while weeping. Everything there became loud lamenting.Rama the tiger among men, revolving in his mind the command of his father, covered a long distance during the rest of the night.
While Rama was traveling with the same alacrity, that delightful night passed away.
Having worshipped the blissful morning twilight, he passed beyond the boundary of that country.
Seeing villages, whose outskirts have been tilled and the woodlands laden with
blossoms and hearing as follows the words of men dwelling together in the midst of the village, Rama proceeded apace in those excellent horses as though slowly (engrossed as he was in enjoying the sights).
"Woe unto the king Dasaratha who fell into the clutches of concupiscence. Alas!
Kaikeyi the cruel and the sinful one now is still engaged in a cruel game. She is sending to exile the prince Rama, the pious man, the great intellectual, the compassionate man and he who subdued the senses. That hot-tempered Kaikeyi is behaving in a rude manner, transgressing the bounds of propriety"
"How Sita the venerable woman, the daughter of Janaka, who was delighted always in homely comforts can now experience hardships in the forest?"
"What a surprise! The king Dasaratha, having no love for his son, now wants to
abandon Rama who is so beloved to the people and is even faultless."
Hearing these words of people residing in villages and hamlets, Rama the heroic
prince of Kosala crossed the boundaries of Kosala state.
Having crossed the river of auspicious waters called Vedashruti, Rama then stretched forth, facing the quarter occupied by Sage Agastya.
After traveling a pretty long time from there, Rama crossed the river Gomati having beautiful waters, whose banks were adorned with cows and which headed towards the sea.
Reaching the other bank of Gomati river with the help of the swift moving horses,
Rama crossed the river called Syandika which had resounded with howls of peacocks and swans.
The said Rama showed to Sita the land (of Kosala, the southern boundary of which was defined by Syandika river)given long ago by the king Manu to Ikshvaku and which was bounded by many territories.
The glorious Rama, the foremost among men, whose voice resembled the cackling of a swan in rut, addressed the charioteer with great affection, in the words "Oh, charioteer!" and spoke as follows :
"When, coming back and united with my mother and father, shall I roam hunting in the forest, bordering on Sarayu river and laden with blossoms?"
"I do not hanker much after hunting in the woodlands bordering on Sarayu river. In fact it is a delightful spot, made much of in the world by hosts of royal sages. Hunting in the forest is indeed for gratification of royal sages in this world. At times; the bow- men adopted it. But I do not long for it excessively."
Uttering in sweet voice to the charioteer on various topics dearer to him, Rama
advanced thus along that route.Thereafter, when the sages departed, Rama, reflecting again and again, found no
pleasure to remain in that place for many reasons.
"It is here that Bharata, my mother along with the inhabitants of the city visited me. That memory haunts me, who lament for them daily."
"The dry dung of horses and elephants of that high souled Bharata's encamped army
caused much spoliation (around here)."
"We shall, therefore, move elsewhere", pondering thus, Rama along with Seetha and
Lakshmana left that place.
On the way, after reaching the hermitage of a sage called Atri, the highly
celebrated Rama offered salutation to that sage. The venerable sage, Atri too received him as his own son.
Offering personally, abundant hospitality with full honours to Rama, the sage Atri rendered equal honour to Lakshmana and the highly blessed Seetha too.
Atri, who knew righteousness and who was interested in the welfare of all beings,
called his aged wife Anasuya who had just come there, she who was revered by all and addressed gently to her.
Atri excellent sage spoke to the illustrious Anasuya, rich in asceticism and who
lived a pious life, saying "You welcome Videha's daughter!" and thereafter introduced that virtuous female ascetic to Rama (as follows):
"O, Irreproachable Rama! When the earth was burnt up by drought without break for
ten years, this virtuous woman produced fruit and roots, caused the River Jahnavi to flow here, undergoing a rigid mortification enriched by pious observances, by whom the most severe asceticism was practised for ten thousand years and obstacles were done away with and by whom for the reason of a divine command, in a great hurry ten nights were reduced to one night.* This Anasuya, who has
bathed after completion of the voes, is like a mother to you."
"Let Seetha find refuge with that ascetic, who is revered by all the beings, famous as she is and though old is ever free from anger."
Saying "Be it so" to the aforesaid sage, who was speaking thus, Rama spoke to the
virtuous Seetha, the following excellent words:
"O, princess! You have heard what the sage has said. For your own good, approach the saintly Anasuya without delay."
Hearing these words of Rama, who is desirous of her welfare, Seetha the daughter of Mithila circumambulated around Anasuya, Atri's wife, who knows piety.
Seetha coolly and reverently paid homage to that fortunate Anasuya, a devoted and
virtuous wife, who was feeble, wrinkled, aged, with her hair turned grey due to old age, and whose frame constantly shook like a banana tree in a storm. Seetha introduced herself, by announcing her name to Anasuya.
Saluting the irreproachable ascetic the rejoiced Seetha with joined palms enquired about he well-being.
Then, comforting that celebrated Seetha, engaged in righteous acts, Anasuya
rejoicingly spoke as follows: "Luckily enough, you are attending to righteousness."
"O, Seetha the beautiful lady! Thank heaven! Leaving your relatives, honour and
prosperity, you are accompanying Rama, who is expelled into a forest."
"Highly fortunate worlds await those women, await those women, to whom their husband is dear no matter whether he lives in a city or in a forest; whether he is sinful or virtuous."
"To women of noble nature, the husband is the highest deity no mater whether he is ill-behaved or licentious or devoid of riches."
"O, Seetha! On a reflection, I perceive none who is a better friend than a husband, who protects his wife in all circumstances, like the imperishable fruit of one's austerities."
"Those evil women, whose hearts follow their passions and conduct themselves
dominating their husband, having no understanding of virtue and vice, do not follow him in the aforesaid manner."
"O, Seetha! Surely, those evil women, who get into an improper act of authority over their husbands reap infamy and decline in righteousness."
"Women, like you, on the other hand who are endowed with virtues, who look with
detachment on prosperity and adversity in this world, therefore dwell in heaven as those who performed meritorious deeds."
"Thus devoted to your lord, loyal to your husband, following established rules, you become an honest wife to your husband and obtain merit and renown."Rama the annihilator of enemies heard those harsh and deadly words but was
unruffled. He spoke these words to Kaikeyi.
"Let it be, as you said it. I shall fulfil the king's promise, go to the forest from here to reside there, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide."
"But I want to know why the king, the inviolable and the subduer of enemies, is not greeting me today as before."
"Oh, queen! you need not be indignant. I am telling before you that I shall go to
the forest, wearing rags and braided hair. Become delighted well."
"How can I not do faithfully an action dear to my father, as commanded by him as
well-wisher, venerable man, as person with right conduct and as king."
"My heart is burning indeed with one sorrowful feeling that king himself has not
informed me about Bharata's coronation."
"Without being asked, I myself would have gladly offered even Sita with kingdom,
even my life, loved ones and wealth."
"Being directed by king, who is my father himself, how much more should I tell that I can give everything to Bharata, duly obeying father's promise to fulfil your beloved desire."
"That is why, you console him. Why indeed the king is thus slowly shedding tears,
with eyes gazed upon the floor?"
"Let messengers go now itself on fleet horses to bring Bharata from maternal uncle's house as per orders of the king."
"Immediately, I shall go to live in forest of Dandaka for fourteen years, without
reflecting on whether my father's words are right or wrong."
Hearing Rama's words, Kaikeyi felt glad that he would certainly go and urged him to make haste at once.
"Let it be so. Messengers can go on horses having rapid speed, to bring back Bharata from his maternal uncle's house."
"But I think it is not quite appropriate for you who are enthusiastic to go to
forest, to delay further."
"It is nothing but shyness that the king is not able to speak to you. Oh Rama, the best of men! Do not worry about it."
"Oh, Rama! Your father will neither take his bath nor eat a meal until you leave the city for the forest immediately.
Hearing these words, the king saying "what a pity! How much misery!" was overwhelmed with sorrow, fainted and fell in that couch adorned with gold.
Rama lifted up the king and soon got hurried up to leave for the forest he was again instigated by Kaikeyi as a horse was hit by a whip.
Rama after hearing that vulgar woman's words, which were harsh and having consequence, was unruffled and spoke these words to Kaikeyi.
"Oh queen! I am not concerned with wealth. I want to receive the world hospitable.
Know me as equal to a sage, abiding in righteousness alone."
"If I have to do whatever action is dearer to my revered father, that action is just done in all respects even by renouncing life."
"There is not indeed anything of greater performance of duty than doing service to father or than doing what he commands."
"Even if our reverent father does not tell me, I shall reside in the forest, devoid of people, now for fourteen years as per your word."
" In the matter of coronation of Bharata, you told Dasaratha and not to me, even
though you had every authority to tell, me directly. By this, it is known that you have not seen any merit in me. It is certain!"
" Today itself, I shall go to the forest of Dandaka after bidding, farewell to my
mother and also after consoling Sita."
"While ruling the kingdom, see that Bharata serves our father well. It is indeed an age-old practice."
Dasaratha after hearing Rama's words was hurt very much with grief was unable to
talk and wept loudly.
That Rama, with great brilliance, came out, after duly offering obeisance to the
feet of his father who was fainted and also to the feet of that vulgar Kaikeyi.
Rama made circumambulatory salutation to his father as well as Kaikeyi, left that
palace and saw his friends.
Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, felt very angry with his eyes filled with tears and accompanied behind Rama.
Rama did a circum bulatory salutation around the auspicious materials collected for the propound coronation and having fixed his attention respectfully on them, moved away slowly.
As Rama was a pleasing personality, he was loved by all the people. The loss of
kingdom could not diminish such a great splendour of Rama as a night cannot diminish the splendour of the moon.
In that Rama, who was leaving the kingdom after having decided to go to the forest, there was no perturbation of mind in him like in an ascetic who is beyond worldly pain and pleasure.
Rama, the man of great courage, refused fans and umbrella, sent away his friends,
chariot and citizens kept back sorrow in his mind, subdued his senses and entered his mother's house to inform the unpleasant news.
The people adjacent to Rama could not visualise any change in the face of Rama who was dignified and truthful in his words.
Rama did not lose his natural joy, as an autumnal moon with lofty rays does not lose its natural splendour.
Rama with his courageous spirit and of great fame, paying his respects to the people with his sweet words, went nearer to his mother.
Lakshmana, who got virtues equal to Rama, who was having great heroic valour and who was the brother, kept the grief within himself and went along with Rama.
When Rama entered, Kausalya's palace was filled with great joy. At that time, Rama did not show any displeasure for the mihlap occurred in truth. He behaved like that because he had doubted about the possible shock to his friends even of fear of their life, if he showed any perturabation.Rama, who was followed by Lakshmana, having made up his mind to ascend Mount Suvela, 
spoke in a gentle and prime voice to Sugreeva and to Vibhishana who was the knower of what is right, 
a demon devoted to him who was experienced in counsel and a knower of prescribed rules (as follows):
"We shall ascend up on high this Suvela mountain, shining well with hundreds of minerals. 
All of us will stay on this mountain for this night."
"We shall see Lanka the abode of that demon, Ravana the evil-minded by whom my wife was 
taken away for the sake of his own death, by whom virtue was not understood, good character was not 
known and noble lineage was not seen and by whom that contemptible act was done with an inferior demoniacal 
mind."
"My anger is increased on hearing the name of that demon. Because of the offence committed 
by him, I shall see that all these demons are destroyed."
"Falling into that power of trap of death, one does an evil act. Because of the offence 
committed by him the vilest, his lineage is destroyed."
Rama, thus thinking of Ravana in anger, approached and ascended the mountain of Suvela 
with its conspicuous summits.
Lakshamana too who took delight in his own valour and steadfastness, keeping ready his 
mighty bow with arrows, followed behind Rama Sugreeva along with his ministers and Vibhishana ascended 
the mountain, by following him.
Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Mainda, Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, 
Panasa, Kumuda, Hara, Rambha the chief of the troop, Jambavan, sushena, the greatly wise Rishabha, Durmukha 
of great splendour, Shatabali the monkey and other hundreds of monkeys which are fast-moving, which 
can wander easily on mountains with a speed akin to that of wind, ascended that Suvela mountain which 
Rama ascended.
Having ascended the mountain from all sides within no long time, they saw at its apex, 
the city of Lanka which appeared as though it was hanging in the sky.
The chiefs of monkey-troops saw that beautiful City of Lanka, furnished with excellent 
gates, enriched with exquisitc ramparts and pervaded all over with demons.
Those excellent monkeys saw another rampart formed out of the black demons so standing 
together scribble on that existing exquisite rampart.
Seeing the demons who were craving for war, all those monkeys made various types of noises, 
while Rama was witnessing the scene.
Then, the sun reddened with evening-twillight went down and the night shining with full 
moon arrived.
Thereafter, Rama along with Lakshmana as well as Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys together 
with troops and captions of troops, duly greeted welcomingly and treated hospitably by Vibhishana, halted 
happily on the mountain resort of Suvela.That king, who was dejected and very much distressed, having entered the
ssembly-hall, sat on his pre-eminent seat, snorting like a lion.
That mighty Ravana, who was emaciated for his son's death, having joined both his
palms in salutation, spoke the following words all those chiefs of army:
"Surrounded by the entire elephants and horses, as also graced with columns of
chariots and foot-soldiers, all of you march forward."
"Encircling Rama alone, you have to kill him, by showering streams of arrows upon
him, even as clouds pour showers during the rainy season."
"Or I shall kill Rama, while the world is witnessing it tomorrow, once his limbs are
torn by you with your sharp arrows in the great battle."
Having heard those words of Ravana, those demons sallied forth for the battle, along
with various kinds of armies and speedy chariots.
All those demons hurled iron clubs, sharp-edged spikes, arrows, swords and axes
capable of destroying the life. The monkeys too hurled trees and mountains towards the demons.
Towards sun-rise, that very terrific battle became tumultuous between demons and
monkeys.
Those monkeys and demons then began to strike each other with multi-coloured maces,
darts, swords and axes in the battle.
While the battle was thus in progress, the surprisingly enormous dust was actually
settled down by the streams of blood, proceeding from the demons and mokeys.
With elephants and chariots as their river-banks, with horses as their fish and with
flag-staffs as trees, rivers of blood gushed forth, carrying dead
Then, all those monkeys were drenched in streams of blood. Leaping and bouncing on
the battle-field, the monkey-chiefs broke off flag-staffs, armours, chariots, horses and various
kinds of weapons.
With their sharp teeth and nails, the monkeys tore off the hair, ears, eye-brows and
noses of the demons.
A hundred monkey-chiefs rushed towards each single demon in the battle, even as
birds would rush towards a tree laden with fruits.
Then, the demons resembling mountain in size, struck down the terrific monkeys with
large maces, darts, swords and axes.
The huge army of monkeys, being struck down by the demons, sought refuge in Rama,
the son of Dasaratha, who affords protection.
Thereupon, Rama of great splendour and prowess, taking up his bow and entering the
army of demons, streamed forth showers of arrows.
Those highly terrific demons dared not approach Rama, having entered their ranks,
was scorching them with the flame of his arrows, even as clouds would not approach the scorching
sun in the sky.
Those demons saw the most terrible deeds only of Rama, when they were actually
performed by him in the battle-field, which were difficult to perform for others.
Those demons could not actually see Rama, whle he was shaking their huge army and
blowing away their great chariots, any more than one could see a gale of wind in a forest.
They saw the army torn and pierced with arrows, as also scorched, broken down and
tormented with missiles. They could not see Rama, who was so swift in his martial art.
The demons could not behold Rama hitting their bodies, even as created beings are
not able to see their individual souls resting in their sense-objects.
"Here is Rama, killing the army of elephants. Here is Rama, destroying great
chariot-warriors. Here is Rama, killing foot-soldiers along with horses with his sharp arrows".
Saying so, all those demons struck one another with rage in the battle-field those who were in
similarity of appearance to Rama.
Having been thrown into confusion by the great mystic missile presided over by the
Gandharvas, the celestial musicians; presided over by the Gandharvas, the celestial musicians;
those demons were unable to see Rama, even when he was scorching away their army.
Those demons for their part saw thousands of Rama's in the battle-field, while at
other times, they saw only one Rama in that great battle.
Those demons for their part saw thousands of Ramas in the battle-field; while at
other times, they saw only one Rama in that great battle.
The created beings saw that Rama in the form of a discus, which was killing the
demons on the battle-field, like the "Wheel of Time", for its flame, the arrows for its spokes, his
bow for the felly of the wheel, the twanging of the bow-string and the clanging of the gauntlet for
the sound produced for its revolution, his energy and the virtues for its radiance and the power of
his mystic missiles for its edge.
Within a matter of three hours, with his arrows looking like tongues of flames, Rama
killed an army of demons, capable of changing their form at will, including ten thousands chariots
possessing the swiftness of the wind, eighteen thousand strong elephants, fourteen thousand horses
with their riders and a full two lacs of demons fighting on foot.
Those surviving demons, with their horses killed, with their chariots destroyed,
with thier flag-staffs broken and with broken spirits, rushed back towards the City of Lanka.
That battle-field, with elephants, foot-soldiers and horses killed, looked like a
pleasure-grave of the powerful and the enraged the lord of destruction.
Then, the celestials along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, holy saints and
great sages acclaimed that feat of Rama, saying "well done, well done!".
Then, the virtuous Rama spoke also to Sugreeva, Vibhishana, Hanuma the monkey,
Jambavan, Mainda the foremost of monkeys and even Dvivida, who were in close proximity to him as
follows "Such wonderful power of this missile exists either with me or with the three-eyed Rudra
the lord of destruction."
Rama, a compeer of Indra the lord of celestials, the great souled, unwearied in the
use of weapons and missiles, having destroyed that army of demons, was applauded by the rejoiced
troops of celestials.Seeing his brother lying down dead after defeat in battle, Vibhishana lamented, with
his mind filled with an outburst of sorrow:
"Why are you lying killed on the ground, though you are highly worthy of turning
towards lofty beds, O hero! The valiant one, the celebrated one, prudent in polity?"
"Having thrown about your two long arms which though decked wit armlets, are now
motionless and with your diadem brilliant as the sun, knocked down; why are you lying killed on the
ground/"
"O the valiant brother! That which was told by me earlier and that which was not
liked by you, as you were overcome with sensuality and infatuation; that very fate has been
obtained by you."
"For that which, because of arrogance, neither Prahasta nor Indrajit and others, nor
Kumbhakarna nor Atiratha nor Narantaka nor you yourself has agreed to my counsel, the consequence
of it has come now."
"As this hero, the foremost of those who wield the weapons, has fallen on the
ground, the established rule of well-conducted persons has gone. The incarnation of virtue has
departed. The epitome of strength has gone. The refuge of enlogies has gone out of sight. The sun
has fallen to the earth. The moon has merged in darkness. Fire has extinguished its flames and a
strennous effort has become inactive."
"What is remaining in this world now, while Ravana the foremost of demons, is at
present lying fast asleep in the dust?"
"With firmness for its shoot, endurance for its excellent blossom, asceticism for
its strength, and valour for its firm root, the large tree in the shape of Ravana has been crushed
in the battle-field, by the tempest in the shape of Rama."
"With sharpness for its tusks, the line of ancestors for its back-bone, anger for
its lower parts and graciousness for its proboscis, the elephant in rut in the shape of Ravana is
lying asleep on the ground, its body having been overthrown by a lion in the shape of Rama."
"With prowess and power for its expanded flames, sighs for its smoke and his native
strength for its glowing heat, the blazing fire in the shape of Ravana the demon has been
extingushed in the battle-field by the rainy cloud in the shape of Rama."
"With the demons for its tail; hump and horn and fickleness for its ears and eyes,
the bull in the shape of Ravana the demon, the conqueror of its enemies, which vied with the wind
in energy, is lying dead, struck down by a tiger in the shape of Rama, the ruler of the earth."
To Vibhishana, who was thus speaking; enveloped in sorrow, Rama spoke the following
words, full of reason and which revealed his determined view of the matter.
"Ravana did not die in battle, without making an effort. He has fallen in combat,
eventhough he was endowed with terrible prowess and exhibited extra ordinary enthusiasm of a very
exalted type and remained confident throughout."
"There is no occasion to grieve for him having fallen into death in the battle-field
and by whom the development of his country was wished for, while remaining steadfast in the duty of
Kshatriya the warrior."
"There is no occasion to grieve for his having been brought under the sway of death
by whom intelligent as he was, all the three worlds including indra were frightened."
"In the past, none has ever been exclusively victorious in a combat. A hero either
has been killed by his adversaries or had killed the enemies in battle."
"Such is the destiny proclaimed by the ancients, as highly esteemed for a warrior. A
warrior killed in battle, does not deserve to be mourned. Such is the ascertainment of the sacred
scriptures."
"Therefore, seeing this ascertainment, understanding the true principle, and free
from grief, think here of what duty that deserves to be performed."
To that valiant prince (Rama) by whom the aforesaid words were spoken, Vibhishana,
who was tormented with grief, spoke (as follows) about the suitable action to be done next in
relation to his brother.
"The demon, who had never been conquered before in battles, by even all the gods
combined or by Indra himself, has been conquered, on confronting you in the battle-field, as the
sea breaks up, on reaching the shore."
"By him, gifts were endowed to to mendicents. Pleasures too were enjoyed. The king's
servents were fully maintained. Rches were made over to friends. Grudges against enemiies were
revenged."
"He maintained a perpetually sacred fire. he practised great religious austerities.
He completely mastered Vedas, the sacred scriptures. He was highly proficient even in the ritual
acts. I desire to do, with you graciousness, that which is to be performed to him, who has departed
to the other world."
Thus getting the personality of Ravana well-acquainted by vibhishana by his
compassionate words, Rama possessing unimpaired goodness, directed Vibhishana to perfom funeral
rites, which were intended to lead the departed soul to heaven:
"Hostilities end with death. Our purpose has been accomplished. Let his funeral
rites be performed. He is even as good mine, as yours."Seeing that Seetha, who stood at his vicinity bowing low, Rama began to tell his
feeling hidden in his heart (as follows):
"You are won back by me, after conquering the enemy in the battle-field, my dear
lady! That which is to be done through human effort, has been accomplished by me."
"I have come to the end of my indignation and my outrage has been completely
requited as also the contempt against the enemy have been wiped out, all at once, by me."
"Now, my manly strength has been seen by all. Today, my toil has borne fruit. Now, I
have fulfilled my promise. Today, I am the master of myself."
"The wrong done to you, when you were deserted from me, in that you were taken away
by a fickle-minded demon, which was ordained by the destiny, has been corrected by me as a human
being."
"What is the use of a prowess, however great, of that weak-minded man who does not
wipe out, by his energy, the insult fallen to his lot?"
"The praise-worthy act of Hanuma in the form of crossing of the ocean and the
destroying of Lanka, has borne fruit today."
"The endeavour of Sugreeva, who exhibited his prowess on the battle-field with his
army and tendered a good advice, is fruitful today."
"Furthermore, the exertion of Vibhishana, who after deserting his brother who was
void of good qualities, sought my presence, is fruitful today.
Hearing those words spoken thus by Rama, Seetha with her eyes wide open like those
of a female-deer, was bathed in tears.
The heart of King Rama, as he saw Seetha, (the beloved of his heart) near him, was
torn for fear of public scandal.
In the midst of monkeys and demons, Rama spoke (as follows) to Seetha, whose eyes
resembled the petals of a lotus, who wore dark curly hair and was endowed with fine hips.
"I, wanting for an honour, have done this particular act, which ought to be done by
a man, in killing Ravana and thus wiping away the insult meted out to me."
"You have been won by me, whose mind stands purified by asceticism as the southern
quarter, which was difficult to be approached by the world of mortals, was conquered by the Sage
Agastya."
"Let it be known to you that this endeavor in the shape of war, which has been
successful carried through, due to the strength of my friends was not undertaken for your sake. Let
there be prosperity to you! This was done by me in order to keep up my good conduct and to wipe off
the evil-speaking from all sides as well as the insinuation on my own illustrious dynasty."
"You, with a suspicion arisen on your character, standing in front of me, are
extremely disagreeable to me, even as a light to one, who is suffering from a poor eye-sight."
"O Seetha! That is why, I am permitting you now. Go wherever you like. All these ten
directions are open to you, my dear lady! There is no work to be done to me, by you."
"Which noble man, born in an illustrious race, will take back a woman who lived in
another's abode, with an eager mind?"
"While mentioning greatly about my lineage, how can I accept again, you who were
harassed in Ravana's lap (while being borne away by him) and who were seen (by him) with evil
looks?"
"You were won by me with that end in view (viz. the retrieval of my lost honour).
The honour has been restored by me. For me, there is no intense attachment in you. You may go
wherever you like from here."
"O gracious lady! Therefore, this has been spoken by me today, with a resolved mind.
Set you mind on Lakshmana or Bharata, as per your ease."
"O Seetha! Otherwise, set your mind either on Shatrughna or on Sugreeva or on
Vibhishana the demon; or according to your own comfort."
"Seeing you, who are endowed with a beautiful form and attractive to the sense,
detained for long in his abode, Ravana could not have endured your separation."
Hearing that unpalatable speech of her beloved husband, Seetha who used to hear
pleasing words alone, was very much trembled for long, like a creeper attacked by the proboscis of
an elephant and thereupon shed tears.Thereupon, Lakshmana obeying his brother's order which is kindly and auspicious,
went immediately to the house of suyajna.
Offering salutation to that brahmana living in a house of fire, Lakshmana spoke as follows: "Oh, friend! Come and see the house of Rama who is doing an arduous task."
Then, Suyajna, having performed worship at the juncture of day and night, came at
once along with Lakshmana and entered Rama's house which was good-looking and inhabited by Lakshmi the goddess of wealth.
Seeing him arrived, Rama with joined palms along with Seetha, moved clockwise as
around sacrificial fire, that Suyajna the venerable man who had the knowledge of Vedas.
Rama adored Suyajna with excellent Angadas(armlets) and beautiful earrings of gold, gems stung on gold threads as also with keyuras( another ornament similar in shape to an Angada but worn above it near the armpit) and bracelets as well as with many other excellent precious stones.
urged by Seetha, the said Rama then spoke to suyajna as follows:
"Oh the gentle sage, my friend! Now, Seetha wants to give for your wife a pearl
necklace, a string of gold and a girdle. please take them."
"Oh, friend! Seetha who is departing to the forest, is giving you for your wife
armlets adorned with figures cut in them and beautiful keyuras."
"Seetha wants to offer you that couch also inlaid with various jewels and provided with an excellent coverlet."
"Oh, the best of brahmanas! I am giving you this elephant called Satrunjaya, given earlier to me by my maternal uncle as well as those thousand elephants."
As requested by Rama, suyajna accepted the gift and bestowed bening blessings to
Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha.
Then, Rama who speaks polite words as coolly as Brahma to Devendra, spoke to his
beloved brother Lakshmana as follows: "Oh, Lakshmana! Call those two excellent brahmanas Agastya and Kausika and worship them with valuable gifts as water is poured to a crop of corn."
"Oh, Lakshmana the honour-giver, with great arms! Satiate them with thousands of
cows, gold, silver and with gems of great value."
"Oh, Lakshmana! Which brahman is studying Taittiriya(a school of yajurveda), a
preceptor, a man of conformity; a knower of Vedas, serving Kausalya with his devotion and blessing, to him see that he is duly gifted conveyance, servant maids and silken clothing till he gets satisfied."
"The charioteer called Chitraratha the companion of our venerable father was of very long standing. Gratify him with valuable gifts of great worth, with clothes, with money, with all types of small animals and with thousands of cows."
Here are many religious students carrying staffs, belonging to katha and kalaapa
branches of Yajurveda, who being always engaged in studying the sacred scriptures, do not perform any other austerities but are highly honoured by even noble men, are inactive( in the sense, they do not move out for alms) and crave for sweets. Cause them to be given eighty carts loaded with jewels, a thousand bullocks carrying loads of rice and two hundred bullocks used for cultivation.
Give a thousand cows for use in their nourishment, Oh Lakshmana!"
"Oh, Lakshmana! Many celebates wearing fillets stand near Kausalya, cause them to be given a thousand cows each."
"Honour all those brahmanas in every way, so that my mother Kausalya will feel happy to see my gifts."
Then, Lakshmana the tiger among men himself gave that wealth, like Kubera, to the
best of brahmanas as instructed.
Rama, after giving abundant wealth to each one of the dependents, standing there
with tears in their throats, spoke to them as follows;
"Till my return, the house belonging to Lakshmana and also this house which is
occupied by me, should be guarded by each one of you, by turn."
Having thus ordered those servants distressed as they were, he instructed his
treasurer as follows: "Let my wealth be brought(here)."
Thereafter, the servants brought all the wealth of Rama. That very large heap of
wealth there appeared good-looking.
Rama, the tiger among men, along with Lakshmana then caused that wealth to be
distributed among the brahmanas, the children, the old-aged and the pitiable.
"There lived a brahmana by name Trijata who was born in garga community and was
reddish born in colour. He used to make his living in the forest by digging the soil, always carrying an axe, a spade and a plough."
His young wife, having been afflicted with poverty, taking her small children with her, spoke to that aged brahmana as follows:
"Throw away the axe and the spade. Carry out my word. Seek for the presence of Rama who knows his duty and see if you get at least something."
He heard the request of his wife, wrapped a strip of cloth that could hardly cover his body and set out towards the track wherein lies Rama's palace.
Up to the fifth gate, none in that society of men could obstruct this Trijata, who was equal in spiritual splendour with the sages Bhrigu and Angira.
That Trijata having approached the prince Rama, spoke the following words: "Oh, the most illustrious prince! I am a destitute, having many children in my family. I always dwell in the forest, with an occupation of digging the soil. Look to me, as you know."
Thereupon, Rama replied jestingly to him as follows: " By me, even one thousand cows were not given away so far. You will get as many cows to such an extent as you will throw this staff."
Winding his loin cloth round his waist hurrily and twirling his staff, he swiftly
threw it with all his strength, excited as he was.
Flying away from his hand and crossing across the Sarayu river, that staff fell
close to a bull amidst a flock of cows numbering in several thousands.
Embracing him, Rama of virtuous mind caused to be delivered to Trijata's hermitage the cows up to that bank of Sarayu.
Thereupon, Rama pacifyingly spoke to that son of Gargi as follows: "You need not
express your contempt, for this was only a jest indulged in by me."
"I only desired to know your strength, which is unfathomable and hence this trial
for you. If you desire any other thing, opt for it."
" I am telling the truth here. There is no limitation for you. Whatever riches
belonging to me, are indeed for brahmanas. If the wealth earned by me is given abundantly to you, it will bring in joy and fame."
Thereupon, Trijata along with his wife accepted that flock of cows and were
delighted. Then, he pronounced on Rama the virtuous man, the blessings to enhance reputation, strength, delight and happiness.
Rama being inspired by the befitting words of honour and having his heart satisfied, immediately bestowed on friendly people, a great wealth earned by righteous might.
At that time in Ayodhya, there was no brahmana, relative, dependant, pauper or
mendicant who was not satiated with befittingly deserving honour, gifts and respect.
On seeing the shattering of his own forces, Duushana bid five thousand mighty-armed nightwalkers of 
monstrous impetus, and who knew no retreat in war, to attack Rama. 
And they with spears, scimitars, swords, and with the rains of boulders, trees and arrows rained incessantly 
and inordinately upon Rama from all over. 
Raghava, the virtue-souled, in his turn has neutralised that ghastly and life-taking storm of boulders 
and trees with his fierce arrows. 
Like a bull receiving rain with closed eyes Rama assimilated that storming and then evoked an inordinate 
infuriation for eliminating all of the demons. 
Exasperation prevailing on him who appeared to be highly blazing with the blaze of his own virtue, he 
then diffused Duushana and his army with arrows from all over. 
And on becoming enraged Duushana, the railer of his rivals and the commander of that army, then virtually 
forestalled Raghava's onslaught with his arrows that are simulative of thunderbolts. 
That valiant one in warring Rama is then infuriated and with his crescent-barbed arrow shivered the 
sturdy bow of Duushana, shredding four of his horses with four more arrows. 
On destructing the horses with excruciating arrows, he even fragmented the head of the charioteer with 
a crescent-barbed arrow, and even impaled the chest of demon Duushana with some more arrows. 
With his bow fractured and chariot shredded, and with horses and charioteer killed, he that Duushana 
grabbed a mace which outranks a peak of mountain and a hair-thriller at its sight, and which girt with 
golden girths once gritted the armies of gods, the head of which is studded with incisive iron spikes 
and saturated with the fat of foes, a coequal of a diamond and a thunderbolt in its hardiness and flashiness, 
and a ransacker of the archways of fortresses of his adversaries. 
On firmly gripping that mace which in war is akin to an infernal serpent, and the touch of which tantamount 
to snakebite, rushed that nightwalker Duushana with infernal exerts rushed towards Rama. 
While Duushana came falling on, he that Raghava sheared off his shoulders that have wrist-ornaments 
on his arms with two arrows. 
When Duushana's arms are thus sheared in the van of war, his gigantic mace slipped and spun in his own 
front, like the flagstaff with flag raised in honour of Indra, and collapsed . 
With both of his arms strewn around Duushana fell down onto earth like a haughty and gigantic elephant 
when both of its tusks are broken down. 
On seeing Duushana eliminated and fallen to ground, all the beings have applauded Rama saying, 'good, 
good...' 
In the meantime infuriated are the three leading commanders of that army, namely Mahakapaala, Sthulaaksha 
and great mighty Pramaathii, and they collectively ran towards Rama, bound by the rein of death. 
As one would receive guests meeting his basic needs, Raghava too took on these untimely guests of war, 
rather the insurgents, meeting their basic needs which now are no more than highly sharpened acute edged 
arrows, when he saw them coming and falling upon him, inopportunely. 
Rama, the legatee of Raghu, chopped off the head of Mahakapaala, with incalculable spates of arrows 
he eliminated Pramaathi, and filled the bulging eyes of Sthulaaksha with arrows by which Sthulaaksha 
is killed and fell down onto ground like a burly tree with its broad branches. Then still infuriated 
Rama forthwith eliminated the five thousand hench-demons of Duushana with five thousand arrows, and 
thus he led them to the residence of Time-god, namely the hell. 
On hearing about the killing of Duushana and also thus of the followers of Duushana, Khara irately ordered 
his army captains, under whose captaincy mighty forces are there. 
"Duushana is killed in war along with his followers, hence all you demons, take formidable army, take 
weapons of diverse designs, combat and kill that evil-human Rama..." Thus Khara ordered the remaining 
demons. 
Saying so Khara himself rushed towards Rama in rage, and Shyenagaami, Prithugriiva, Yajnashatru, Vihangama 
Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, and Rudhiraaksha 
are the twelve fiendishly atrocious troop leaders of demonic forces, and they too rushed towards Rama 
launching their atrocious arrows. 
He who is resplendent that Rama then annihilated the remaining demons of that army with his arrows that 
are embellished with gold and diamonds, and that are blazing like ritual-fires. 
With those arrows that have golden tailpieces and sharp barbs, and that are dazzling like fuming ritual 
fires Rama felled the demons, as Thunderbolts of Indra will be felling gigantic trees. 
With a hundred rudder like arrows Rama hit down a hundred demons, and with a thousand more, thousand 
more demons are hit in the forefront of that war. 
Ripped are their shields and armorial-ornaments, ruined and rickety are their bows, and they the nightwalkers 
fell flat on ground, bodies wholly smudged with blood. 
With those demons that have fallen down in war, whose hair is tousled and who are drenched in blood, 
entire earth looked like a vast altar of fire overspread with holy grass. 
That forest which became sludgy with the flesh and blood of killed demons and very disgusting, in a 
moment it became identical with hell. 
Thus that Rama, a lone one, that too a foot-soldier, has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of frightening 
exploits. 
Of his entire army great-charioteer Khara and Trishira are the remaining nightwalkers, and Rama, the 
enemy destroyer, naturally on the other side. 
Lakshmana's elder brother Rama eliminated all of the remaining demons in the forefront of war who are 
highly valorous, ghastly and unbearable. 
Then on surveying that great demonic force which is eliminated by Rama in that staggering war, Khara 
then marched on to reach Rama in a huge chariot, as with Indra who will march upraising his Thunderbolt. 
Then on arriving at Raghava's hermitage that ghastly Shuurpanakha has shown the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, 
along with Seetha to the fourteen demons. 
They have seen the great-mighty Rama seated in the thatched cottage along with Seetha and Lakshmana 
attending to him. 
On seeing the arrival of the demons, and the demoness Shuurpanakha too, that magnificent Rama of Raghava 
dynasty said to the radiantly brilliant Lakshmana. 
"Oh, Soumitri, briefly tarry at the close of Seetha as I wish to eliminate these demons who have trailed 
the path of that demoness to here. 
On hearing that word of Rama, then the nimble-souled Lakshmana honoured the word of Rama saying "so 
be it." 
On taking up his awful bow that is decorated with gold Raghava stringed it with bowstring and even spoke 
the demons as a forewarning. 
"We the sons of Dasharatha are brothers named Rama and Lakshmana, and we entered the impenetrable forests 
Dandaka along with Seetha. 
"We the dispassionate subsist on fruits and tubers treading in the path of virtue, and we being the 
sages resident in Dandaka forest what for you outrage us. 
"As assigned by the sages I chanced here with bow and arrows to decimate you evil-souled and unrighteous 
beings in a crucial clash. 
"Stay there obligingly or you should not be able to return, else if you desire your lives, oh, nightwalkers, 
you may return now. 
On hearing that sentence of Rama they the fourteen ghoulish demons who are the slayers of Brahmans and 
handlers of spears have become highly infuriated, and they with their bloodshot eyes and with harsh 
words said these words to Rama, whose eyes are with blood streaks at their ends, and who also is a sweet 
talker, and whose valour is yet unseen by those fourteen demons. 
"Killed in conflict by us you alone will set your lives loose as an inciter of fury in our highly great 
souled lord Khara. 
"Indeed, what capability you have as a lone one to stand against many of us in the forefront of war, 
and why tell again about your battling ability in a given battle. 
"When we launch maces, spears and swords by our might you will forgo your lives, mettle, and even the 
bow now clasped in your hand." So said the demons to Rama. 
"Oh! Supreme Person, we have come here because you incited anger 
in our lord Khara, and by us killed will you let go your lives, mettle and spirits? No. Never it will 
happen."
The reason for not happening of that event is explained: raNa 
muurdhan in war's, van; ekasya te agrataH sthaatum lone one, you, before, to stand;
bahuunaam asmaakam api many, we are, though; kaa shaktiH where is, capability for 
us
"Though you are a lone being, and we are many, where is the capability 
for us to stand before you in the van of war?"
Thus they say that they have come only at the behest of their 
lord but not to kill Rama. baahuH yuktaiH parighaiH shuula paTTisaiH upalakshitaanaam though 
equipped with our paraphernalia like maces, spears, swords etc., adhyaahaara: asmaakam our;
praaNaan viiryam tyakshasi lives, vitality, we loose; ehi come... give us salvation.
"Though we are equipped with much paraphernalia like maces, spears, 
swords etc., we lose our lives and vitality at your hand, so come on, take them away, and accord salvation 
and release from our curse. It is better to die at your hand than returning to Khara and dying a merciless 
death at the hand of Khara.
It may be remembered that these fourteen are the cursed Vedic-scholarly 
disciples of Chandrakanta, now in an accursed form namely Khara and other demons. Maheshvara Tiirtha.
Thus saying that way clamorously they the fourteen demons, upraising their weapons they unhesitatingly 
rushed towards Rama alone, and they hurled lances towards that unconquerable Raghava. 
Rama in turn shredded all of those fourteen lances only with as many arrows that are adorned in gold. 

Next that great resplendent Rama in high wrath took up fourteen iron bolt like arrows that are whetted 
on whetstone and equalling the sun in their dazzle. 
Then Raghava took up his bow, arched it, and aiming at the targeted demons released arrows as Indra 
would release his Thunderbolts. 
And by the force of their speed those arrows gored the chests of those demons, and then on coming out 
bedaubed with blood they swiftly penetrated into earth like snakes into snake pit. 
Those arrows bursting their hearts they are blood bathed, mangled, and utterly dead, and like the uprooted 
trees they fell onto the ground. 
On seeing the demons falling onto ground that demoness Shuurpanakha is convulsed in rage, and she with 
a blanched aspect returned to the near of Khara in an agonising manner like a creeper exuding resin 
on incision, and fell before him as before. 
Then she in the presence of her brother Khara discharged a great outcry, and with a bloodless face she 
spilled tears attuning the strains of a whiner. 
Shuurpanakha having seen the fall of demons quickly fled from Panchavati of Rama to trikanTaka, the 
capital of Khara, and she being the sister of Khara she reported to Khara all about the destruction 
of those demons, in its entirety. This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. 
The sublimity of Seetha's characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether 
Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature 
as to 'why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some 
rains and go...' If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against 
her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called 
a woman who isbhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi'blinded by the devotement to her 
husband...' 'a desirer of her husband's welfare...' even at her own risk.
This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It israama ayanaand becomesraamaayaNawhen 
compounded. Againraamais not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is alsoraamaaas 
said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. , th verse:
Thus this epic is calledraamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam'the peregrination of Seetha and 
Rama...' where the first wordraamaawith elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the 
secondraamawith shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination 
of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, 
and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation 
occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, 
good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that 
of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no 
oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote.
On identifying the grievous voice that is identifiable with her husband's voice, Seetha spoke to Lakshmana, 
"you go at once, and check up on Raghava.' 
"I have heard the loud yelling voice of highly fretful Rama whereby my heart, or my very entity, is 
not abiding in its place, and it will be apt of you to protect such a brother of yours who is screaming 
in the forest. 
"He might have come under the subjugation of demons as with a bull coming under the seize of lions, 
hence, you hurry up so as to near such a brother of yours who is seeking protection." So said Seetha 
toi Lakshmana. 
Although she spoke a lot to him in this way, Lakshmana on his part has not moved out remembering his 
brother's order to stay guard to Seetha, and hence that Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, who is already 
agitated for Rama further spoke to him in the paradox of his not going out of hermitage. 
"You are like a foe of your brother in friend's mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards 
a brother even if he is in an emergency. 
"Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you 
are not following up on Raghava. It is definite. 
" 'Raghava in direst strait' is the most liked thing to you, thus I deem, as you have no heart for that 
brother, and as you complacently stay behind even when that great-resplendent Rama is unseen. 
"After which helmsman you have come here that Rama is undergoing an uncertainty of life-and-death, as 
such I indeed wonder what business you have here now in staying with me at this hermitage?" Seetha spoke 
so to Lakshmana. 
Lakshmana spoke to Seetha, the princess from Videha kingdom, who is talking deluged under tears and 
anguish in that way, as she is fretful like a she-deer. 
"Oh, Vaidehi, your husband is an impossible one for vincibility by serpents, asura-s, gandharva-s, gods, 
fiends, demons, no doubt about it.
"Oh, auspicious one, unmarked is some combatant who can counterattack Rama from among gods, humans, 
gandharva-s, birds, ogres, kinnaraa-s, beasts, or oh, lady, even from horrendous demons, as Rama vies 
with Indra in any given war. 
"It is inapt of you to talk that way as Rama is inextirpable in a given war, and as for me, I do not 
venture to abandon you in this forest in the absence of Raghava. 
"Let the most forceful Crowns with all their military forces, or, all of the gods together with their 
heads, why they, let all the three worlds put together come mutinously, whether jointly or severally, 
Rama's prowess is irrestrainable. 
"Hence, let your heart be diverted and anxiety divested, as your husband will be returning soon on killing 
that extraordinary deer. 
"Evidently it is not the voice of Rama, nor that of any other god, but someone mimicked that voice for 
chicanery, and that must be the illusory voice of that demon Maareecha, similar in effect to the magical 
city of gandharva-s usually created by magicians in general. 
"And you are an entrustment, oh, best lady Vaidehi, as the great-souled Rama has entrusted you in my 
security, as such I do not dare to leave you off now. 
"Oh, gracious lady, we have become the adversaries of these night-walkers insofar as the elimination 
of Khara and others, and concerning the eradication of Janasthaana. 
"The demons are the swaggerers in violence in great forests and they will be employing various voices. 
Therefore Vaidehi, just do not bother about it." Thus Lakshmana advised Seetha. 
As for Seetha, she became furious on hearing Lakshmana's words of advice, and while her eyes are becoming 
bloodshot she spoke these rude sentences to that veracious Lakshmana. 
"You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem 
that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama. 
"You are haranguing all these sermons only on noticing hardship to Rama. It is unsurprising that the 
pitiless ones and rivals of your kind, who always behave in a cloak-and dagger way, will tend to commit 
deadly sins, Lakshmana, and it is not uncommon. 
"You are verily maleficent for you have singly and covertly followed Rama, who started to forests all 
alone, or instigated by Bharata, only because of me. 
"Whether this is an intrigue of yours or that of Bharata it is unachievable, Saumitri. How can I long 
for another commoner when I have put my faith only in the lotus-blue-complexioned and lotus-bright-eyed 
husband of mine, Rama? 
"If that comes to that, I will just discard my life in your presence, Soumitri do not mistake it. I 
do not eke out an existence on this earth even for a moment without Rama." Thus Seetha threatened Lakshmana. 

When that self-mortified Lakshmana is addressed in this way with hair-raising and acerbic words by Seetha, 
he spoke to her suppliantly adjoining his palm-fold. 
"I do not venture to reply you Maithili, as you are like a deity to me. Women using words that are in 
a class by themselves is not at all surprising. This sort of bringing stilted words into play is the 
nature of women and it is obvious in the world. 
"Women by their nature are unbound by the etiquette of decency, whimsical, cantankerous and they tend 
to become the artificers of vicissitudes, and oh, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka, indeed unbearable 
are this kind of words that are much the same as burnt iron arrows thrust in between my two ears. 
"Let all of the forest-itinerants indeed listen as to how you are addressing me with bitter words, though 
I am reasoning with you conscientiously, and let them become my corroborators for the sake of justice. 

"Fie upon you, you are acrimoniously tempered owing to your faminality, and by which impulsive reason 
you mistrust me who am presently abiding in my brother's order, may God damn you for that crotchety. 

"I am going there where Rama is, oh, lady with best visage, you be blest, and oh, broad-eyed one, let 
all of the forest deities protect you. 
"Gauging by those dangerous forebodings that are now bidding fair, can I to see you again along with 
Rama on my return, or not? That I do not know." Thus Lakshmana spoke to Seetha. 
When Lakshmana spoke to that wailful daughter of Janaka, she on her part spoke this curt sentence to 
him, while tears whelmed her to a fault. 
"Without Rama I plunge myself in River Godavari, or else I string up myself, or discard this body of 
mine from heights..." Thus Seetha started to vent out her feelings. 
"I drink deadly poison, or I enter a flaring fire, but I will never touch another man other than Raghava. 

Seetha on declaring to Lakshmana in this way, she who is anguished and weeping bitterly, then started 
to smite her belly with both of her palms in a heightened agony. 
Observing the agonised aspect of Seetha that cheerless Saumitri started to cheer her up by repeatedly 
informing that her husband Rama will come soon. Even then Seetha has not spoken in the least to the 
brother of her husband, and maintained a silence of antipathy. 
But then, holding Seetha in usual reverence that self-respectful Lakshmana briefly came to her fore 
making a reverential palm-fold that briefly, and then he proceeded to the proximity of Rama, while repeatedly 
looking back at that lonely lady in the thick of forest. Having taken his bow, Rama of great brilliance and prowess, then beheld the bulky
Kumbhakarna, adorned with a diadem.
Seeing that paramount demon, whose appearance was in the form of a mountain and
looking like Lord Narayana (the son of the original Man); taking strides across space, (manifested
in the form of Trivikrama, who measured the whole universe in a couple of strides) Rama became
vigilant.
Beholding him again, who was appear like a rainy black cloud and wearing a golden
bracelet as an ornament on his upper arm, that huge army of monkeys took to their heels in full
speed.
Seeing the army running away and the demon increasing his body, Rama with a
surprise, spoke to vibhishana as follows:
"This eminent demon, appearing as a mountain, with a diadem and tawmy eyes and
looking like a cloud with a flash of lightning, is seen in Lanka. Who is he?"
"He alone with a huge body here on this earth, is appearing like a solitary meteror,
by seeing whom all the monkeys are running away hither and thither."
"Who is he with such a colossal body? Tell me whether he is a demon or an evil
spirit. I have not seen such a creature earlier at any time."
Thus asked by Rama the prince, who was unweary in action, the highly intelligent
Vibhishana replied to Rama as follows:
"He is the powerful Kumbhakarna, the son of Visravasa. He conquered Yama and Indra
in battle. Tehre is no other demon, corresponding to the size of his body."
"O Rama! He conquered thousands of celestials, demons, a class of demi-gods, serpent
demons, ogres, Gandharvas teh celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the celestials artistes and Kinnaras
(the semi-divine beings with the human form and the head of a horse) in battle."
"Seeing the mighty Kumbharana with ghastly eyes and a spear in hand, the celestials
were not able to kill him, having confused to think that he was yama the god of Death."
"This Kumbhakarna, by his very nature, is energetic and mighty. The strength of the
other demon-chiefs is attributable to boons (granted on request by gods)."
"Soon after his birth, this great-souled demon, afflicted as he was by hunger, ate
thousands of living creatures."
"While the living being were being eaten, the frightened people sought refuge with
Indra and even reported the matter about him."
That Mahendra wielding a thunder-bolt was enraged and struck Kumbhakarna with his
weapon of the white thunderbolt. The great souled Kumbhakarna struck by Indra's thunderbolt was
quite agitatated at it and roared loudly with anger."
"Hearing the roar of that Kumbakarna, the demon, wh was howling loudly, the
grigthened people were further frightened."
"Enraged as he was on Mahendra, the mighty Kumbhakarna then pulled out a tusk of
Airavata, Indra's elephant and struck it into Indra's chest."
"That Devendra, tormented by the hit of Kumbhakarna, was burning with rage. The
celestials, Brahmanical sages and demons were suddenly aggrieved. Even Indra with his people went
to the abode of Brahma the Lord of creation."
"They informed about the evil-mind of Kumbhakarna to Brahma, how he devoured the
living creatures, his assault on celestials, the destroyal of hermitages and his taking away of
others' wives."
"If he eats away the created beings continuously like this, the world will become
desolate just soon after some time."
"On hearing the words of Indra, Brahama, the great grandfather of the entire world,
called for the demons and saw Kumbhakarna too along with them."
"Just on seeing Kumbhakarna even Brahma was frightened. Thereafter on restoring his
confidence, Brahma cursed Kumbhakarna as follows:
"It is sure that you were created by visravasa for the destroyal of people. On that
account, you will be sleeping apparently dead from now onwards."
"Humbled by Brahma's curse, Kumbhakarna then fell down in front of Ravana.
Thereupon, the highly perplexed Ravana spoke the following words:"
"'O Brahma! You are cutting off a well-grown golden tree, just at the time of
yielding its fruit. It is not fair on your part to curse your own great grandson like this."
"Your words can never prove to be in vain. There is no doubt about it. He will have
to sleep certainly. Let some space of time be fixed for his sleeping and waking."
"Hearing the words of Ravana, Brahma spoke as follows: He will indeed sleep for six
months and wake-up for a day."
"On that single day, this male demon, having starved for six months, will wander
over the earth and eat the human race with his month wide open, like an augmented fire."
"Ravana, the king of demons, who got into an evil plight and frightened as he was in
seeing your prowess, now got Kumbhakarna awakened."
"This Kumbhakarna the male-demon with a terrific prowess started his tent. The
highly enraged Kumbhakara devourincg the monkeys on is way, is running towards us."
"Even on merely seeing Kumbhakarna, the monkeys have now fled away. How can the
monkeys check him, who is thus enraged in battle?"
"Let all the monkeys be told that it is a kind of machine, advancing forward. By
knowing this, they can become fearless by now."
On hearing Vibhishana's words, which were well-founded to make the monkeys
well-inclined to fight the battle, Rama then spoke the follwoing words to neela, the chief of
army:
"O Neela the son of fire-god. Go, marshalling the entire army. Occupying the
door-ways, high-ways and bridges of Lanka, stand ready for operation."
"Draw together the mountain-tops, trees and even the rocks. Let all the monkeys with
their weapons and rocks in hand, stand ready."
As directed by Raghavana, Neela the commander-in-chief and the foremost of the
monkeys, ordered the monkey-troops suitably.
Then, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Hanuma and Angada looking like mountains, reached the
gate, taking the mountian-tops.
On hearing Rama's words, the fearless monkeys started their operation. The heroic
monkeys began to torment the enemy-troops with uplifted trees.
That terrific army of monkeys, with uplifted rocks and tress in their hands, shone
like a big collection of gigantic clouds, hanging close to a mountain.Rama saw Bharata, with matted locks, wearing bark-robes and, with joined palms,
lying on the ground, incapable of being seen as the sun at the time of the dissolution of the world.
Rama recognized with some difficulty his brother Bharata, whose face became pale and who was emaciated, and took him by the arm.
Smelling the crown of his head, placing him on his lap, Rama who was born in Raghu dynasty embraced Bharata and with an absorbent mind, enquired of him as follows:
"My darling! Where is our father, that you have come to the forest? He, being alive, you ought not have to come to the forest."
"I see you after a long time, coming from a far-off distance, wearing a mournful
face into this forest Alas! Why have you come to the forest, my darling?"
"My dear brother! Is the king alive, that you have come here? I hope the miserable king has not indeed departed to the other world, all of a sudden."
"O, gentle brother! I hope the eternal kingdom has in a no way suffered from your
youthful experience. My darling! Are you rendering service to our father, who is truly valiant?"
"I hope that the King Dasaratha is well, he who is true to his promise, he who
performs Rajasuya and Ashvamedha Sacrifices and he who has a righteous resolve."
"My darling! Are you treating respectfully as before that preceptor of the
Ikshvakus, the one who knows the sacred scriptures, the one who knows the sacred scriptures, the learned who constantly keep up the virtues and he who has a great splendour?"
"My darling! I hope that Kausalya and Sumitra having good offspring are happy. I
hope the venerable queen Kaikeyi is rejoicing."
"I hope that the preceptor (Suyajgna the son of Vasishta); who is rich in humility, a son of a noble family, who has a knowledge of many scriptures an unenvious person and who is full of insight, is duly honoured by you."
"I hope that a brahmin who is versed in the traditions, who is intelligent and just, employed in your sacred fires, always informs you in time, about a sacrificial fire having been or going to be fed with oblations."
"My darling! I hope that you are holding in high esteem the gods, your ancestors,
dependents and teachers of your father's age the doctors and the brahmins."
"O, my darling! I hope that you treat with due respect; Sudhanva, your teacher in
archery, who is furnished with the most excellent arrows and darts and well-versed in political economy."
"I hope that ministers who are valiant like you, learned, masters of their senses of noble birth and skilled interpreting internal sentiments by external gesture, are assigned to you."
"The source of victory for kings indeed comes from a concealed counsel by ministers, who are well-versed in political sciences and who can hide their thoughts within themselves."
"I hope you do not fall a prey to excess of sleep and do wake up at appropriate
time. I hope you contemplate during the later half of the night, about the adroitness of an action."
"I hope that you do not deliberate alone nor indeed with numerous men. I hope your decision arrived at by you through such deliberation does not flow to the public (even before it is carried out)".
"O, Bharata! I hope considering your interest fully, you lanuch an undertaking,
which has maximum benefit with minimum coast and indeed do not delay it further."
"I hope the other kings know your entire undertakings only after they have been
successfully completed as well as those which have taken a shape, but not your proposed undertakings."
"My darling! I hope that others are not knowing, by their enquiries or strategies or by any other approaches not mentioned, the details of discussions you make with your ministers."
"I hope you solicit for one wise man rather than for a thousand stupids for, a wise man can be of a great help to you in difficult matters."
"Even if a king employs thousands or tens of thousands of fools, they will not be
helpful to him."
"Even one wise, valiant sagacious and efficient minister alone can cause to secure a great prosperity to the king or to one who enjoys royal authority."
"I hope that superior servants are assigned superior works only, mediocre servants in mediocre works and inferior servants in inferior works."
"I hope you are appointing those ministers, who are eminent incorruptible, born of the fathers and for bears of good family and who are full of integrity in matters of great importance."
"O, Bharata! I hope your ministers do not watch as mere witnesses, while your
subjects in the kingdom wielding tremble with great fear, under your inflexible wielding of the scepter."
"I hope those who perform the sacrifice do not hold you in contempt, as one who
accepts terrible gifts; as one who is fallen, as women hold in contempt of those highly lustful men."
"He, who does not slay a physician skilled in ways and means of aggravating a
disease, a servant intent on bringing disgrace and a valiant warrior seeking kingly power, is *himself) slain by them."
"I hope an army-chief, who is cheerful, wise, courageous, valiant, well-behaved,
born in a good family, who is beloved by his subordinates and efficient, is selected by you."
"I hope those warriors, who are excellent strong, skilled in war-face, whose
excellent actions were seen before and the most courageous ones are duly honoured and respected by you."
"I hope you are regularly giving your army, the daily provisions and the suitable
salary to them, without any delay."
"When there is delay in giving bread and wages, the servants become incensed against their master and become corrupt; and that is said to be a great unfortunate occurrence."
"I hope all the foremost descendents of your race (kshatriyas) are devoted to you
and do they lay down their lives steadfastly for your sake?"
"I hope that a knowledgeable man, living in your own country, a wise man a skilled person endowed with presence of mind and the one who knows how to speak to the point, is selected as an ambassador by you."
"Do you get to know throught three spies, each unacquainted with each other, about the eighteen* functionaries of the enemies and the fifteen functionaries of your own side?"
"O, slayer of your Foes! I hope you do not forever think lightly of your foes, who are weak and having been expelled, return again."
I hope are not honouring the materialistic brahmins, My dear brother! These men are skilled in perverting the mind, ignorant as they are and thinking themselves to be learned."
"Reaching to their logical acumen, these men of perverted intellect preach
meaninglessly, in the presence of eminent books on righteousness."
"I hope you preserve the City of Ayodhya, furnished with everything and flourishing, that was formerly inhabited by our heroic ancestors, O my dear brother, that is worthy of its name, with its fortified gates, its elephant horses and chariots that fill it, with its brahmins, warriors and merchants in thousands, ever engaged in their respective duties, with its noble citizens self-controlled and full of energy, with its palaces in various shapes and the learned who abound there."
I hope that the kingdom, adorned with peaceful places rich in temples and sheds
where water stored for distribution to passers-by in tanks, with happy men and women, graced by social festivities, with land well-tilled, abiding in cattle which are totally free from cruelties, the agricultural land not exclusively fed by rains, which is beautiful and is purged of beasts of prey, which is completely rid of fears, studded with mines, a destitute of sinful men, and well-protected by our fore-fathers, is prosperous and an abode of happiness.
"Are you cherishing all those who live by agriculture and cattle-rearing, O, dear
borhter! The people living on agriculture and cattle-rearing indeed prosper well."
"I hope their maintenance is being looked after by you, in providing what they need and eschewing what they fear. All the citizens are indeed to be protected by a king through his righteousness."
"I hope you are pacifying the women well. Are they protected by you? I hope you are not believing the words of these women and not telling them the secrets."
"Are you supervising the woods inhabited by elephants? I hope female elephants are there to you in good number. I hope you are not simply satisfied with the existing population of female elephants, horses and male-elephants."
"O, Prince! Do you, regally adorned, appear before the people on rising each
morning, on the great high way?"
"I hope that all your servants, in your presence, do not adopt a disrespectful
attitude or on the other hand all of them do not hasten away on seeing you. Ofcourse, a middle course only in the principle to be followed in this matter."
"I hope all your citadels are quite full of money, grain, weapons, water and
mechanical contrivances as well as artisans and archers."
"I hope your income is abundant and expenditure, minimum. I hope your treasure does not reach undeserving people, O, Bharata!"
"I hope that your expenditure goes for the cause of divinity, manes, brahmins,
unexpected visitors, soldiers and hosts of friends."
"If one of noble work, despite his honesty and integrity, is falsely accused of some offence, I hope he is not killed impatiently, without enquiry by those well-versed in law-books."
"O, foremost of men! If a thief is seen and even caught at the time of his act on
sufficient ground and interrogated-I hope, he is not released from greed of wealth."
"O, Bharata! I hope that your well-educated ministers examine a case dispassionately when a contention occurs between a rich man and a poor man, after studying the situation carefully."
"The tears fallen from those who are the victims of false accusations, O Bharata,
destroy their sons and herds of those who are indifferent to justice, merely for the sake of pleasure."
"I hope that you seek to conciliate by the following three means, viz. gifts, a
loving mind and polite words- the aged, the children and the foremost physicians."
"I hope you greet your teachers, the elderly, the ascetics, the deities; the
unexpected visitors, the trees standing at cross roads and all the brahmins of auspicious life and conduct."
"I hope you do not abrogate virtue by your excessive devotion to wealth or your
excessive devotion to wealth or your earthly interests by your over-emphasis on religion or both your religious and secular interests by your self-indulgence in pleasure, greed and gratification of the senses."
"I hope your pursue wealth, religion and the delights of the sense dividing them all according to time, O Jewel among the victorious, the one who is conversant with the proper time and O, the bestower of boons!"
"O, the one who is endowed with great wisdom! I hope that brahmins versed in the
knowledge of the scriptures, the inhabitants of town and the country pray for your happiness."
Do you eschew the following fourteen for of kings -viz. atheism, falsehood, anger
carelessness, procrastination, disregard of the wise, sloth, bondage to the five senses, himself alone devoting thought to the affairs of the state (without consulting the ministers); taking counsel with those of perverted insight; failure to undertake the projects already decided, failure to keep secrets, failure to utter auspicious words (at the beginning of an undertaking); and rising from one's seat (indiscriminately) to receive all.
"O, the very wise Bharata! I hope you understand the following and deal them
properly the ten evils; the five kinds of fortifications; the four expedients; the seven limbs of state; the eight evils (born of anger) the three objects of human pursuit; the three branches of learning subjugation of the senses, the six strategic expedients; adversity brought about by divine agencies; and by human agencies; the twenty types of monarches;
and the entire population of the kingdom, setting about an an expedition, drawing up an army in a battle-array and the two bases viz, peace and war.
"I hope that you consult with three or four ministers as mentioned in scriptures any proposal collectively and singly with each of them in secret."
"Do you find advantages in your study of Vedas? Are your acts, production of fair
results? Do you benefit from the company of your consorts? Has your learning been fruitful?"
"O, Bharata! I hope that your conviction, is the same as mentioned by me in the
foregoing verses, which is conducive to long life, fame, religious merit, enjoyment and wealth."
"Do you follow the common practice, which our fore fathers observed and which is in accord with the path of the virtuous and which is distinguished in itself."
"I hope you do not eat by yourself nicely made eatable and do you share it with your friends, who seek it?"
"A wise and learned king, having obtained and ruled the entire earth, properly by
righteousness and by administering justice to the people, indeed ascends to heaven when detached from the mortal body."Agitated to learn that Rama had arrived to Lanka and is stationed at Suvela 
			mountain along with his army, Ravana confers with his ministers and after dismissing them, 
			approaches Seetha with Vidyujjuha, knower of conjuring tricks. Informing Seetha that her 
			husband along with his army had been killed in battle, he produces before her an illusive 
			Rama's head along with bow and arrows created with Vidyujjuha's conjuring trick. Thus, Ravana 
			deceives Seetha about the death of Rama.
The spies of king Ravana informed him that Rama with his imperturbable army 
			was encamped at Mount Suvela in Lanka.
Hearing through his spies that Rama with his mighty army had arrived to Lanka, 
			Ravana was a little agitated and spoke to his counsellors as follows:
"The time for deliberation has come to us. Let our ministerial colleagues 
			come quickly with their keenly attentive minds."
As per his command, the ministers came instantly. Ravana conferred with the 
			ogres, his ministers.
The dreadful Ravana discussed about the ensuing things to be done immediately. 
			He sent away the ministers and entered his palace.
Thereafter, Ravana the practiser of conjuring tricks, took the exceedingly 
			strong Vidyujjihva who was a great sourcerer along with him and went to Seetha's place.
Ravana the lord of demons spoke to Vidyujjihva, who was a knower of conjuring 
			tricks as follows: "With your spells, create an illusion in order to deceive Seetha, daughter 
			of Janaka."
"O, demon! Produce a head resembling Rama's along with a great bow and arrows 
			created deceptively and present yourself before me."
Hearing Ravana's words, the demon Vidyujjihva said, "Be it so". He showed 
			to Ravana those things of his conjuring trick, well-performed. The king became satisfied 
			of his work and gave him an ornament (as a gift).
The exceedingly strong Ravana the suzerain lord of demons, duly entered the 
			Ashoka grove, eagerly longing for the sight of Seetha.
Then, Ravana the younger brother of Kubera ( the god of riches) saw Seetha 
			the unfortunate one, who did not deserve that fate, seated on the ground with her head bent 
			down in the Ashoka grove plunged in grief as she was and absorbed in the thought of her 
			husband.
Then, approaching Seetha who was attended upon by ghastly ogresses seated 
			not far distance from her and mentioning his own name with great delight, Ravana spoke the 
			following audacious words to Seetha.
"O, Beautiful one! He in whom you trusted and repelled me when I sought to 
			console you - that murderer of Khara, your husband Rama has been killed in battle."
"O, Seetha! Your root has been cut off in all ways by me and your pride has 
			been slain. By your present evil predicament, you will become my wife."
"O, Foolish one! Give up this resolution. What will you do with one dead. 
			O, beautiful one! Become the Chief Queen over all my consorts."
"O, Foolish one, with scant virtue and failed purpose! You think yourself 
			as wise! O, Seetha! Hear about the dreadful killing of your husband in battle, as the killing 
			of the demon Vritra (at the hands of Indra)"
"Rama, encircled by an extensive army led forward by Sugreeva, is said to 
			have arrived at the sea-shore, to kill me."
"While sun was going to set, Rama with his mighty army was encamped there, 
			encroaching upon the northern shore of the sea."
"Their army stationed there, comfortably asleep at the middle of the night 
			and completely fatigued in the course of the journey, was approached first and espied by 
			our spies."
"By my great army, which was led by Prahasta, Rama's army was killed in the 
			night at the place where Rama and Lakshmana were there."
The demons wielding harpoons, maces, discus, daggers, sticks, great arrows 
			spears, shining maces with spikes, picks lances, darts, massed weapons, clubs and circular 
			missiles, made use of them again and again in order to strike down the monkeys."
"The impetuous Prahasta, with his steady hand, severed the head of Rama sleeping 
			there, with his mighty sword without a resistance from any one."
"Fortunately, Vibhishana was over leaped and held captive. Lakshmana along 
			with the monkeys were made to run away in all directions."
"O, Seetha! Sugreeva the king of monkeys with his neck broken and Hanuman 
			with his jaw removed were laid down and killed by the demons."
"Thereafter Jambavan who was rising up on his knees was killed in the battle. 
			His body was cut off with many sharp-edged spears, like a tree is cut off."
"Mainda and Dvivida - those two great scourgers of their foes, the long bodied 
			and the foremost of the monkeys, groaning and breathless, their limbs bathed in blood-were 
			cut to pieces at the waist-level, by a sword."
"Panasa, crying for help was stretched on the earth under a tree of the same 
			name. Pierced by lying in a pit. The exceedingly valiant kumuda on his part, shrieking, 
			was killed by a hail of missiles."
"Angada, who was adorned with bracelets lies fallen down, emitting blood 
			on all sides, as he was pierced by the demons with many arrows, after approaching him."
"The monkeys sleeping there were crushed by elephants and multitude of chariots, 
			like clouds are crushed to pieces by the velocity of wind."
"The enemy fled in terror, pursued by demons, while being struck on the bak, 
			like lions pursuing great elephants."
"Some monkeys fell in the sea and some sought shelter in the sky. The bears 
			with the monkeys climbed the trees."
"By the demons with monstrous eyes, were killed a multitude of monkeys, at 
			the shores of the sea, in the mountains an in the woods."
"Thus, your husband together with his army was killed by my troops. This 
			head, drenched in his blood and besmeared with dust has been gathered up."
Thereafter, Ravana the Lord of demons who was very much difficult to be attacked, 
			spoke the following words to an ogress, while Seetha was overhearing them.
"Bring Vidyujjihva, the demon of the cruel deed, by whom himself Raghava's 
			head was brought back from the battle-field."
Holding that head along with a bow, Vidyujjihva making a respectful salute 
			with his head bent low, stood in front of Ravana.
Thereafter, the king Ravana spoke the following words to Vidyujjihva, the 
			demon who had a large tongue and who was standing and moving closely.
"Keep Rama's head immediately in front of Seetha. Let the miserable Seetha 
			see well the final condition of her husband.
Hearing Ravana's words, that demon deposited the cherished head in the vicinity 
			of Seetha and soon disappeared from the site.
"Here is Rama's bow famous in the three worlds!" - saying thus, Ravana threw 
			a great shining bow in front of Seetha.
"This is the bow with its cord stretched, belonging to Rama, that was brought 
			back by Prahasta here, after killing that hero in the night."
That Rama's head and bow on the ground in front of Seetha the illustrious 
			daughter of Janaka, saying: "You now become submissive to my desire."Rama, who was well acquainted with portents, on seeing the portents around, embraced
Lakshmana and spoke as follows:
"O, Lakshmana! Acquiring this region endowed with cold water and woods abounding in
fruits, let us speedily divide this multitude of forces into battalions and drawing it up in battle
array, we shall stand attentive."
"I perceive an impending danger which will be terrific, causing destruction to the
world, and torture to the eminent heroes among bears monkeys and demons."
"Winds are blowing with dust and earth is trembling. Mountain- tops are quivering
and trees are falling down."
"Ferocious clouds resembling wild beasts were dirty colored and emit a terrific
roaring and let loose dreadful showers mingled with drops of blood."
"Evening twilight resembling red sandal wood is very much dreadful. From the blazing
sun, balls of fire fall."
"Wild animals and birds from all sides are roaring pitiably with melancholic sound,
facing towards the sun in great fear."
"The splendorous moon as though rising at the time of universal dissolution,
invested with a black and red halo is tormenting the mind this night."
"O, Lakshmana! A dark stain appears on the cloudless solar disc, which is
diminished, dreary, inauspicious and coppery."
"O, Lakshmana! Look! Stars enveloped in enormous dust, appear to announce a
dissolution of the world."
"Crows, eagles and vultures are flying low. Jackals too are howling very dreadful
and inauspicious sounds."
"Earth will become a quagmire of flesh and blood, covered with rocks spears and
swords hurled by monkeys and demons."
"Abounding with all the monkeys we shall attack the city ruled by Ravana, now itself
at a quick pace."
Rama the lord, the conqueror of enemies and a charming man thus speaking, wielded a
bow and sallied forth in front, facing towards Lanka.
All those excellent monkeys, together with Vibhishana and Sugriva making roaring
sounds surged forth for the destruction of the audacious enemies.
Rama on his part was pleased by the act and gestures of those very strong monkeys,
with their intention to gratify him.
Hearing those mournful words relating to the death of his father, spoken by Bharata, Rama fainted away.
Hearing that unpleasant thunder bolt of words spoken by Bharata, like a thunderbolt released by Indra the Lord of celestials in a battle, Rama the tormentator of his enemies, stretched forth his hands and fell on the ground, in the same manner as a tree covered at extremities with blossoms was cut off by an axe in the forest.
Seeing Rama lying on the earth, has the lord of the earth, like an elephant crushed by a land slide on a bank where he was sleeping, those brother along with Seetha approached him from all sides and weepingly sprinkled water on him.
Coming to his senses again and tears falling from his eyes, Rama began to speak much plaintively.
Hearing that the King and his father had ascended to heaven, the virtuous. Rama
spoke the following words, consistent with righteousness to Bharata.
"What should I do with Ayodhya, now that my father reached the end of his life? Who will rule that Ayodhya, which is bereft of that excellent king?
"In my misfortune, what can I do for that high-souled one? He died of grief on my
account and I did not perform the last rites for him!"
"O, Bharata the faultless one! Alas! Happy are you, by whom as well as by Shatrughna the king was honoured by all obsequial rites!"
'Even after the end of my exile, I do not want to return to Ayodhya which is i a
disarranged state, deprived of a chief and made bereft of a king."
"O, Bharata the tormentator of foes While our father has gone to the other world,
who will counsel me when my exile in the forest is over?"
"Formerly, seeing my good conduct, our father used to address me in words of praise; from whom now shall I hear those words delightful to the ears?"
Having spoken thus to Bharata, Rama went to seek out his consort, whose face
resembled the full moon, and overwhelmed with grief, spoke to her as follows:-
"O, Seetha! your father-in-law is dead. O, Lakshmana! You have become bereft of your father. Bharata is informing a sorrowful news of the emperor being dead.
While Rama was uttering those words, copious tears caused to flow then from the eyes of those sons of Dasaratha.
Then, all those brothers consoled Rama very much and said to him, "Let us offer
libations of water for our father, the Lord of the earth."
Hearing that her father-in-law, that great monarch had ascended to heaven, Seetha
was unable to see her husband through eyes filled with tears.
Rama consoled that Seetha who was weeping and himself stricken with grief, spoke to the lamenting Lakshmana as follows:
"Bring the crushed pulp of Ingudi Tree and bring a piece of bark for being wrapped about my loins and another for being used as my loins and another for being used as an upper garment, so that we may proceed to offer libations of water for our magnanimous father."
"Let Seetha walk in the front and you follow after her nearby. I shall follow in the rear. This indeed is the most terrible procession.
Then, their faithful companion Sumantra versed in the spiritual science, endowed
with great intelligence, kind, self-controlled and glorious, and deeply devoted to Rama, consoling him and his brothers, took Rama by the hand and helped him descend to the auspicious River Mandakini.
The illustrious Rama and others painfully reached the River Mandakini, that stream of sacred fords, the enchanting one always covered with flowers, coming to a blessed ford, free from mud and offered the lustrual water to the king, saying "Father! May this prove agreeable to you."
Holding together in the form of a hollow his palms full of water and turning his
face turned towards the southern quarter and weeping the great prince pronounced the traditional words saying:
O, Tiger among men! May this water without taint and incorruptible at the moment
that I offer it to you, reach you in the region of your ancestors where you are."
Thereafter, the glorious Rama, resending the bank of Mandakini River along with his brothers, offered balls of food to his father.
Rama placed the pulp of the Ingudi tree mixed with the pulp of plums on a mat of
Kusa grass and overcome with sadness, weeping, spoke the following words:
"O, Great King! Be pleased to partake of this, which we eat for, that which man
eats, is also consumed by his gods."
Rama the tiger among men then re-ascending by the same path on the banks of the
river reached the charming summit of Chitrakuta mountain.
Gaining the door of his leafy hut, Rama the Lord of the earth then embraced Bharata and Lakshmana with his arms.
From the sound of the cry of those brothers with Seetha, which resembled like the
roaring of lions rose an echo in the mountain.
Hearing the tumultuous clamour by those mighty heroes as, weeping they completed the libations of water to their father, Bharata's army got alarmed.
Those troops of Bharata also said, "Assuredly, Bharata has joined Rama and this is a great sound only of their wailing, as they mourn for their dead father."
Leaving their tents all of them having but one thought, went running in the
direction of that sound instantly.
Some went on their horses, some others on their elephants, some in their chariots
covered with ornaments while the youthful people went on foot.
In their longing to see Rama, whose absence though recent, seemed so long a period for them, the whole people ran towards the hermitage.
Eager to see those brothers re-united there, they went hastily by various means of transport, either by hoofed animals or by wheeled vehicles.
Trodden by many vehicles, beasts and chariots, that land emitted a tumultuous noise, as a sky during the conjunction of clouds.
Frightened by that noise, the wild elephants, surrounded by female elephants,
perfuming the quarters with teh scent of their ichor, went to another wood from there.
Boars, wolves and lions, buffaloes, snakes, monkeys, tigers, Gokarnas and Gavayas
(two distinctive species of deer) along with spotted deer felt frightened.
The ruddy gooses, water-fowls, swans, Karandavas ( a sort of ducks), herons, male
cuckoos and cranes, utterly confused made it to various directions.
The sky filled with birds that had been frightened by that noise and the earth
covered with men, both looked beautiful at that moment.
Suddenly then, the people beheld the illustrious and the sinless Rama, sitting on
the bare earth.
Abusing Kaikeyi and Manthara, those people turned up with their faces bathed in
tears. while approaching Rama.
Seeing those people thus deeply afflicted their eyes suffused with tears, Rama
knowing what was right, embraced them like their father and mother.
Rama embraced some men there, while some others offered salutations to him.
Approaching them on that occasion, the king's son received them all including his friends and companions.
The tumult of those magnanimous persons lamenting, resounded over the earth and in the sky, reverberating through the mountain caves and in all quarters like the continuous beating of drums.A pitiable one, such as he is, he spoke to Lakshmana in a pitiable voice,
"Lakshmana, go quickly to River Godavari and find out whether Seetha has gone to Godavari to fetch
lotuses..." 
When Rama said thus to him Lakshmana again went to the charming River Godavari
quickening his pace. 
Searching at many declivities which River Godavari has on its banks Lakshmana said
to Rama, "I do not espy her at ghats, declivities of riverbanks, and she is not replying though I
shouted for her. 
"In fact, oh, Rama, to which place she that neutraliser of nervousness, namely
Vaidehi, has got round to, or where that frailty is, that place is really incomprehensible to me...

Rama who is already stupefied by anguish is now despaired on listening Lakshmana's
words and he personally went straight to River Godavari, and staying nearby that river Rama shouted
in this way, "Seetha... where are you?" 
The forest creatures which were asked earlier have not said to Rama that a
deservedly destructible demagogue of demons has divested him of Seetha, likewise now River Godavari
which is now being asked has not informed Rama about Seetha. 
Though the woeful Rama has asked her, and even though all the georgic beings
impelled her to inform Rama the fact about his ladylove, River Godavari then remained mouthless
about Seetha. 
She that River Godavari has not informed Rama about Vaidehi just out of fear on
recalling the mien and manoeuvres of malefic-minded Ravana, lest Ravana may drain her away.

Rama who is already in a rundown condition owing to the non-appearance of Seetha, is
further rendered as a hopeless being by River Godavari in the matter of his catching a glimpse of
Seetha, and such a Rama spoke to Saumitri. 
"Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply. In the
absence of Vaidehi, oh Lakshmana, really what is that unpleasant word I have to say to Vaidehi's
father king Janaka, also thus to Vaidehi's mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, when I meet them!

"Which Vaidehi is the remover of all my sadness who am a destitute of kingdom and
surviving in forests on forest produce, such as she is, where has she gone, really! 
"Though I am distanced from my relatives I deemed that princess Seetha alone would
be an evermore relative of mine. But now when that princess alone is unseen I deem that my
sleepless nights would be lengthy. 
"I will search all these places of Godavari, Janasthaana and this mountain with many
rapids, perhaps Seetha may be available somewhere. 
"Now all these burly animals are repeatedly looking at me as though to speak to me,
oh, brave Lakshmana, this I reckon with their body language as it were. 
But on seeing them pryingly that tigerly-man Raghava has indeed asked them at once
with a voice stifled with tears, "where is Seetha?" 
When that best king has asked, those animals rose to their feet in a trice and
facing themselves southward showed skyward with their snouts. And while running in the direction in
which Maithili is taken away they are stopping to look back at that lord of people, Rama. Thus they
are repeatedly running, stopping and staring at Rama. 
By which reason those animals are going in a southerly course on a southerly
terrain, and stopping to peer at Rama, and again clamorously adopting the very same southerly
course, Lakshmana ascertained that reason. 
On noticing the lingua franca and even the lingua persona of those animals, that
imaginative Lakshmana spoke to his elder brother, alike a striver striving hard for some
information. 
"Oh, godly brother, when you have asked these animals, 'where is Seetha,' they
quickly rose to their feet, and as to how they are showing the track on the ground and the southern
direction as well, thereby we may, for sure, go south-westward to know whether there is some
information about her, or else, even that noble lady herself may be available there..." 
On saying "Yes!" to Lakshmana that illustrious Rama of Kakutstha sallied forth to
southern direction followed by Lakshmana, scrutinising the earth on his walkway. 
Those two brothers who are proceeding while discussing among themselves have seen
the walkway bestrewn with flowers fallen from a person. 
That valiant Rama who is anguished to see the drizzle of flowers fallen on the
surface of earth spoke this word to Lakshmana who is equally anguished. 
"I recognise these flowers that are fallen here, oh, Lakshmana. In forest I gave
them to Vaidehi and she tucked these very flowers in her bun. 
"These flowers are carefully safeguarded by the sun, as they are unwithered yet, by
air as they are unswept by it, and by the glorious earth, as they are unspoilt by that, thus I deem
that these naturals, sun, air, and earth are really proffering a helping hand to me. 
On saying thus to best one among men Lakshmana, that virtue-souled and dextrous Rama
asked the mountain that is uproarious with rapids. 
"Oh, lord among the earth-bolstered mountains, have you somehow seen a beauty by all
her limbs, foregone by me in beautiful woodlands?" 
Reply of mountain to Rama:"Oh, lordly bolsterer of
earth, lord Rama, I have somehow seen a beauty by all her limbs, foregone by you in beautiful
woodlands.'
Because his question is unanswered he is enraged as with a lion enraging at a puny
animal, and then he spoke to the mountain, "show me that golden tinged, golden limbed Seetha, oh,
mountain, no sooner than I devastate all your apices, apiece..." 
When Rama spoke to the mountain in this way, that mountain echoed as if it is
revealing Seetha, but actually it has not revealed Seetha to Raghava. 
Then Rama of Dasharatha said to the hefty mountain, "When the infernos of my arrows
will burn you down completely and when you will be pared down ashes, you shall be grassless,
treeless and tender-leafless, and thus you become a meritless mountain... hence, show Seetha before
becoming so... 
"Lakshmana, if this River Godavari is not going to tell me immediately about that
moonshine-faced Seetha, now I will dry her up... 
This way when Rama is highly infuriated and who appeared to burn down anything just
with his eyes, then he has seen on the ground gigantic footprints of a demon, and the footprints of
Vaidehi, who appeared to have run fearfully here and there in a helter-skelter manner expecting the
arrival of Rama, and which footprints are heavily trodden by a demon who followed her. 
On scrutinising the overly trodden footprints of Seetha and the demon, and a broken
bow, broken quiver, and broken and variously bestrewn chariot also, then Rama became baffle-hearted
and said to his dear brother Lakshmana. 
"See Lakshmana, many beads of jewellery and many bits of garlands of Vaidehi have
indeed fallen down, and oh, Soumitri, they are strewn around... 
"Also the surface of the earth is everywhere interspersed with big and small blood
drops that are akin to golden droplets, you see them Saumitri... 
"I think Lakshmana, guise changing demons would have ripped and rived Vaidehi, or
divided her into pieces, or they might have gluttonised her. 
"A deadly clash has occurred here, Soumitri, while two demons were clashing between
themselves on account of Vaidehi... 
"Oh, gentle Lakshmana, studded with pearls and gems this great bow of someone is
beautifully decorated, but it is fragmented and fallen to earth. Oh, dear boy, Lakshmana, this bow
may perhaps belong to demons, or else to gods... 
"Studded with lapis gem beads this golden armour of someone is similar to the rising
sun in its shine, but it is splintered and fallen to earth... 
"This hundred-spoked regal-parasol of someone is embellished with divine festoons,
but oh, gentle Lakshmana, its central-shaft is wrecked and it is felled to earth... 
"These ghost-faced mules with golden breastplates are macabre in form and massive in
frame, but they are hewed down in war, whose are they, either... 
"Somebody's combat-chariot is irradiant and similar in shine to the flaring fire
with a war-pennon, but it is broken and battered down, as well... 
"These frightful looking arrows of somebody are gilded and they are as much as a
chariot's axle in their thickness, but their arrowheads are shred and they are manifoldly shredded
and strewn around... 
"Lakshmana, you see these two quivers packed with arrows are completely shattered,
and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles still in his hands... whose charioteer he
might be! 
Lakshmana, you see... these two armours, one belonging to the combatant from this
chariot  and the other belonging
to this charioteer, both are encrusted fully with arrows  thus the two armours are
completely shattered... and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles in his hand... either
he... whose is he... and where is the presiding combatant of this chariot....
"Evidently this is the modus operandi of someone who is a male demon, and you see
how my animosity has become hundredfold to eradicate them... 
"The highly stony-hearted demons that are guise-changers by their wish have either
abducted, or killed or gluttonised saintly Seetha... but, they say that rectitude saves such
saintly persons... yet that rectitude has not saved Seetha while she is being abducted in great
forest... 
"Whether Vaidehi is taken away or taken in by some unknown being, oh, gentle
Lakshmana, then who are the gods who can possibly be benignant to me in this world... 
"Lakshmana, someone, even if He were a Creator of Worlds, or an Omnipotent, if He
were to be lenient at heart or in His actions, He will be disrespected by all beings, owing to the
unenlightenment of those beings... 
"I who am mellowly, magnanimous, merciful and yoked only to the wellbeing of all
worlds, such as I am, all of the heavenly gods deem me as non-Omnipotent... it is definite...

"Have you seen Lakshmana how merits like mercifulness, magnanimity and the like are
inverted to become demerits on getting at me, thus I am unmerited in forgoing Seetha. As such, as
with the sizzle of sun uprisen quelling all the moonshine, now you may see as to how my irradiance
radiates quelling all the merits like softness and fairness for the nonentity of all beings
proactive to demons, inclusive of demons. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, will the yaksha-s be comfortable now, no; gandharva-s - no; monsters
- no; demons - no; either kinnaraa-s or humans - no, none can be comfortable henceforth...

"Now the welkin will be packed with my arrows and missiles, and I will render it as
an impassable sphere for the treaders in the triad of worlds... 
"I will make the triad of worlds quiescent by completely blockading all the
planetary bodies. The night-maker moon will be barricaded, aurae of fire, air and sun will be
devastated, and then everything will be overcast with darkness. Mountaintops will be completely
pulverised, water receptacles will be dried out, and trees, creeping-plants and shrubberies will be
destroyed, and oceans depleted, thus I will bring the triad of the worlds to nought, relative to
the task of Time in extinguishing an era... 
"If the gods are not going to safely restore Seetha to me, oh, Soumitri, they can
see what my blitzkrieg is, at this very moment... 
"All beings cannot fly high in the sky, oh, Lakshmana, as there will be a labyrinth
of my arrows released from my bowstring, minus an intercolumniation... 
"Bombarded with my iron-shafts this world will be put to disorderliness, Lakshmana,
you may now witness how the animals and birds will be dazed and devastated... 
"Because of Maithili I will render this mortal world de-demonical, de-phantasmal by
force-stretching my unstoppable arrows up to my ears to release them forcefully... 
"Let the gods witness now the impact of the blaze-crested, thoroughgoing arrows of
mine, projected by my wrath and released by my irascibility... 
"That being so, when the triad of worlds is completely ruined by my anger will there
be gods, no; demons - no; phantoms - no, none can survive... 
"Whatever worlds of gods, or monsters, or even those of demons are there, they will
be splintered and falling down apiece by the fusillades of my arrows... 
"Whether she is abducted, or even if she is killed, oh, Soumitri, if the gods are
not going to give back my Seetha I will now jeopardise these worlds with my arrows... 
"If my ladylove is not returned indeed in a fine fettle as she was before my running
after Golden Deer, I will be annihilating the triad of world in its entirety, together with its
mobile and sessile beings, and I will be sweltering the entire universe with my arrows as long as I
am not going to get a glimpse of her." Thus Rama gave a vent to his feelings. 
Rama on saying thus with his eyes reddening in fury, his lappet-fold of lips jerking
spasmodically, he girded up his jute-cloths and deerskin and twined up the mass of his matted-hair.

When the disposition of that venturesome and infuriated Rama has become in that way
holocaustic, it is like that of Rudra, the All-Inflamer god, when He became like this in earlier
times, intending to inflame the Triple-Cities. 
On saying so that illustrious Rama, the delighter of world, grabbed his bow from
Lakshmana and gripped it tightly, unholstered a deadly and dazzling arrow from his quiver which is
like a poisonous serpent, and readying it on the bowstring of his bow, that Rama, the vanquisher of
enemies fastnesses, who looked like the Ear-End-Fire, spoke this sentence. 
"As to how all the created beings cannot counteract the ageing, dying, fate and the
Time at anytime, likewise I too am non-countervailed, when I am coalesced with fury, no doubt about
it..." 
"If that princess of Mithila, who has suavely and toothy smiles and who causes
irreproachability to my character if only I can have a glimpse of her, is not returned to me in
fine fettle as she was when she was with me, then I will countermove whole of this universe
together with its gods, immortals, humans, florae and faunas, mountains and waters... and
whatnot... Rama, a very bright man and a true warrior, having duly heard the words of Hanuman from 
the beginning, thereafter spoke as follows:
"I shall destroy quickly Lanka, the city of that terrible ogre (Ravana), of which you 
just informed I am really telling this."
"Be pleased to approve our march at this moment, a suitable moment for success. The sun 
reached the mid-day.
"Let that ogre go (to his abode) after kidnapping Seetha. Where will he go alive? Hearing 
of my march to Lanka, Seetha will get back her hope in life, like a sick man having drunk poison touches 
ambrosia at the end of his life."
"This northern planet of Phalguni will be in conjunction with the Hasta star tomorrow. 
Hence, let us depart today itself with all the troops accompanying us, Oh, Sugreeva!"
"By seeing the omens which are becoming visible, I deduce that I shall bring back Seetha 
the daughter of Janaka, by killing Ravana."
"My eye which is twitching on the upper lid, is proclaiming as it were, my desire of 
victory coming nearer."
Then Rama the virtuous man versed in moral law, who was well-adored by Sugreeva the king 
of monkeys and Lakshmana, again spoke as follows:-
"Let general Nila accompanied by strength of hundred thousand warriors go before the 
army, to explore the way."
"Oh Nila the chief of Army! Steer the army speedily by the path, abound with fruits and 
roots, cool woods and fresh water and honey."
"The evil-minded demons may spoil the roots, fruits and water in the path-way. You always 
try to be on you guard."
"Let the monkeys jump into law grounds, into places made inaccessible by forest-grores 
and into thickets and notice whether any rival forces are stationed there."
"Let whatever little of feeble forces stay back in Kishkindha, as our operation will 
indeed be dreadful. It has to be discharged daringly."
"Let the best of monkeys with great strength in hundreds and thousands lead the formidable 
of the army, which is akin to an oceanic stream."
"Let Gaja, equal to a mountain, Gavaya a very strong warrior and Gavaksha march in front, 
as a majestic bull marches in front of a cow-herd."
"Let the monkey called Rishabha, Lord of the simians and the best of the primates march 
forward, duly guarding the right side of the army of the simians."
"Let Gandhamadana, with a strength unconquerable like an elephant in rut, proceed duly 
guarding the left side of the army of monkeys."
"I myself, mounted on the shoulders of Hanuman, like Indra on Airavata, will march in 
the centre of my troops, duly cheering the multitude of army."
"Let this Lakshmana, resembling the lord of Death, march on the shoulders of Angada like 
Kubera the lord of riches and the sovereign of beings marches on an elephant called Sarvabhauma."
Let the highly strong, Jambavan with Sushena and the monkey called Vegadarshi, all three, 
guard the middle part of the army."
"Hearing the words of Rama, Sugreeva with great valour, the commander of forces and the 
lion among monkeys gave orders to the monkeys accordingly."
Then, all those troops of monkeys with great speed together raised up and quickly bounced 
from caves and mountain-tops.
Thereafter Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved 
towards southern direction, along with the army.
At that time, Rama went surrounded by monkeys, looking like elephants, numbering in hundreds, 
hundreds of thousands and crores.
That extensive army of monkeys followed Rama who was marching in the lead. All those 
monkeys maintained by Sugreeva were rejoicing with delight.
The monkeys, jumping overwhelmingly with roaring sound and jest fully playing musical 
instruments (like trumpets) marched towards southern direction.
They marched on, eating good-smelling honeys and fruits and carrying large branches bearing 
clusters of blossoms in multitude.
Wild monkeys would lift up and throw one another all of a sudden. Some others were hanging 
down and flying upwards. Some other monkeys were throwing down others.
Monkeys close to Rama were thus shouting, "To us, Ravana is worthy of killing and also 
the entire demons."
Rishabha, Nila, and the courageous Kumuda along with many monkeys were clearing up the 
path ahead.
Sugreeva the king of monkeys, Rama and Lakshmana the destroyers of enemies were moving 
in the centre along with many robust and terrible monkeys.
The heroic monkey satabali who was accompanied by ten crores of monkeys, standing alone 
firmly, guarded the whole army of monkeys.
Kesari with a retinue of a hundred crore, Panasa, Gaja and Arka along with many monkeys 
were protecting one flank of that army.
Keeping Sugreeva in front, Sushena and Jambavanta surrounded by many bears, protected 
the hinder part of that army.
Nila their chief of the army, the brave and the best among monkeys, the self controlled 
and the foremost among movable beings, was protecting atha army in every direction.
Valimukha, Prajangha, Jambha and Rabhasa the monkey were moving on all sides, urging 
the monkeys forward.
Those foremost among the monkeys, proud of their strength, thus marching with the army, 
saw the Sahya mountain the best of mountains joined with many small mountains, lakes fully abounding 
in flowers and eminent ponds.
That large army of monkeys, terrific like an ocean-flood cognizing the command of Rama 
which is frightfully enraging, having terror-stricken, abandoning the vicinity of towns and even villages, 
marched like a highly dreadful ocean with a great hoaring sound.
All those prominent and valiant monkeys were overwhelmingly jumping ahead, like fine 
horses being whipped, at the side of that Rama.
Rama and Lakshmana the best among men being carried on shoulders by Hanuman and Angada 
the two monkeys, were effulgent like the moon and the sun having come together in contact with two large 
planets (Jupiter and Venus).
Thereafter, Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved 
towards southern direction, along with the army. Lakshmana, with a fully meaningful presence of mind, 
sitting on Angada, spoke the following auspicious words which were fully meaningful, to Rama.
"Killing Ravana fast and obtaining Seetha who was taken away, you will proceed to Ayodhya 
which is abundant by rich, having accomplished your purpose."
"I am seeing all grand good omens in the sky and the earth self-evident of your fulfillment, 
Oh Rama! The wind which is favorable, gentle beneficial and comfortable to the army is blowing alongside."
"These beasts and birds are uttering sonorous and sweet sounds. All the quarters are 
looking bright. Even the sun is clear."
"The planet of Venus with its bright light, born from the sage Bhrigu (a mind-born son 
of Brahma the creator) is hanging behind you. Dhruva, the very bright pole-star (which is recognized 
by the contiguity of the stars presided over by the seven Brahmana sages) is becoming clear. All the 
pure great sages having bright light are shining are shining around Dhruva star.
"The royal sage Trishanku, our paternal grand father, born in the high-souled Ikshvaku 
dynasty, is purely shining (as a star) in front, along with his family-priest."
"Visakha stars are shining clearly without any evil influence. This supreme constellation 
is of our Ikshvakus, the high-souled."
"The Mula constellation of the titans is badly aspected, in that it is touched by a comet 
risen with a tail of light and tormented by it."
"All this has come for the destruction of the titans, for, the star seized by death is 
oppressed by a planet in its last hour."
"The waters are crystal-clear, with good taste. The woodlands are laden with fruit. The 
fragrant air is not blowing much. Trees are bearing seasonal flowers."
"The armies of monkeys formed into different squadrons are looking highly splendid like 
the armies of celestials in the battle in which the demon Taraka was killed, Oh venerable one! Be pleased 
to see these good omens in this manner."
The delighted Lakshmana spoke thus, cheering up his brother. Then, the army of monkeys 
consisting of excellent bears and monkeys having their very nails and teeth as weapons, marched ahead, 
covering the entire earth.
The aweful dust raised by nails and claws of monkeys obscured the splendor of the sun 
and also covered the earth comprising of mountains forests and the atmosphere. The colossal monkey-army 
advanced, encompassing the southern region like a mass of cloud enveloping the sky.
While the army was crossing the entire river-currents uninterruptedly, the currents flowed 
invertedly for a distance of many yojanas.
The mighty army entered thoroughly into lakes containing clear water, mountains full 
of trees, plain-landed territories and forests laden with fruits from the middle, from the four sides, 
from across and from under.
The gigantic army marched, thoroughly covering the land. All of them with a wind-like 
aped went on, manifesting a joy in their faces.
For the sake of Rama, the monkeys with fully elevated pace vied with each other in high 
spirits, vigor and prowess. Out of pride born of prime youth, some made various gestures on the way.
Some wild monkeys there walked very speedily. In that manner, some others hovered highly. 
Some made noises, sounding "kila! kila!".
Some monkeys lashed their tails. Some even stamped their feet. Some others, stretching 
their arms, broke off rocks and trees.
Some monkeys ascended mountain-peaks and uttered huge noises. Some others made lion's 
roars.
Some monkeys were crushing many webs of creepers by the jerks of their thighs. The valiant 
monkeys also played with rocks and trees, by stretching their limbs.
In that place, the land was covered splendidly by hundreds of thousands, by thousands 
and crores of monkeys, who were looking very dreadful.
That extensive monkey-army was marching day and night. All the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva 
were exceedingly pleased and cheerful. All were marching quickly, rejoicing for war. Those monkeys desirous 
of Seetha's release, did not halt even for a moment anywhere.
Then, those monkeys reached and climbed up a mountain called sahya with a full canopy 
of trees and filled with many kinds of beasts.
Rama too went along, seeing the wonderful woods, streams and cascades of Sahya and Malaya 
mountains.
The monkeys enjoyed the fruits of Champaka, Tilaka, mango, Praseka, Sindnvaara Timisa 
and Karaveera trees.
Various kinds of forest-trees standing on enchanting plateaus, being shaken by gust of 
winds, poured out flowers on those monkeys.
A soft-touching breeze, refreshing as a sandal, blew while the bees hummed in the nectar-scented 
woods.
That royal Sahya Mountain was highly adorned with red-coloured metal. The dust blown 
from that metal by the velocity of wind, coming forth from all sides, obscured the huge monkey-army.
On the lovely mountain slopes, in blossom on all sides, Ketaki and Sindhuvara trees, 
the charming Vasanti, Madhavi creepers with flowers full of scent, clumps of jasmine, Chiribila, Madhuka, 
Vanjula and Vakula, Ranjanka and Tilaka, Nyavriksha all in flower, Mango, Patalike, Kovidara in flower, 
Muchulinda, Arjuna, Simsapa and Kutaja, Hintala, Timisa, Chirna and Nipa, blue Ashoka, Sarala, Ankola 
and Padmaka all these trees were crawled in excitement by the monkeys who were delighted.
There were delightful wells with stairs and ponds in that mountain, sought after by chakravaka 
birds, frequented by karandava birds, crowded with water-fowls and cranes, visited by boars and deer, 
haunted on all sides by bears, hyenas, lions and many dreadful tigers. There were beautiful reservoirs 
of water with blossoming blue lotuses, water lilies, white water lilies, black water lilies and various 
other kinds of aquatic flowers.
Various kinds of birds sang in those mountain-peaks. Monkeys bathed in water, drank those 
waters and played. They ascended the mountain and got drenched in water, by sprinkling water by one 
over the other among themselves.
Monkeys in mad rut plucked sweet-smelling fruits, roots and flowers there.
Those monkeys, in reddish brown colour like honey, drinking honey from honey-combs weighing 
about a maund each, went on cheerfully.
Those foremost among the monkeys marched, breaking off trees, pulling along creepers 
and throwing away excellent mountains.
Some other monkeys, well-pleased with honey got from trees, yelled loudly. Some others 
reached trees to get honey. Some others were drinking honey excessively.
The earth filled with those excellent monkeys, was like land filled with ripened fields 
of paddy.
Then, the lotus-eyed and the mighty-armed Rama reached Mahendra mountain and ascended 
its top, adorned with trees.
Then, Rama the son of Dasartha mounted the peak and saw an ocean ruffled with water and 
scattered well with turtles and fishes.
They crossed Sahya mountain and Malaya mountain and systematically approached the ocean 
having terrific sound.
Rama the foremost of those who entrance the mind, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana 
quickly descended the mountain and went to the excellent woodland adjoining the sea.
Then Rama reached the extensive ocean with rocks underneath washed by floods of water 
risen vehemently and spoke these words.
"Oh, Sugreeva! We have reached the abode of Varuna. We should consider now the matter 
(of how to cross the ocean) with which we were formerly preoccupied."
"This ocean, the lord of Rivers, is shore less beyond. This sea is impossible to be crossed 
without a proper strategy."
"For this reason, let the military be assembled here only. Here, let us discuss the plan 
how this military of monkeys will reach the other shore."
Rama, the mighty armed, emaciated due to taking away of Seetha, then reached the sea 
and ordered thus for the halt of the army there.
"Let all the army be stationed at the sea-shore, Sugreeva! Here, the time has come for 
us to think about the subject of crossing the ocean."
"Let not anyone slip away in any direction, leaving his respective unit of army. Let 
valiant monkeys make a more and it should be known whether there is a hidden danger for us."
Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva along with Lakshmana made the army to halt at the sea-shore, 
stretched with trees.
That army, stationed at the vicinity of the ocean, shined like a second ocean splendid 
with yellowish white honey-coloured water.
There, those foremost of monkeys reached the woodlands at the shore and settled down, 
desiring to reach the other shore of the vast sea.
While all the monkeys were halting there, the noise created out of their movement was 
dominantly heard, concealing the roar of the sea.
That army of the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva, stationed as three divisios (viz. 1. bears 
2. long tailed monkes and 3. monkeys) looked fully dedicated to the cause of Rama.
That army of monkeys reached the mighty ocean and was delighted to behold the mighty 
ocean being diffused by the velocity of wind.
Seeing the sea, the abode of Varuna, which was boundless and having the opposite shore 
far off, inhabitd by a number of demons, the monkey-troups sat down there.
Rendered appalling by the ferocity of fierce alligators and crocodiles, that ocen with 
its foaming waves at the end of the day and at the beginning of the night, appeared to laugh and dance.
The ocean surged, when the moon rose. The image of moon was reflected limitlessly in 
it. The sea was full of huge alligators swift as fierce winds along with whales and great fish.
That sea, the abode of Varuna was filled with serpents bestowed with flaming hoods, plunged 
with mighty aquatic creatures, abounding in various types of mountains, too difficult to cross, with 
an inaccessible path, suffocationly fathomless and an abode of demons.
Increasing waves of the sea in which sharks and bodies of serpents swarmed, rose and 
fell whipped into motion by the breeze.
Emitting whirled sparkles, shining with large water-snakes, a fearful abode of enemies 
of gods forever, the sea reaches upto the uneven Patala (subterranean region).
The ocean looked like the sky. The sky looked like the ocean. The ocean and the sky looked 
alike without any distinction.
The water blended with sky and the sky blended with water. Filled with stars above and 
the pearls below, both the sky and the sea looked with the same splendour.
There was no distinction between the two, of the sea filled with a row of waves and of 
the sky with a row of falling clouds.
The waves of the ocean together banging one another with a terrific resonance, sounded 
like a kettle-drum in the sky.
Those high-souled monkeys saw the sea lashed with winds, resonating with abundance of 
precious stones and water, rising high as if enraged in a grip of hurricane, filled with a number of 
aquatic creatures and tossed by them in the air by seemingly murmuring waves.
The standing monkeys were struck with amazement to see the ocean seemed moving, full 
of resonance produced by a multitude of dashing waves rolling to and fro.
Sugreeva expressly broached the topic of searching Seetha with Hanuma, as Sugreeva is decidedly determined about 
Hanuma, because that best one among monkeys, namely Hanuma, alone is decidedly the achiever of purpose. 
The king of all the residents of the forest Sugreeva is well pleased to pick and choose Hanuma for the purpose, and 
spoke to the venturesome son of Air-god, Hanuma. 
"Oh, foremost monkey, Hanuma, I do not foresee any impediment in your transit on land where homogenous enemies 
will usually obstruct one another, or in high skies where there is no foothold, thus only birds and clouds hover 
there, or in the wild blue yonder where celestial bodies alone gravitate at random, nor in waters where there 
is no underwater movement for earthly beings, nor in the heaven, the abodes of immortals, where those immortals 
will not allow mortals like us to meander as we like. 
"All the worlds that contain demons, Gandharva-s, naga-s, humans, gods, and the oceans and mountains therein 
are known to you. 
"With your unusual mobility, unstoppable celerity, unremitting vivacity, and untold ability you are identical 
to your father Maaruti, the Air-god of marvelling dynamism. 
"Or even by your radiancy, none on earth is coming to mind who can be a coequal of yours, thereby you alone shall 
think about that process as to how to access Seetha. 
"Oh, Hanuma, in you alone there are brawniness, astuteness and venturesomeness, and oh, ethicist, you conduct 
yourself in abidance with time, place and ethicality." Thus Sugreeva said to Hanuma. 
Raghava started ponderation when he was cognisant of the entrustment of the task to Hanuma and on cognising Hanuma 
as an efficient cause. 
"This king of monkeys, Sugreeva, is anywise definitive in his resolve reposed in Hanuma, and Hanuma is definitely 
resolute in achieving the task. 
"For that reason, Hanuma must have a good track record of the tasks he accomplished earlier, besides, he is specifically 
chosen by his king. As such, this Hanuma will certainly bring the task to fruition.
"This Sugreeva is well aware of each individual's accomplishments and hence he specifically chose Hanuma, and 
Hanuma who is now transiting must be individually well-known for the accomplishment of any task assigned to him. Hence 
the fruition of the task is certain." Thus, Rama pondered. 
On perusing Hanuma who is the ablest one in his endeavours, the highly resplendent Rama is immensely delighted, 
and his heart and senses are elated as if his purpose has been achieved. 
Then that enemy-inflamer Rama happily gave his ring that is shining forth with his name engraved as a sign to 
Hanuma, as a remembrancer for Princess Seetha. 
"By this emblematic ring, oh, best monkey, Janaka's daughter Seetha identifies you to have reached her from my 
proximity, without apprehension. 
"Oh, brave one, your enthusiasm, vital force combined with your venturesomeness, and also the message of Sugreeva 
to you, are as if a heralding achievement to me." Thus, Rama spoke to Hanuma while giving him his ring. 
On taking the ring that foremost monkey Hanuma kept on his head, and making palm-fold he reverenced the 
feet of Rama, and then that noteworthy monkey started. 
That brave monkey-son of Air-god leapt to the sky along with that massive force of monkeys as if he was hauling them 
up, and he who is brightened by monkeys around him on the skyscape appeared like the moon in a very clear lunar 
sphere on a cloudless sky brightened by clusters of stars around. 
"Oh, highly powerful Hanuma, I rely upon your vivacity, being the best venturesome monkey, oh, son of Air-god, 
showing your adventures that are not inconsequential you make happen as to how access can be gained to Janaka's 
daughter, Seetha." Thus, Rama shouted at Hanuma flying in the sky. Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh.
Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying;
"This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire."
While Rama was thus sitting there the dust and clamour of Bharata's army, which was approaching, ascended into the sky.
Meanwhile, frightened by that gigantic clamour, the leaders of elephants and other animal - troops, in rut, were tormented and fled in different directions from there.
Rama heard that sound generated from the army and also saw all those leaders of the animal-flock, running away from there.
Seeing those animals running away and hearing that clamour, Rama spoke to Lakshmana(son of Sumitra) of burning courage as follows:
"Alas! O, Lakshmana! Sumitra is blessed with a noble son in you. Here is heard a
tumultuous sound as terrific as that of a roaring cloud. See what it is."
"The lordly elephants in the forest, the buffaloes in the great woods and the wildbeasts frightened by lions are suddenly running away in various directions."
"O, Lakshmana! You ought to find out whether it is a king or a prince roaming for ahunt or some other savage beast."
"O, Lakshmana! This mountain is difficult of access even to birds. You ought to find out soon, all this in an accurate manner."
Lakshmana quickly ascended a Sala tree in flowering and looking towards all
directions, saw towards eastern side.
Looking in northern direction, Lakshmana saw a huge army, full of chariots, steeds and elephants accompanied by smart foot-soldiers.
Lakshmana informed Rama about that army which was full of horses, elephants and
chariots decorated with flags and spoke the following words also.
"O, honourable brother! Extinguish the fire. Let Seetha occupy a hiding place. Make your bow ready with a bow-string and arrows. Wear an armour."
Rama the tiger among men replied to Lakshmana, saying: "O, Lakshmana! See, whose
army do you think is this?"
Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana was irritated like a fire and spoke the following
words, as though he was wishing to scorch the army.
"Bharata, Kaikeyi's son, having obtained coronation and desirous of making the
kingdom free of enemies, is coming here to kill both of us. It is clear."
"The gigantic and glorious tree with superb branches is shining over there
prominently. The ensign bearing the device of a kovidara (pomegranate) tree is shining on that chariot."
Among the cavalry, some are cavorting merrily on their swift horses, while others
are beaming with delight, mounted on their elephants.
"O, warrior! Let us take up our bows and ascend the mountain or let us stay here
itself, fully prepared with our weapons in our hands."
"O, Rama! Will that flag with the insignia of a Kovidara tree come into our
subjugation? Can we see Bharata, because of whom a great misfortune has occurred to you, to Seetha and to me?"
"O, Rama the warrior! By the reason of whom you were deprived of an eternal kingdom, such Bharata as a foe who is coming here, deserves to be slain by me."
"O, Rama! I see no sin in slaying Bharata. None is charged with unlawfulness, if one strikes down an aggressor."
"Bharata is the assailant and his death is legitimate. He being dead, you will rule the entire earth."
"Let Kaikeyi, who is craving for the kingdom see, with great sorrow, her son slain by me today in battle, as a tree is crushed down by an elephant."
"I shall kill Kaikeyi too along with her friend the hunch-back and other
accomplices. Let the earth today be relieved of a great sinner."
"O, warrior bestowing an honour! Today in the concentrated fury that injustice has kindled I shall scatter the enemy - battalions as a fire consumes the dry wood."
"Today, with my sharpened arrows, I shall slay the bodies of my foes and make this forest of Chitrakuta overflow with blood."
"The elephants and horses whose breasts were laid open with my darts and the men too struck down by me, be dragged about by savage beasts."
"By killing Bharata together with his army in this great forest, I shall discharge my debt to my bow and arrows."Thereupon, Matali refreshed the memory of Rama as follows: "O the valiant one! Why
are you still carrying out the battle with Ravana as though you are unaware (of how to dispose of
him)?
"O lord! You can employ a mystic missile presided over by Brahma the lord of
creation. The time for his destruction has come now, as expressed by the celestials."
Then, the valiant Rama, who was reminded thus by Matali, took hold of a blazing
arrow, which was given by Brahma and which in turn was given to him by the glorious sage, Agastya
earlier in the battle-field and which looked like a hissing serpent.
Having been made formerly for Indra, the lord of celestials by Brahma, the lord of
creation of infinite strength, it was bestowed in the past on the ruler of gods, who was desirous
of conquering the three worlds.
In its feathers, wind was established. In its end-point were the fire and the sun.
In its heaviness were Mounts Meru and Mandara. Its shaft was made of ether.
Provided with good shaft decked with gold, the arrow which had its body shining, had
been made up of the efficacy of all the elements and an illuminating power of the sun.
Blazing like a fire at the time of universal dissolution enveloped in smoke and
looking like a venomous snake, it was swift in action and capable of bursting hosts of men,
elephants and horses.
It broke gate-ways, iron bars, and even mountains. Smeared witht he blood of various
victims and quoted with their marrow, it presented a very terrific appearance.
That arrow had an efficacy of a thunder bolt, loud-sounding, tearing off armies of
adversaries in many battles and creating fear to all, like a hissing serpent.
It was giving perennial feed to vultures, eagles, cranes, troops of jackals and
demons in the battle-field, possessing a form of Yama the lord of Death and was fearful.
That arrow bestowed joy on the monkey-leaders and destroyed the demons. It was made
speedy, by tying various kinds of beautiful coloured feathers of Garuda, the king of eagles, to
it.
Making it sacred by a special formula as per the procedure specified in scriptures,
Rama who was endowed with an extraordinary strength then fixed that arrow which was the foremost
among the three worlds, capable of removing the fear of Ikshwaku dynasty, taking away the glory of
the enemies and bestowing joy to one's own self on his bow.
While that excellent arrow was being fixed by Rama, all the beings were frightened
and the earth trembled.
That enraged Rama, stretching his bow well and with an attentive mind, hurled that
arrow which can tear off the vitals, towards Ravana.
That arrow, which was inviolable as a thunderbolt hurled by the arms of Indra and
irresistible as Yama the lord of Death, fell upon Ravana's chest.
That arrow, released with great speed and which was capable of destroying the body,
tore off the heart of that evil-minded Ravana.
That arrow, which was capable of causing death to the body, after taking away the
life of Ravana and having been anointed with blood, penetrated the earth.
Smeared with blood on having killed Ravana and thereby accomplishing its mission,
that arrow re-entered its own quiver (of Rama) silently.
From the hands of the slain Ravana, who was being separated from his life, fell his
bow with its arrows (fitted to it), at the same time coinciding indeed with his life-breath.
Having lost his life, that king of demons for his part, who was endowed with
terrible swiftness and invested with great splendour, fell down from the chariot to the ground ,
like Vritra the demon when the latter was struck down by the thunderbolt.
Seeing Ravana fallen down on earth, the surviving demons whose king had been killed,
were panic stricken and ran away to all sides.
The monkeys, who fought with trees, fell upon the demons from all sides. Seeing the
killing of Rvana, the monkeys assumed a triumphant appearance.
Tormented by the monkeys, the demons rushed back with panic towards Lanka, with
faces looking miserable and tears flowing down, their supporter having been killed.
Roaring shouts of joy, quite rejoiced as they were, and proclaiming Rama's victory
and the killing of Ravana in his hands, the monkeys behaved like conquerors.
Then the cheerful kettle-drum of the gods reverberated in the sky. Very pleasant
winds, carrying divine odour, blew there.
Pouring over the chariot of Rama quite fascinating shower of flowers, which was
difficult to be accomplished (elsewhere), fell from the heavens to the earth on that occasion.
Excellent pronouncements of the great-souled gods saying "well done! Bravo!",
combined with a panegyric in praise of Rama, was distinctly heard in the sky.
When Ravana, the cruel demon and the terror of all the worlds, was killed, a great
rejoice filled the hearts of gods and charanas the celestial bards.
Having been pleased with the killing of Ravana, Rama then fulfilled the desire of
Sugreeva, Angada and Vibhishana.
Then, troops of celestials got their mental peace. All the quarters were brightened
up and the sky became clear. The earth did not tremble. The wind blew gently. The sun too shed a
steady light.
Rejoiced with the victory in battle, Sugreeva, Vibhishana and Angada together with
Lakshmana along with their friends paid their respects with due ceremony to Rama, who looked
charming.
That Rama, the delight of Dasaratha, for his part, who had just killed his enemy and
thus who was steadfast in his vows and who was endowed with a great splendour, who stood surrounded
on the battle-field by his own people and the army shone like Indra the lord of celestials.In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish and
he bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is long
arms. 
Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to her
in a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing pampered his articulacy because his speech took
shelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent out
his heart in this way. 
"Flowers fascinate you very much, my dear, hence you veil yourself with the full
bloomed branches of Ashoka tree, but that alone is amplifying my anguish because you both have
presently became tormentors. 
"Maybe, both your thighs liken to the stalks of banana plants, thinking so, now you
have lapped them in grovy banana plants, but I can distinguish which is which, thus now I caught
sight of them, oh, lady, you are inapt at least to cover them from me. 
"Oh, lady, you are facetiously glorying in the boscage of fully bloomed Karnikaara
trees which is really wafting worry to me, rather than the fragrance of those flowers oh, glorious
lady, enough, enough is this facetiousness of yours. 
"I am aware of your humour, lady, and I know that you are jocose, but in a place
like hermitage unmerited is this sort of raillery, even if it is good-natured. Hence, you come
back, oh, wide-eyed one, your cottage is empty. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, very evidently demons have either gorged up Seetha, or perhaps
abducted her, because she is not returning to me who am whiny indeed for her. 
"Indeed these teary-eyed mobs of deer look as if to explain that nightwalkers have
gluttonised my lady. 
"Ha! My graceful lady, to where you have strayed now... Ha! Chastely and best
complexioned lady, now the ambition of my queen mother Kaikeyi will be fulfilled, as I breath my
last owing to your straying... 
"I have come to forests with Seetha and have to go back to Ayodhya without Seetha.
How, in all but name, can I step into an oblivion called my palace-chambers? 
"People will denounce me as a vigourless and pitiless person, and my ineptitude will
indeed be self-evident, for Seetha is led away from me by some tactical being... 
"When the king of Mithila Janaka asks after the wellbeing of all the three of us
after the completion of forest living, how do I have the face to stand him? 
"On seeing me without Seetha the king of Videha will be distraught by the perishing
of his daughter, and he defiantly goes under the preponderance of perplexity... 
"Instead, I prefer not to go to the city Ayodhya that is ruled by Bharata, because
it must be comforting to one and all under his rulership, but not to me as Seetha will not be with
me... else if, that end of my life occurs now and if I were to go to heaven, even that heaven will
be a void to me without her... I believe so... 
"Hence, Lakshmana, you go back to that auspicious city Ayodhya forsaking me in
forests, because I have no existence without Seetha, isn't it! 
"On tightly hugging Bharata you shall tell him these words as I have said, 'Rama
authorises you to reign the earth...' 
"Oh, efficacious Lakshmana, on revering my mothers Kaika, Sumitra, and Kausalya
justifiably you tell them my good bye, and you as the one who effectuates whatever is assigned to
you, you have to effortfully protect my mother Kausalya by doing whatever she says. 
"Oh, the subjugator of unfriendly, Lakshmana... you shall clearly inform in detail
about this perish of Seetha, also that of mine, to our mothers. 
Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, and
bewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha, is not found and missing from him. Even
Lakshmana became whey-faced, frantic-hearted, highly overwrought, by the fear of uncertainty
looming large on them. That prince Rama whom agony and anguish are distressing has become anxious in his mien, and he again 
drifted into a dire desperation while despairing his brother Lakshmana. 
Rama who is sunken in a chasmal sorrow spoke this sentence while wailing sorrowfully, suspiring severely 
and scorchingly, and which sentence is seemly to his sensitivity, to Lakshmana who is already under 
the sway of sorrow. 
"I am second to none among the blameworthy wrongdoers on this earth, thus I deem, and indeed woe followed 
by woe are getting at me in seriation to burst my heart and mind... 
"I might have definitely, habitually, and desirably committed damnable deeds in my previous births, 
and now the result of those impious deeds is very much ripened and has fallen on me, whereby I am entering 
misery after misery... 
"I am deprived of the kingdom, departed from my own people, mainly Seetha, my father departed and I 
am detached from my mother, and Lakshmana, when all these setbacks are very deeply thought over they 
are replenishing the haste of my agony... 
"All this sadness of mine has silenced physically and there is some peace on coming to these desolate 
forests, in association of Seetha, but with the dissociation of Seetha misery is again upshot, as with 
fire which flares up in a flash when fuel is added... 
"My noblewoman might be abducted by a demon, and on reaching the sky that lady who converses with a 
sweet voice might have wept a lot fearfully, and it is definite that she must have shouted a lot, untunefully... 

"Those two roundish bosoms of my ladylove which always deserved the application of pleasantly looking 
red-sandalwood's paste might definitely be unshiny, as they might be bedaubed with muddy blood when 
they are extricated from her body for devouring. 
"She has a sweet, softish, and very clear talkativeness on her lips. That visage with such lips is crowned 
with a hairdo with hair lumped together and plaited, such as her visage is, it must have become unshiny 
on her going into the repression of demon, as with an unshiny moon when repressed in the mouth of eclipsing 
planet Raahu, it is definite... 
"The contours of the neck of that strait-laced ladylove of mine are always worthy for necklaces and 
chain-wears. The bloodthirsty demons would have indeed mangled that neck in a secluded place and they 
might have drunk her blood, it is definite... 
"While I was away from her in this uninhibited forest demons would have forcibly hauled her up when 
they are abducting that lady with broad-bright eyes, and she would have discordantly shrieked out like 
a piteous she-dove, it is definite... 
"Sitting very close to me on this stone's surface, oh, Lakshmana, she that well-mannered Seetha with 
bright smiles was speaking to you verbosely with all smiles... 
"Among rivers this Godavari is the best and it is an all the time cherished river to my ladylove, and 
I think she would have gone thereunto. But, at anytime she did not go there, singly... 
"Or, that lotus-faced, lotus-petal eyed Seetha has gone straight to bring lotuses! Nay, that idea itself 
is incongruous, for she never goes to get lotuses, indeed without me... 
"But has she really gone to this stand of thicket which is with flowered trees and with birds of divers 
kind! Nay, that thought also is incongruent, because she as a timid one is much scared of solitude... 

"Oh, Sun, you are the knower of performed and unperformed deeds in the world, a wittnesser of good and 
bad deeds in the world, tell me, who am woefully writhing, to where my ladylove strolled, or is she 
stolen... 
"Oh, Air, whatsoever is there in the world, wheresoever it might be, or whensoever it might have happened, 
and whichsoever it might be, and whencesoever it might exist, that cannot possibly be unknown to you. 
Hence, tell me of the lady from noble heritage... is she stolen, or slain, or strayed her steps..." 
Thus Rama begged of the Eternals for locating Seetha. 
To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is insensately bewailing 
in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and timely suggestion. 
"Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let you be with spiritedness 
in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in their enterprises in this world, 
even though the enterprises are highly impracticable..." 
When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of Raghu's lineage, gave 
no heed to it, and since he castaway his fortitude he again encountered an inexplicable anguish. From here, until Rama meets Hanuma in next book Kishkindha, Rama's lamentation is continually portrayed. 
This may not be taken as a mere 'weeping' or 'bemoaning' of the principal character of the epic, but 
this has many poetics and romantics of epical poetry imbibed in it. An epic, basically, requires a hero 
to have his romantic attributes,naayaka lakshaNaaHand these 'wailings' 
will portray all of them. There are various, numerous and voluminous derivatives, meanings and commentaries, 
which cannot possibly be included in here, at this stage, except for passing references on them. Hence, 
this lengthy lamentation has lengthier romanticism.
On seeing the vacant threshold of the hermitage and empty cottage of straw, also at the leaf-mat-seats 
that are utterly shattered, and not finding Vaidehi even on watchfully eyeing everywhere Rama shrieked 
loudly, and then on clasping the winning shoulders of Lakshmana he said this to him. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, possibly where can be Vaidehi? Or, to which place she has gone from here? Or, Soumitri, 
who stole her away? Or, who has gorged up my ladylove? 
"Oh, Seetha, if you have concealed yourself under trees wishing to poke fun at me, enough is your fun 
and games, get in touch with me now, as I am highly anguished... 
"Oh, meek Seetha, with which meekly young deer you were playing, all these are now broody with tearfully 
fluttery looks, without you... 
"Really Lakshmana, I will not live long without Seetha, indeed I am enveloped in high anguish caused 
by the abduction of Seetha, and this alone will become a murderer, and on my going to other world when 
murdered by my own agony my father and that great king Dasharatha will definitely observe me in the 
other world... 
"When I go to other world after my death our father Dasharatha who is already staying there will deride 
me saying, 'when I have directed you for a fourteen year exile, and when you too have assuredly agreed 
and promised me for that term, how you have to my presence in this ultramundane world without completing 
that term of fourteen year exile, besides breaking your own word of honour... thus you have become a 
wilful disobedient, despicable and dishonest person, such as you are, fie on you...' 
"Anguish seared and bewildered me and I am woebegone with broken down buoyancy, and oh, beautiful lady, 
jilting such an woeful one as I am, where you are going now, as with prestige jilting a prevaricator? 
And if you shun me I will have to shun my life..." Thus Rama bewailed imaging her right in his front 
and running away. 
Though that legatee of Raghu is desperate for seeing Seetha, though he is highly anguished and agonised, 
though he bewailed this way, that Rama has not found Janaka's daughter, Seetha. 
To him who is unable to find Seetha, and who is sinking in sadness as with an elephant sinking in a 
chasmal mud, Lakshmana spoke to such a Rama in a positive manner desiring his wellbeing. 
"Oh, well-informed one, do not get into desperation, you make efforts along with me, and oh, brave one, 
this best mountain is beaming forth with many caves, she may be there somewhere. 
"Maithili is a fascinated saunterer in woodlands so she might have entered the forest, she is even infatuated 
with waters, so she might have gone to the fully bloomed lotus-lake, or to the river that is adorned 
by fishes and cane-breaks. 
"Or, wishing to know our reaction when she scares us with her prank, Maithili might have squirreled 
away into forest. Oh, honourable brother, let us endeavour quickly to search her. 
"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, if you consider that we shall search the forest in its entirety to locate where 
she that Janaka's daughter might be, let us quickly do so. But do not engulf your heart in sadness." 
Thus Lakshmana advised Rama. 
When Lakshmana good-heartedly spoke this way, Rama self-collectedly made a headway for the search of 
Seetha along with Soumitri. 
Those two sons of Dasharatha have started a thorough search for Seetha in forests, on mountains, also 
thus at rivers and lakes. 
On searching whole of mountainsides of that Mt. Chitrakuta, where their hermitage is there, even in 
its caves, crags, and mountain peaks they have not found Seetha. 
On exploring everywhere on that mountain Rama said to Lakshmana, "oh, Soumitri, here on this mountain 
I do not descry auspicious Vaidehi." 
While roving searchingly in Dandaka forest Lakshmana who is tormented by anguish said a sentence to 
his greatly resplendent brother Rama. 
"Oh, insightful brother, you will reacquire Janaka's daughter Maithili, as Vishnu once subjugated Emperor 
Bali and reacquired this earth." 
But when the valiant Lakshmana addressed him in that way, Raghava whose thinking is marred by poignance 
spoke these pathetic words. 
"This forest in its entirety, these lotus-lakes with their blossomed lotuses, and this mountain with 
its many caves and mountain-rapids, all are evidently searched. But, oh, sensible brother, I do not 
descry Vaidehi who is loftier than my lives." 
Lamenting in this way Rama languished owing to the abduction of Seetha and became a pitiable one, and 
while sadness besieging him he is perturbed for a moment. 
All the limbs of Rama are fluttered, his faculty has become functionless, his fervour is frozen, he 
is forlorn and flustered, and such as he is he sank down suspiring swelteringly and lengthily. 
Suspiring repeatedly he that lotus-eyed Rama shrieked repeatedly and loudly thus as, 'ha, Seetha...' 
with tears stifling his throat. 
Though Rama has many kinsfolk who hold him dear he is now left with a single one, namely Lakshmana, 
and that obedient brother Lakshmana who is already anguished for Rama's sadness, then adjoining his 
palms obediently started to pacify Rama with divers methods. 
But disavowing the word of advice that fell out from the cupped lips of Lakshmana, Rama stridently yelled 
again and again when his dear Seetha has become unseeable. While Rama is coming towards hermitage his lower eyelid frequently fluttered, his gait faltered, and 
he missed his footing. 
On closely watching those inauspicious forebodings Rama indeed uttered oftentimes reflexly thus as, 
'would she be safe, in fact!' 
He quickened himself and went with an ardency to see Seetha, and then on seeing an empty home his heart 
is distraught. 
Raghava looked like a flying-flutterer as his speed jostled his arms and gait flutteringly, and on closely 
probing there and there, and all-over the places of that cottage, then he saw the lustreless house of 
straw devoid of Seetha, alike a befogged wintry lotus-lake without lustre. 
The trees of that woodland are seemingly weeping, as their flowers are witheringly weakening and their 
birds are weepingly warbling, and the animals are whingeingly weeping, and that woodland is charmless 
and utterly shattered, since its georgic deities have completely abandoned it. Rather utterly bestrewn 
are the deerskins and sacred grass blades, rather utterly battered are the tender-grass-seats and other 
mats in the compound of cottage, and he who ardently wanted to see Seetha, such a Rama, on seeing such 
an emptied locale and cottage, wept over, over and again. 
"That bashful Seetha might be stolen by the grudging demons, or slain by the very same grisly demons, 
or savoured by some gruesome beasts, or else she strayed in this gauntly forest, and even she might 
have playfully shrouded herself in the grimly forest, or else she must be sheltering herself in this 
forest which will be gruelling to locate. 
"Or else, she might have again gone to pick the flowers or fruits, or again gone to lotus-lake, or gone 
to the river for water." Thinking thus, Rama started his search for Seetha. 
Though he searched effortfully for his dear Seetha he did not get her, and as his anguish is reddening 
his eyes the appearance of that glorious one seems to be that of a madman. 
Rama ran speedily from tree to shrub, from hill to hillock, from river to rivulet, and revolving around 
them he wailed for Seetha, as he is inundated in a sludgy ocean of woes. 
"Oh, Kadamba tree, seest thou someone a lady who is lover of Kadamba flowers, one with a lovable face 
and a love of mine, thou tellest me if thou knowest. 
"Oh, Bilva tree, if thou seest someone who is drest in yellowy-ochry silks, whose skin likens to the 
silkiness of thine leaflets, breasts to thine rotund and silky Bilva fruits, thou tellest me... 
"Otherwise, thou Arjuna tree, if thou knowest her who is a lover of thine Arjuna flowers and the ladylove 
of mine, thou telleth whether that slender-waisted daughter of Janaka liveth or otherwise... 
"As to how this Kakubha tree shineth laden with creepy-creepers, foliole-foliage and flowery-flowers, 
this tree knowest Maithili whose thighs can be likened to the smoothish trunk of this very Kakubha tree... 

"As to how this best tree among all trees heareth the chorus of honeybees that singest around it, thereby 
this Tilaka tree clearly knowest Maithili, a lover of Tilaka trees, as this shouldst have heard her. 

"Oh, Ashoka tree, an alleviator of agony, that is thine name lingually... but practically and readily 
name me after thine, by showing my ladylove, as my agony has marred my empathy... 
"Oh, Palm tree, if thou seest that lady breasted alike ripened-palm fruits of thine, and if thine mercy 
is mine, thou telleth of that shapely lady Seetha... 
"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thee knowest my ladylove with golden glitter, thou telleth 
me without hesitation...
"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thou knowest my ladylove whose complexion is smoothish 
like thine Rose-apples, thou telleth me unhesitatingly... 
"Aha! Karnikaara tree, now thou art in full bloom and blooming magnificently, if thou seest that lover 
of Karnikaara-flowers and an immaculate ladylove of mine, thou telleth me... 
"Or else, oh, deer, dost thou know what bechanced to that fawn-eyed Maithili, one with quick-looks like 
thee deer? Or else, hast she herded herself into the herd of she-deer of yours... 
"Oh, elephant, thou mightst beheld her whose thighs likens to your trunk at that problematic hour, thus 
methinks, and that Maithili is familiar to thee, and oh, best elephant, if thou beholdest her, thou 
tallest me... 
"Fear not, oh, tiger, hast thou seen Maithili, the moonfaced ladylove of mine, if thou hast seen speak 
in good faith... 
"Oh lotus-eyed lady, in fact I have seen you my dear, then why this running away and concealing yourself 
under trees, why do not you reply me... 
"Stay...stay... oh, best lady, don't you have mercy on me? You are not unacceptably tease-humoured! 
What for you ignore me? 
"Oh, beautifully complexioned lady, even if you are running away your yellowy silk-sari betokens you, 
stay, if you have goodwill for me... 
"Otherwise, she whom I have just seen me may not be Seetha, why because, it is unapt of her to avoid 
me who attained this wretched state, hence Seetha with cheery smiles is certainly murdered... 
"Obviously the raw-flesh gorgers must have gorged that youngish lady on diving all her limbs in my absence 
from my dear one... 
"Her face which is similar to a full-moon with pretty teeth, prettier lips, prettily nose and with prettyish 
earrings, might have obtained a blanched look when being devoured... 
"But that exquisite and beautiful neck of that lady which shines forth in the colour of Campaka flower, 
befitting for any neck ornament, indeed it might be glutted down while she is bewailing... 
"Her two arms which are delicate like tender leaves, ornamented with bangles and bicep-lets might have 
been definitely nibbled while they are wriggling with quivering fingers... 
"This is as though I have forsaken this youngish Seetha really as a feast for the demons in my absence, 
and though Seetha has many relatives she has become as worse as a lonesome woman who is completely forsaken 
by her caravan who is lonesomely ready for the feast of highwaymen, and demons have feasted on her. 

"Ha, Lakshmana... oh, dextrous one... have you seen my ladylove anywhere... ha, dear, where have you 
gone... oh, auspicious lady... ha, Seetha..." thus Rama lamented again and again in his search. 
On bewailing in this way and on overly rushing from wood to wood, somewhere Rama has become highly delusional 
by the forcefulness of delusion and spots forest stuff as Seetha, though none of them have any resemblance 
to Seetha, and somewhere else, marking creepers, plants or slender shrubs and suchlike delicacies as 
Seetha he has become really alluded by the powerfulness of allusion, and elsewhere, he is not discriminating 
paths or pathless routes for his trekking as an impassioned one in the search of his ladylove, and thus 
he is nitid like a madman. 
Rama is on the rove around woods, rivers, hills, mountain-rapids and thicketed forests, speedily and 
restlessly. 
On going round the vast of great forest in that way and on searching for Maithili, his hope became intangible, 
but again he undertook the search for his ladylove, over-strenuously. After completion of fourteen years of his exile and on the fifth day of the bright
half of the lunar month of Ashvayuja (roughly corresponding to the month of September), Rama, who
was disciplined even now, reaching the hermitage of the sage Bharadwaja, offered his salutation to
the sage.
Having offered his obeisance to Bharadwaja, who was rich in asceticism, Rama
enquired (of him): "Have you heard, O venerable one, of Ayodhya City having an abundance of food
and free from disease? Is that Bharata attentive in his rule? I hope my mothers are still
alive."
Hearing the words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage, quite rejoiced as he was,
smilingly replied to Rama (as follows):
"Bharata, with his mud-smeared limbs 9throwing the burden and blame ie. mud and with
matted locks, as also placing your wooden-sandals before him, is looking forward for your arrival.
All are safe at your home and in the city."
"O Rama, the victorious in battles! Formerly, on seeing you penetrating deeply into
the great forest on foot, with the sole intention of practicing virtue, clad in pieces of bark,
going away from sovereignty, deprived of all enjoyments, like an immortal fallen from heaven,
having renounced all your possession, with your spouse (Seetha) as the third (of your party besides
Lakshmana and yourself), resolved in carrying out the behest of your father and intent on
implementing the pledge given (by your father) to Kaikeyi and living on wild roots and fruits, pity
arose in me earlier."
"But now, a great delight occurred to me, on seeing you, having fulfilled your
purpose, that you have conquered your enemies and are accompanied by your host of friends and
relatives."
"That joy and sorrow experienced by you in abundance while residing in
Janasthana-forest in completely known to me, O Rama!"
"While you were busy in protecting all the ascetics who prayed you for safeguarding
the interests of Brahmanas, this irreproachable wife of yours was taken away by Ravana."
"O Rama, devoted to virtue! Even the appearance of Mareecha, the abduction of Seetha
by Ravana, the sight of Kabandha, your arrival at the Pampa lake, your alliance with Sugreeva, how
Vali was killed by you, the search-operation for Seetha, the exploit of Hanuma, the tracing of
Seetha, how the bridge, Nalasetu was constructed (over the sea), how the City of Lanka was set fire
by the rejoiced monkey-chiefs, how that Ravana who was the thorn in the side of gods and how was
arrogant of his might, was killed in battle, with his sons kinsfolk and his ministers as the gods
happened, how a boon was conferred by them on you- all this is known to me by virtue of my
asceticism. My disciples, who were accustomed to report to me the news, used to go to Ayodhya-City
from here."
"The friends, the riches and the grains are highly honoured in this world. Mother
and mother-land are far superior to even the heaven."
Bowing to the aforesaid statement of the sage with his head bent low, highly pleased
as he was and saying, "By all means" the glorious prince (Rama) asked of him the following
boon:
"O venerable sir! Let all the trees on the way, even as I fly to Ayodhya, bear fruit
even in the off-season and flow with honey. Let abundant fruits of various kinds, emitting the
fragrance of nectar, appear on them."
Once the consent of the sage was given in the words "be it so", the trees there grew
to be closely like the heavenly trees.
Then, for an extent of three Yojanas (twenty four miles) on all sides, in the
direction of their travel, the trees that no longer bore fruit, were laden with fruit and those
which had ceased to blossom looked charming with blossom. The withered trees were fully clothed
with foliage and further began to flow with honey.
Highly rejoiced who had conquered the heaven, those monkey-chiefs thereupon consumed
at will, thousands of many of those wonderful fruits.The prince Rama, having been invoked blessings by his mother, after having
salutation to Kausalya and remaining firmly in his virtuous path, set out journey to the forest.
Entering to the road filled with people, he made it shine with his splendour and stirred the hearts of the people because of his excellent qualities.
Sita, practising for the coronation ceremony, did not hear anything on that matter.
She was thinking of installation of Rama alone as prince Regent in her heart
As she knows what is to be done and is aware of rules relating to kings Sita herself being rejoiced in heart, performed the worship of the gods and was waiting for the prince.
Thereafter Rama, slightly turning his face down , entered his own house which is
well decorated and is filled with rejoicing people all around Sita sprang up from her seat and trembled by seeing her husband stricken with sorrow, his mind perturbed with anxiety.
By seeing her, Rama the virtuous man could not contain that grief existing in his
mind and hence got unveiled.
Seeing him pale-faced, perspired and without endurance, Sita (stricken with grief) spoke thus what is this now , my Lord!
Oh , Rama! It is indeed told by learned brahmanas that today's constellation Pushya (which is presided by sage bR^ihaspati) which is propitions, is suitable (for coronation). Why are you sadly disposed?
Your handsome face does not shine splendidly as it should when covered by an
umbrella white as water-froth and provided with a hundred ribs.
Nor your lotus -eyed face is not being fanned (as it should ) by superior chowries shining like a moon and a swan 
Nor the overjoyed and eloquent bards Sutas and Maagadhas (who sing portions of epic poems and ancient ballads ) are seen here , praising you with auspicious words .
Nor brahmanas who are well-versed in Vedas, have not placed , as per prescribed
Rites , honey and curds on your head after you had taken the head -bath
All ministers, chiefs of Associations, citizens and country-folk, duly decked with ornaments, are not inclined to go along with you.
Why the main carriage used for travelling and pleasure, tied with four horses decked with gold ornaments and with excellent speed does not go ahead of you ?
Oh, valiant prince! A glorious elephant which is worshipped for its good
characteristics, resembling a mountain crowned with a dark cloud is not seen ahead in your journey.
Oh, brave man pleasant with the sight! I do not see marching before you an elephant having been placed in front with an excellent seat embroidered in gold meant for you While coronation is getting ready now, the colour of your face is appearing strange. Even happiness is not being seen (in you). Why is it? 
Rama spoke thus to Sita, who is lamenting : Oh, Sita! My venerable father is sending me to a forest in exile.
Oh, Sita ! You are born in a great family. You know what is Right and practise
virtue . hear me in what sequence it happened to me Two great boons were given to my mother Kaikeyi long ago , by my father Dasaratha
who is true to a promise.
Now that the arrangements initiated by the king for my coronation are getting ready, Kaikeyi came out with that promise of boons, turning the situation to her own advantage by grounds of morality 
I have to dwell in Dandaka forest for fourteen years .Bharata is being appointed as prince by my father Before setting forth to the lonely forest, I came to see you. I should not be praised at any time in the presence of Bharata . Men endowed with power and fortune indeed do not tolerate praise of others . Therefore, my virtues should not be extolled by you in front of Bharata.
You need not be attended in a special manner at any time by him. You can stay
familiar to him, by behaving with him conformably.
The princely kingdom is given to him by the king permanently. Oh, Sita ! He is fit to be rendered gracious by you, more so the king Dasaratha
Keeping up the pledge of my father, today itself. Oh, Sita of magnanimous mind!
Remain firm.
Oh, Sita the good and faultless lady ! After I leave for the forest frequented by
the sages, you can become interested in religious vows and fastings.
You can rise up in dawn , perform worship of the deities as per precept and do
salutation to my father , king Dasaratha.
Keeping in front of righteousness alone, you have to respect the aged Kausalya, my mother who is getting emaciated by grief.
For me all my mothers are equal in my eyes in point if fondness, love and the way in which they have looked after me ( in my childhood). Hence the rest of mothers also deserve to be saluted always by you
You, in particular, should regard Bharata and Satrughna, as your brothers or
sons.
Bharata is indeed king and the master both for the kingdom and for our family .
Hence, you should not do what is displeasing to him at any time.
Kings being pleased by good character and served by exerting one's self become
happy. They get angry if it is to the contrary .Kings abandon even their own sons, if they are antagonistic and accept even other people if they are fitting Oh good lady ! You such dwell here, doing conformably to the will of Bharata the
king, remaining devoted to righteousness and with a vow of truth as you end.
Oh, my dear Sita ! I can go to the great forest. You can stay here only, without
doing harm to any one as it is .Listen to my wordsRama on killing that demon Maareecha, who is a guise changer at his wish and who moved about in the 
guise of a deer, instantly started to return on the trail by which he trailed after that deer-demon. 

While Rama is anxiously hurrying to see Maithili, then a brutish voiced jackal deafeningly howled at 
his behind. 
On hearing that threatening and hair-raising howl of jackal Rama is overly threatened just by the tone 
of fox in which it is foreboding, inasmuch as the forbidding intoning of Maareecha. 
"Huh! As to how this jackal has howled I deem that as inauspicious. As yet undevoured by demons would 
Vaidehi be safe? 
"On knowing the nature of my voice Maareecha in the semblance of a deer yelled out mimicking my voice. 
If Lakshmana listens that voice, recognising it as my voice he will instantly rush to my near. Else 
if Maithili listens, she will hasten him to go over here and Soumitri instantly rushes here leaving 
her off. 
"As could be seen from Maareecha's becoming a Golden Deer only to sidetrack and take me away from hermitage, 
his becoming a demon when hit with an arrow, and his shouting words indeed like, 'ha, Lakshmana, ha, 
Seetha, I am killed,' the demons are collectively intending to do away with Seetha. It is certain. 
"Whether there will be safety in forest for those two in my absence, or not, is my doubt. Owing to my 
devastating Janasthaana I have become a harboured grudge for demons, am not I! As such, foretokens are 
appearing now, severely and severally." Thus Rama's thoughts have sprinted. 
When that soulful Rama has heard the whistle of jackal while returning, he persistently thought in this 
way about his detour caused by demon in the disguise of a deer, thus he speedily advanced towards his 
hermitage. 
Raghava came to Janasthaana doubting overly, and the animals and birds of Janasthaana which look doleful 
have neared him whose heart has become doleful. 
Those doleful animals and birds moving in circumambulations from the left side to right of that noble-souled 
Rama they let off frightening shrieks, and then observing those highly forbidding foretokens Rama returned 
to his own hermitage hastily and hurriedly. 
Then Rama saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a lacklustre face, and then Lakshmana, who is melancholic 
and anguishing in his divergence from Seetha, met Rama not a long-way-off, where Rama is a similar partaker 
in melancholy and anguishing by way of his convergence upon ill-omens. 
On seeing Lakshmana who has arrived at this place leaving off Seetha in a forest that is desolate, more 
so an adorable forest for demons, Rama reproached him as his elder brother. 
Taking Lakshmana's left hand into his, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, alike a bewailer spoke this brusque 
speech that has a mellowly fruition in future. 
"You have done a deplorable deed in coming here forsaking Seetha. Now, oh, gentle Lakshmana, are we 
somewhat safe, or everything has already gone astray now itself, or what. 
"Oh, brave one, according to these many inauspicious forebodings that have manifested themselves to 
me, we might have lost Janaka's daughter Seetha, or the forest ranging demons might have devoured her, 
or else they might have kidnapped her, I am doubtless about it. 
"Oh, tigerly-man Lakshmana, I wonder whether we can at least make out the daughter of Janaka Seetha 
in her intactness and aliveness. 
"On observing these mobs of deer, this jackal, also even these birds which are voicing noisily facing 
the direction lit by the sun, oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, can we presume that there will be safety to 
that princes Seetha? 
"This very demon in his likeness to a deer led me on and led me off distantly as I was indeed following 
him, and by an intense effort somehow he was killed, and when dying he transfigured into a demon. 
"Now even my heart is woeful and I am woebegone, my left eye is also fluttering erratically, oh, Lakshmana, 
no doubt Seetha is not there in hermitage, maybe she is whisked away, or, wiped out, or, wandering around 
on a wrong way. 
Rama, the best proponent of probity, happily embraced Sugreeva with both of his arms and replied to him who was speaking 
in this way suppliantly adjoining palms at Rama. 
"There is no wonder, oh, enemy-flamer, if Indra gives rain, or if that thousand-rayed sun makes the sky undark, 
or if the moon makes night shiny with his moonshine, so also oh, gentle one, if a true friend of your kind gladdens 
his indigent friend, there is no wonder. 
"In this way, oh, nice Sugreeva, that helpful nature which is decorously prevailing in you, ushering you for organising 
the worthwhile, will not be a wonder but natural. I am aware that you have always been the exponent of affability. 

"With you as the helmsman, oh, friend, I will be triumphing over all the enemies, and you alone are worthy to 
proffer a helping hand to me as a good-hearted friend of mine. 
"That knavish demon Ravana deceitfully carried off Vaidehi for his extinction, as demon Anuhlaada carried 
off Sachi Devi, the daughter of Puloma. 
"As soon as possible I wish to eliminate that Ravana with sharp arrows, as has been done by the enemy slyer Indra 
when he eliminated the insolent father of Sachi Devi, namely Puloma." Thus Rama is about to tell other things 
to Sugreeva, but... 
In the meanwhile dust started to overcast the sky covering the intensely scorching radiation of the sun. 
Stained with that darkness the directions are confounded, and the entire earth together with its mountains, woods, 
and forests have wobbled. 
In a split-second, the entire ground is then enshrouded with incalculable fly-jumpers whose size is mountainous, 
fangs excruciating, and mighty abnormal, and each monkey commander is surrounded by hundreds of millions of legions 
of monkeys, who by their wish can change their guise, and these monkeys of amazing strength have come crashing 
war-whoops as clouds letting out thunders while they are on their way from their habitation like riversides, seashores, 
mountains and some other monkeys have come from forests as they are forest dwellers, and in the vast masses 
their complexion alone remained as an identity to their habitation, like the stripe of tender sun of some monkeys 
is marking them from the place of the rising sun, the moon-white body colour of some more telling that they are from the 
place of the nightly moon, and the colour of skin looking like lotus-fibrils of many more indicates that they are 
from fertile watery lands, and the snow-white complexion of yet some more indicates that the dwelling place of 
those monkeys are Mt. Meru. 
In the meantime, the arrival of a distinguished and valorous vanara named Shatabali hemmed in with ten thousand 
crores of vanara-s came into the view of Rama and others. 
Sushena, the father of Lady Tara, a valorous one with the sheen of the golden mountain then appeared with very many 
thousands of crores of vanara-s. 
Like that, the most efficient vanara-chief Taara, the father of Ruma and Sugreeva's father-in-law, turned up with 
another thousand crores of vanara-s following him. 
Honourable Kesari, the father of Hanuma, with his bodily gleam like that of the fibrils of lotuses and visage 
glittering in the gleam of the nascent sun, and who is an intellectual, graceful and prominent vanara among all the 
Canara-s then came into view associated with thousands and thousands of armies of vanara-s. 
Gavaaksha, the formidably adventurous sovereign of baboons is then seen encircled by a thousand crore vanara-s. 

Dhuumra, the enemy destroyer, marched to the fore of Rama and others surrounded by two thousand crores of bears 
which have frightful fastness. 
The highly valorous commander named Panasa has then arrived attended by a three crore legion of horrendous vanara-s 
who is beaming forth like gigantic mountains? 
Commander Niila has then come into view with his colossal and blackish mascara mound-like body encircled by ten 
crores of vanara-s that are selfsame to their leader. 
Then the great-mighty commander named Gavaya whose bodily sheen is like that of a golden mountain has come forth 
surrounded by five crores of vanara-s. 
Dariimukha, the mighty commander then came along with a thousand crore vanara-s and he stayed near Sugreeva 
drawing nigh of him. 
Both Mainda and Dvivida, the great-mighty sons of Ashvini-twin gods have then appeared, each with a thousand crore 
vanara-s. 
The mighty, braving and highly resplendent Gaja came forth to the near of Sugreeva encompassed by three crores 
of vanara-s. 
A great resplendent one who is renowned by his name Jambavanta has then come with a brigade of ten crore bears 
spreading around him and standing firm under the control of Sugreeva. 
A blaze-like mighty vanara named Rumana came swiftly surrounded by a hundred crore legion of vanara-s who are 
highly venturesome. 
Gandhamaadana has then arrived while ten thousand crores and a hundred thousand crores of monkeys are following 
him at his behind. 
Angada, the crown prince of Kishkindha, who matches his father Vali in valour has then turned up with a thousandpadmalegions and a hundredshankulegions of vanara-s. 

Tara, the vanara-commander, whose sparkle is as that of stars and whose valour is remarkable then appeared at 
a distance with five crore monkeys. 
Indrajaanu, the brave monkey commander who is the chief of eleven crores of monkeys has appeared then encompassed 
by selfsame vanara troopers. 
Rambha whose bodily glow is like that of tender-sun has then come forth fenced in a thousand plus a hundred ofaayuta-s of vanara legions. 
A braving and powerful legion commander of vanara-s named Durmukha has then appeared encompassed with two crores 
of vanara-s. 
Then Hanuma appeared with a thousand crore vanara-s encompassing him in shape like the summits of Mt. 
Kailash whose bravery is formidable. 
Highly vigorous Nala has also arrived while he is surrounded by a hundred crore one thousand and one hundred 
monkeys, the dwellers on trees. 
Dadhimukha, the salutary vanara-chief then arrived at the near that great-souled Sugreeva encircled by a ten 
crore vanara-s who are all blaring highly. 
Sharabha, Kumuda, Vahni, also even Ramha, these and many other vanara-s have come who by their wish are the guise-changers. 
And many of those other commanders who have presented themselves along with their troops, overspreading the earth 
inclusive of its mountains and forests, their count is unknown. 
All those fly-jumpers arrived by swinging, flying and thundering, and all of the monkeys on Earth have arrived 
thus, presented themselves and settled down around Sugreeva as if several clouds were cramming the sun. 
While arriving those monkeys made many a hue and cry of war, and those outstanding monkeys who were armed with 
a pair of their arms have informed the vanara king Sugreeva about their arrival by tilting up their heads 
as in roll-call or headcount. 
As befitting to them the other vanara leaders have come together to meet Sugreeva, and on their meeting with Sugreeva 
then they stayed behind with their palms adjoined. 
Then Sugreeva, the knower of rectitude, promptly informed about all of those paramount monkeys to Rama as to who 
is who, and staying with folded palms he addressed the forgathered monkey chiefs. 
"Oh, chiefs of vanara-s, on procedurally camping your forces everywhere on mountains, at riversides, and in forests 
according to their comfort, the knower of absolute force, Rama, expects to inspect them to infer the forcefulness 
of your forces. Bharata having returned (to Ayodhya), Rama who was dwelling in the woods, observed anxiety accompanied by perturbation among the sages.
He saw there those ascetics-who were formerly quite pleased in that hermitage at
Chitrakuta depending as they did on Rama- anxious.
Pointing out to Rama through the movements of their eyes and eye-brows manifesting their anxiety, they whispered among themselves, narrating some legends in secret.
Perceiving their distress, Rama was filled with apprehension about himself and with joined palms spoke the following words to a sage, the leader of that community of ascetics:
"O venerable sage! I fear that the conduct of my forefathers is not seen in me or
there is some change for the worse in me, due to which the ascetics feel agitated."
"Has my younger brother, the high-souled Lakshmana, through inadvertence, behaved
unworthy of him while the sages were seeing?"
"I hope that Seetha, who is serving you and who is keen in serving me, does not, I am afraid, behaved properly, according to the conduct suitable for women."
Then, that grown-up sage, who was elderly both by age and penance, appeared
trembling and spoke to Rama, who was ever compassionate to all beings, as follows:
"O, dear Rama! What is there for us the ascetics to fear above all from Seetha, who is natural in her disposition and is the follower of virtue?"
"It is on account of demons, who, through enmity to you, have begun to oppress the sages. Alarmed by it, they discuss with each other how they can best defend themselves."
"O, darling! Here, a demon called Khara, Ravana's younger brother- who is a boaster, victorious in battle, cruel and eater of human flesh, haughty and sinful-having uprooted all the ascetics who dwell in Janasthana, is unable to endure you also."
"My darling! From which time you came to dwell in this hermitage, from that time
inwards, the demons continue to ill-treat the ascetics."
"They appear in grotesque and harmful forms, filling them with terror, in diverse
forms and possessing ugly and unnatural demeanor."
"Flinging filthy and inauspicious objects on some of the ascetics, the wicked demons stand in front of them and kill some ascetics too."
"Having themselves in those hermitages unnoticed, those evil-minded demons delight themselves in destroying the ascetics there."
"At the time of pouring oblations into the sacred fire, they scatter the sacrificial vessels, sprinkle the fires with water and break the water-pots."
"Resolved to leave these retreats that have been invaded by evil spirits, the
ascetics today are urging me to go to another area."
"O, Rama! Before those wicked beings indeed show bodily injury to the ascetics, we are abandoning this hermitage."
"Not far from here, there is a colourful grove yielding many roots and fruits. I
will take shelter again in that previous hermitage itself, along with an assembly of sages."
"O, darling! Khara, the demon will behave unjustly with you in the same way. If your mind feels so inclined, come along with us from here."
"O, Rama! To you, who live with your wife, though you are competent and ever
watchful, there is a danger. Your stay here is conduced with misery now."
Rama the prince could not with his responsive words desist the said sage when he had spoken as aforesaid, eager as he was to leave the place.
Having greeted, bidding farewell and justifying his statement to Rama, that leader of the community departed, leaving the hermitage, along with a host of sages.
Accompanying them for a distance from that place, bidding farewell to that group of sages, offering his salutation to that ascetic, the leader of the community and taking leave of them, who were well-pleased and having received their counsel, Rama returned to his dwelling, which was sacred to reside.
That Rama, the lord, did not leave even for a moment that hermitage that had been
deserted by the sages. But some ascetics among them who had fixed their mind on Rama (who followed the conduct of the sages) constantly followed Rama.Seeing him firm minded in protecting the command of his father, Kausalya in a choked voice spoke these righteous words:
Rama who is born in me and Dasaratha, is a righteous person. He speaks lovingly to all beings. He has not faced grief at any time. How can such a person live in a forest, by gathering grains ?'
"While the dependants and the servants of Lord Rama eat pleasant foods all the
while, how can he eat roots and fruits himself in the forest ?"
"Hearing that Rama the beloved and virtuous is being thus sent to exile by the king , who will believe these words? Who will not develop fear ?"
Oh, Rama ! If you , the charming in the world are to go to exile , then it can be
certainly said that everything is ordered by a strong destiny'
"Oh, Son! Soon after your departure to a distant forest, a great and incomparable
fire of sorrow will generate in my whole body. The wind which flares it up is your not being seen here. My lamentation and grief are the fire-sticks. My wailing tears will be the offerings as an oblation to fire. The choking and anxiety will be a great smoke .The thought that when you would return, will generate smoke again. Such a fire of grief will make me emaciated completely and will burn like dry wood by fire in winter.'
"Oh, Son! A cow follows its calf wherever it goes. So also, I shall come with you
wherever you go."
"Kaikeyi already deceived the king .He will not be alive, when I leave for the
forest and you also leave him .It is certain."
"To a woman, abandonment of husband is entirely a cruel act. That bad act is not to be perceived even by mind."
"Till Dasaratha, my father and the great king is alive, you should serve him well. It is eternal justice."
After Rama spoke thus, Kausalya with auspicious appearance, was very much pleased
and spoke to Rama, who performs indefatigable actions, in consent.
That Rama, the best among upholders of righteousness, after hearing the words of his mother ,spoke again to her who was very much distressed.
"The words of father are to be followed by you and me. For all, he is the king, the nourished, a venerable man, the best among men, the lord and the ruler."
"After roaming in the great forest for fourteen years, I shall come back and very
gladly stand by your command."
After hearing the words of Rama, Kausalya who was affectionate to her son , was in great sorrow with her face filled with tears and spoke thus to her beloved son Rama .
"Oh, Rama! I can not reside in the middle of these step-wives. If you have made up your mind to go to forest as per your father's wish ,also take me, like taking a female deer of the forest ,to the woods "
"Rama spoke thus these words bemoaningly to her, who was weeping= "as long as a
woman is alive ,her husband is god and master to her".
"King Dasaratha, supreme commander has authority over you and me also now. when
king, the lord of the earth and the wise man is there , we are not indeed master-less.'
"Bharata also, who is a righteous person and who speaks lovingly to all beings will be obliging to you. He is indeed always devoted to righteousness.'
"While I take leave, take care of the king attentively so that he will not get
fatigued even a little with grief over his son."
"Act always soothingly for a well-being of the aged king, seeing that his terrible grief will not destroy him ."
Even if a woman is interested in religious vows and fastings in addition to being the best of the excellent ;if she does not obey her husband she will become ill-fated !''
Even if a woman does not offer salutation to celestials and does not worship the
gods, she will attain the highest heaven by service to her husband ."
She has to do service, truly devoted in love and welfare of her husband. This is
seen in the world from the beginning, was heard from ancient texts and mentioned as righteousness.'
Oh, Mother! You always worship gods by sacrificial fire and by flowers for my sake . Brahmanas also with right voes are to be worshipped .'
"Look forward for the time of my return in such a manner with restraint, being
temperate in food and being devoted in the service of your husband."
"After my return, your best desire will be fulfilled if our father the best among
protectors of righteousness ,is still alive till then."
Kausalya who was afflicted with grief over her son, was with eyes full of tears
after hearing Rama's utterances and spoke thus to Rama.
"Oh, Brave son! I am not able to avert your well-made resolution, in the matter of your going to forest. Time is inscrutable .It is certain."
"Oh, son! You go undisturbed. Let there be auspiciousness always to you .I shall
become refreshed, when you return again."
"You, the illustrious after accomplishing a purpose, having observed a vow and
having attained freedom from debt to your father, after having come again, I shall get great happiness".
"The path of the destiny, which extinguishes my words and impels you to go to the
forest ,is ever not imaginable on this earth"
"Oh, Rama the valiant !Go just now and come again safely, when you will rejoice me with your pleasing and tranquillising words ."
"How good it will be, if today itself is the day of your returning from the forest, wearing twisted hair and garment made of bark."
"The queen kausalya thus saw Rama who decided to go to forest .She spoke these words with most excellent mind to Rama having auspicious qualities, being desirous of averting evil by recitation of auspicious words."That army of valiant monkeys along with the king Sugriva looked charming like a full
moon night in autumn presided over by the moon and illuminated by bright stars.
The earth pressed under foot by that multitude of army which was energetic like a
sea, was trembled with fear by the rapid movement of that army.
Then the monkeys heard a great tumult arising in Lanka and noisy sounds of
kettledrums and tabours, which caused their hair to stand on end.
The leaders of monkeys were rejoiced by that sound. But by not tolerating that
sound, they emitted shouts, which surpassed that uproar.
Those demons too heard the roaring of the wildly delighted monkeys, which roar
sounded like thundering of clouds in the sky.
Seeing Lanka dressed with multi colored flags and buntings, Rama bethought himself
of Sita and his heart was filled with grief.
"Sita whose eyes resemble those of a young deer, was detained by Ravana there, as
Rohini star is overshadowed by the red bodied planet (mars)."
Seeing Lakshmana after a warm and deep sigh, the heroic Rama spoke the following
words, which were beneficial for him at that time :-
"O, Lakshmana! Look at this Lanka, which appears as though constructed on a hilltop
by Visvakarma with his imagination and so elevated scraping the sky."
The city of Lanka was constructed densely with many seven storied buildings and
appears like a sky the abode of Vishnu (the all pervaded), covered with white clouds."
"Lanka is made beautiful by the garden vying with chaitraratha (the garden of Kubera
the god of riches) with songs of birds of various species, with fruit bearing flowers and charms in
bloom.
"See how a gentle breeze sways the branches where the cuckoos abound where bees
swarm and where the birds are excited with joy."
Rama the son of Dasaratha spoke as aforesaid to Lakshmana. The army there was
divided into battalions according to the procedure found in scriptures.
He issued the following commands: --"Taking these troops of monkeys from the army,
let the valiant and the invincible Angada take up his position with Nila at the center of the
formation.
Let Rishabha along with the multitude of monkeys take up his position, having
recourse to the right side of the army."
"Let Gandhamadana, the strong and unconquerable, resembling an elephant in rut, take
his position superintending the left side of the monkey troops."
"I shall stand alert in the forefront of the army along with Lakshmana. Let
Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi the monkey - those three exceeding wise leaders of bears and
monkeys- protest the belly portion of the army."
"Let Sugriva the king of monkeys protect the rear guard of the army, resembling
Varuna (the god of water) who remains enveloped with splendor protects the western quarter of the
earth."
That army with innumerable divisions, being skillfully distributed led by the
foremost of monkeys, resembled heavens with their mass of clouds.
With a desire to crush the demons in battle, the monkeys, seizing peaks of mountains
and gigantic trees, reached Lanka.
All the heroic monkeys held the following resolve in their minds, "It is with peak
of mountains or with our bare fists even, we shall shatter this Lanka into pieces."
Then, Rama with great splendor spoke the following words to Sugriva, "Our forces are
properly marshaled. Let this Shuka be released."
Hearing the words of Rama, Sugriva the lord of monkeys released Shuka the messenger,
as per the order of Rama.
Shuka who was harassed by the monkeys and released then as per the words of Rama,
was trembling with great fear and reached Ravana.
Ravana, even while laughing, enquired Shuka with the following words: " why were
your wings tied up? You appear with your wings plucked up. Have you not fallen as a victim to their
various fickle minds?"
Asked as aforesaid by the king Ravana, Shuka agitated as he was with fear, gave him
the following excellent reply: "On the northern shore of the ocean, I conveyed your message in a
smooth tone, conciliating and without any ambiguity exactly as per your instructions."
"Just on seeing me, the enraged monkeys jumped on me and seized me. They soon
started beating and plucking me with their fists."
"O, Lord of demons! Those monkeys are not capable of being spoken to, or possible of
being questioned in this matter. Monkeys, by their very nature, are angry and ferocious."
"That Rama the killer of Viraadha, Kabandha and Khara came along with Sugriva to the
place of Sita."
"Having constructed a bridge across the sea and crossed the salty ocean and
expelling the demons, here stands Rama wielding a bow."
"Thousands of divisions of hordes of bears and monkeys resembling mountains and
clouds, cover the earth."
"There is no more possibility of an alliance between these two armies - the army of
demons and the army of monkeys- than between a God and a demon."
"Very soon they will come to our rampart. Immediately, do any one of these two acts-
either to restore Sita or to offer a combat to him."
Hearing the words of Shuka, Ravana with his eyes becoming blood red in anger, as if
he would consume him with his glance, said as follows:
"Even if I were frightened by all the worlds or even if I were to face a battle with
celestials or Gandharvas (celestial singers) or demons, I would not give back Sita."
"When will my arrows soon fall upon Rama, as large black bees excited with joy fall
upon a tree in bloom at spring time?"
"When shall I consume his body flowing with blood, by the blazing arrows released
from my bow, as flaming torches destroy an elephant?"
"Endowed with a huge army I shall eclipse the aforesaid army of Rama, as the
brilliance of all stars is obscured at the rising of the sun."
"My rashness is like that of the sea and my strength is like that of the wind. Rama
is not aware of it. That is why, he is desirous of meeting me in a combat."
"Rama has not seen my arrows resembling venomous serpents lying in my quiver. That
is why, he desires to fight with me."
Rama was not formerly aware of my prowess in battle. I shall cause to resound Vina
(a musical instrument) in the form of my bow, which is played on with the heads of my arrows, the
bow string producing a tumultuous sound, the huge cries of the wounded its terrible accompaniment,
the darts sounding its innumerable notes, when I enter a vast stage in the form of my enemy ranks
in that battle."
"Neither by the thousand eyed Indra the god of celestials nor by Varuna the God of
waters in person in a combat, nor by Yama the god of death with the fire of his arrows, nor by
Kubera the lord of riches in person, can I be able to be attacked in a great battle."Rama on the other hand, pacifying Lakshmana (son of Sumitra), who was very much
agitated and infatuated with anger, spoke the following words:
"While Bharata, wieldin a bow and highly wise-man himself is coming here, what is
the use of a bow or sword with a shield?"
"O, Lakshmana! Having promised to make our father's wish a reality. What shall I do with the kingdom by acquiring an ill-fame in killing Bharata who came here to see me?"
"I should not enjoy the spoils obtained by slaying a relative or friend, like the
partaking of a poisoned food."
"O, Lakshmana! It is for your sake I desire virtue, legitimately acquired wealth and pleasure or even the earth itself. I promise this to you."
"O, Lakshmana! I desire the throne only for the protection and happiness of my
brothers. I touch my weapon and swear this fact."
"This earth, bounded by the sea is not hard to obtain for me, O the excellent man! I do not indeed wish even the position of Indra by unrighteousness."
"If there be happiness that I could enjoy without Bharata or you or without
Shatrughna, may it be without Shatrughna, may it be burnt to ashes by fire, O the
honour-giver!"
"I think Bharata was back to Ayodhya, with full of affection for his brothers. He is dearer to me than my life- he who is mindful of the duties of his race. Hearing of my exile and that I was wearing matted locks and the antelope skin, accompanied by Seetha and you, O most valiant of warriors, in his devotion towards me and due to the distress that troubles his mind, Bharata has come to see me. He has not come with any other motive."
"Getting angry with Kaikeyi his mother and speaking unkind and harsh words to her, the glorious Bharata after getting permission from our further, came here to bestow kingdom to me."
"This is the proper time for Bharata to come here and see us. He does not behave or even think unkindly towards us."
"Has Bharata at any time done any harm to you previously? What so the reason for you to be so apprehensive of Bharata now?"
"Indeed, Bharata must not hear harsh or disagreeable word from your lips. If an
affront is offered to him, it is offered to me!"
"O, Lakshmana! How should a son strike his father, even in a distress or a brother strike a brother who is as dear to him as his life?"
"If you are uttering these words for the sake of the kingdom, I shall tell Bharata to give the kingdom to you, when I see him."
"O, Lakshmana! When Bharata receives this command from me, "Cede the empire to him", he will answer, So, be it."
At these words spoken by his honourable brother, to whom he was devoted, abashed,
shrank into himself.
Listening to these words ashamed, answered: "I think that our father Dasaratha came here to see you himself."
Observing the emberassed , Rama said, "I think the mighty armed Dasaratha came here to see us."
"Or rather, to my mind, as he knows that we have been accustomed to comfort,
reflecting that we are dwelling in the forest, he wishes to take us home."
"The glorious Dasaratha, my father possibly will take back Seetha from the forest, she who has ever lived in the heart of prosperity."
"O, warrior! See those two excellent horses of noble breed, shining attractively and vying with the wind in swiftness."
"Here is that colossal elephant who is moving at the head of the army called
Shatrunjaya, the aged companion of our sagacious father."
"O, the mighty armed! But I do not see that white heavenly canopy of our father,
well known insignia in the world. An apprehension on this point is created in my mind."
"O, Lakshmana! You get down from the top of the tree. Act on my word." Thus spoke
the virtuous Rama to that Lakshmana.
Descending from the top of that Sala tree, Lakshmana the victorious in battle, with joined palms, stood by the side of Rama.
Commanded by Bharata that no trampling of army should be made in the hermitage of
Rama, the army was encamped round the mountain.
That royal army of Ikshvaku race, crowded with elephants horses and chariots was
encamped around the edge of the mountain occupying an area of one Yojana and a half.
Brought by the virtuous Bharata, who laid aside his arrogance, placing the
righteousness in forefront in order to propitiate Rama, that army showed itself to be disciplined in the vicinity of Chitrakuta.Then Rama taking his position at the banks of Tamasa river and looking at Sita,
spoke to Lakshmana as follows :
"Oh, Lakshmana! We have been sent to the forest. Today is the first night of our
residence in the forest .You ought not feel anxious. May all be well with you!"
"Look here: As the animals and birds are returning to their respective abodes
seeking for shelter, the desolate woods seem to be crying from all sides"
"Now, the city of Ayodhya the capital of my father with its men and women will
lament about us that have departed (to the forest). There is no doubt"
"Oh, tiger among men! The citizens (of Ayodhya) are indeed having affection to the king no less than to you and myself, as also to Bharata and Satrughna, for many of our virtues."
"I feel repented for my father and my illustrious mother. I fear whether they will become even blind, by weeping incessantly."
"Bharata, the virtuous man, can indeed console my father and mother by his kind
words."
"Oh,Lakshmana! Thinking of Bharata's kindness again and again, I do not grieve for our father and mother"
"Oh, Lakshmana, tiger among men! You have done well by accompanying me, as
otherwise, a help would have to be sought for by me for protecting Seetha"
" Oh, Lakshmana! I shall live on water alone tonight. Though there are various kinds of wild fruits and roots, this is indeed a liking for me"
Thus telling Lakshmana, Rama spoke also to Sumantra as follows: "Oh, gentle man!
Attend to the horses carefully."
The sun having completely set, Sumantra tied up the horses, supplied them with
abundant grass and immediately stood nearest (to Rama).
Having worshipped the beautiful evening twilight and having seen the night come
nearer, Sumantra along with Lakshmana made the bed for Rama.
Seeing that bed made of leaves of a tree on the bank of Tamasa river with the help of Lakshmana, Rama along with his wife laid down on it.
Seeing that brother sleeping along with his wife, Lakshmana narrated Rama's various virtues to Sumantra.
WhileLakshmana was thus recounting Rama's excellences to Sumantra, keeping awake
that whole night at the bank of Tamasa river, the sun rose.
At a good distance from Tamasa river, whose banks were crowded with herds of cows, Rama passed that night there with the citizens.
Getting up from the bed and seeing those citizens, Rama with an extraordinary
splendor, spoke to his brother, Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks: "Observe, Oh Lakshmana, the citizens full of longing for us, unmindful even of their homes, sleeping together at the roots of trees, Oh, the son of Sumitra!"
"From the way in which these citizens are making coercion to take us back (to
Ayodhya), it seems they will even lay down their lives, but in no case would give up their resolve"
"Till which time the citizens are asleep, within that time, let us quickly mount the chariot and take a route which has no fear from any quarter"
"From this the citizens of Ayodhya (the ancient capital of Ikshvaku), who are
longing for me, may not sleep as of now, at the roots of trees again and again"
"The residents of city should indeed be made free of their suffering brought about by (citizens) themselves, by the sons of their rulers. The citizens should on no account be burdened with hardship caused by (princes) them selves as is our case."
Lakshmana replied as follows to Rama, who is standing firm like righteousness
personified: "Oh, wise brother! What you say is agreeable to me. (Pray) ascend the chariot quickly"
Then, the glorious Rama spoke to the charioteer as follows: "Oh, capable man! Keep the chariot ready. I shall proceed to the forest. Let us go quickly from here."
Then, Sumantra quickly fastened the chariot to its excellent horses and thereafter submitted with joined palms to Rama (as follows):
"Oh, mighty armed prince! Your chariot is kept ready. You ascend it along with Sita and with Lakshmana, Oh jewel among car-warriors! May prosperity attend you"
Rama mounted the chariot with all necessaries (like bow, armor, quiver, spade,
basket, and so on) and crossed the swift flowing Tamasa river, thickly set with whirl- pools.
Having duly crossed the stream, the glorious Rama the mighty armed reached a great road free from obstacles and safe even for those who are apprehensive of danger.
In order to elude the citizens, Rama spoke to Sumantra as follows: "Oh, charioteer! You mount the chariot and go northward. Proceed for a while quickly and bring back the chariot again. Remaining careful, do it in such a way that the citizens may not be able to locate me"
Hearing Rama's advice, the charioteer made a round of the chariot as he was
suggested and on returning, reported to Rama about the arrival of the chariot.
Then, Rama and Lakshmana(the promoters of the race of Raghu) along with Sita
ascended the chariot yoked together. The charioteer urged the horses along the route by which they can reach a grove suited to the practice of austerities.
However, Sumantra placed that chariot by facing it to the north, for he saw omens
auspicious for journey (in that quarter). Rama (son of Dasaratha) the mighty car-warrior, along with the charioteer mounted the chariot and proceeded to the forest.Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha gave away abundant riches to brahmanas and went along with Seetha to see their father.
Those weapons held by Rama and Lakshmana were tied on with garlands by Seetha. The weapons thus decorated were shining brilliantly and were fearful to look at.
Then, wealthy people ascended lofty palatial mansions, large buildings and tops of palaces of seven stories high and saw them spiritlessly,
The streets were indeed difficult to walk, congested as they were, with many men.
For that reason, being in distress, they were seeing Rama by ascending lofty palatial buildings.
Then, by seeing Rama as a pedestrian without an umbrella, the people with their
hearts struck by grief were uttering words of many sorts.
The same Sri Rama who was followed by a strong four wings of army(comprising
elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry), is walking lonely with Seetha followed by Lakshmana.
Rama knew the taste of sovereignty. He can grant desires to the desirous. Even then, because of his respect for virtue, he is careful not to believe his father's words.
Even people walking on road are able to see Seetha, who could not earlier be seen
even by beings going through the air.
Rain, heat and cold will quickly wane to pallor Seetha, who was fond of applying
suitable cosmetics and red sandal to the body.
How banishment can be affected on a son, even devoid of virtues? Why to tell further of whom, this world is conquered merely by his mode of conduct?
Harmlessness, compassion, learning, good nature, self-control and tranquillity -
these six virtues adorn Rama, the best of men.
Therefore, people are extremely painful for the injury done to him, as aquatic
beings in summer are afflicted because of depletion of water.
The entire world feels afflicted by the hardship inflicted on this protector of the world, as a tree which acquired flowers and fruits is damaged by injury caused to its root.
This Rama, the essence of virtue possessing great lustre, is indeed the root of the tree of humanity. Other men are his flowers, fruits and branches.
We as such along with our wives and relatives atone will follow Rama in the same way as Lakshmana is going with the departing Rama.
Abandoning gardens fields and houses, we shall follow Rama the righteous man, and
share his joys and sorrows.
Let Kaikeyi obtain the houses deserted by us, their treasures unearthed, their
court-yards in ruined state, their wealth and food grains removed, their best parts robbed off from all sides, covered by dust, deserted by the deities(presiding them), overrun by mice, coming out of their holes and turning round here and there, without water and smoke, upswept, the rises of offering oblations to all creatures as well as the sacred fire, worship of gods, the chanting of sacred texts and muttering of prayers having altogether ceased, as though dilapidated by adverse times and scattered with broken vessels.
As Rama is going away to the forest, let that forest become a city and let this city being deserted by us become a forest.
Scared by fear of us, let all the snakes abandon their holes, the dears and birds
the mountain peaks, the elephants and the lions the forest itself. let them leave the region going to be inhabited by us and reach the city of Ayodhya.
Let Kaikeyi with her son along with her relatives indeed inhabit the region where
ferocious animals and vultures live with grass, meat and fruits. Let us all (on the other hand) live happily in the forest along with Rama.
Rama heard various kinds of remarks thus made by many people. Hearing them also, his mind was not disturbed.
That Rama the virtuous man, by walking with strides of an elephant in rut,
approached his father's palace, which from a distance glowed like a peak of the Kailasa mountain.
After entering the royal palace, which had in it disciplined and valiant attendants, saw Sumantra standing dejected not far from the palace.
The, Rama even on seeing the people disturbed, appeared unmoved and smiling,
intending to fulfill his father's behest and went to see his father.
Seeing Sumantra appearing disturbed before that, Rama the son of Dasaratha( a scion of Ikshhvaaku) whose mind is mighty and who is setting out to the forest, waited awhile to have his presence announced to his father.
That Rama, who had passion towards piety, having made up his mind positively to
enter the exile as per his father's command, spoke thus, seeing Sumantra, "Inform my arrival to the king."Vibhishana, wishing victory to Rama, (the destroyer of adversaries) who having
reposed during the previous night and had risen fresh, spoke to him with joined palms, the
following words:
"These women with lotus-like eyes, who are skilled in the art of decoration, came
with bathing accessories like garments, ornaments, sandal-pastes and beautiful garlands of various
kinds. They will assist you in bathing O Rama!"
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Rama replied as follows: "You invite the monkeys
headed by Sugreeva for the bath."
"That Bharata, the virtuous man, who was accustomed to comfort, a delicate youth,
the great-armed and the one consistent with the truth is suffering on my account."
In the absence of Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, who is practicing virtue, ritual
bathing, garments and jewels are not to my liking."
"See how we may return to that City of Ayodhya soon. It is indeed very difficult to
travel over this path to reach Ayodhya City, so soon."
Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana replied : "O prince! I will get you t that
City in a day."
"O Rama of unequalled prowess! The aerial car shining like the sun, which moves as
one pleases, wonderful and excellent, named Pushpaka of Kubera my brother was robbed by the mighty
Ravana after conquering Kubera in battle. May prosperity attend you! It is retained there for your
sake."
"The yonder aerial car, looking like a cloud, stands here and by which transport,
you can reach Ayodhya without any trouble."
"O sagacious prince! If I deserve to be treated with kindness by you, if you think
of any virtue in me and if you think of any virtue in me and if you have any affection in me, stay
here for some more time."
"O Rama! When you have been offered with reference all the entertainments, you along
with Lakshmana, your brother and Seetha your consort, shall then depart."
"O Rama! In the meantime, accept you, with your entire army and assemblage of
friends, my hospitality which has been fixed and arranged by me, full of affection as I am."
"O Rama! I entreat you with affection, respect and friendship I am your servant. I
am not in any way commanding you to do so."
Hearing those words, Rama replied to Vibhishana as follows, while all the demons and
the monkeys present there, listened:
"O destroyer of enemies! O hero! I stand honoured by you by your valued counsel,
your efforts put forth with your whole soul and more so by your friendship.
"O king of demons! It is not that I am not carrying out your words. But, my heart is
hastening to see that Bharata, my brother."
"My heart is hastening to see that Bharata, who came all the way to Mount Chitrakuta
to take me back to Ayodhya, yet whose appeal was not executed by me, even though he requested me
with his head bent low and Kausalya my mother as also Sumitra and the illustrious Kaikeyi (my
step-mothers) as also Guha my friend, as well as the citizens of Ayodhya and the inhabitants of the
country-side."
"O gentle Vibhishana! Allow me to go. I am honoured. O friend! You need not be
disappointed, I entreat you."
"O the king of demons! Fetch the aerial car immediately. How is it advisable for my
continued stay here, now that my task has been accomplished?"
Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the king of demons then hastily invoked the
presence of that aerial car shining like the sun, with colourful parts made of gold, with the
platform made of cat's-eye gems, which was full of attics, shone like silver on all sides,
decorated well with white flags and flag-staff, decked with gold and golden lotuses, graced with
golden mansions, hung all over with networks of tiny bells, giving forth a melodious sound on all
sides, resembling a summit of Mount Meru, built by Vishvakarma, which was graced with stately
palaces decked with pearls and silver, provided with pavements inlaid with crystal, furnished with
excellent seats of cat's eye gems of great value and upholstered with highly valuable
coverings.
Informing Rama that the said aerial car which could not be assailed and was as swift
as though- had arrived, Vibhishana stood there.
The generous minded Rama along with Lakshmana felt amazed to see the aforesaid
aerial car, Pushpaka, which resembled a mountain and which could travel everywhere at will, arrived
on that occasion.After hearing Jabali's words, Rama the best among virtuous and upright men spoke
with a great devotion and with an undisturbed mind of his own (as follows);
"That which, in your desire to please me, you have counselled, is impossible though it appears to be possible. It is like a forbidden food, appearing to be an agreeable one."
"He who is unruly, fully invested with ill-conduct, having a bad reputation and
seeing differences in everything, does not gain respect from honest men."
"One's conduct itself explains whether one belongs to a good family or a bad family, valiant or arrogant and chaste or unchaste."
"What sensible man, able to discern what is just and what is unjust, in this world, would respect me, if I am ignoble resembling as noble, bereft of honesty, impure, having no good qualities but appearing like the one having good qualities, ill-behaved but appearing as well-behaved abandoning righteousness and getting hold of unrighteousness in the guise of piety, creating confusion in the world and disregarding rules of conduct."
"If I behave in this manner faithlessly, to whom can I advise a prescribed conduct? How would I attain heaven?"
"This entire world would follow its own whims, for, whatever the conduct of the
kings may be, such will be the coduct of their subjects."
"The eternal royal governance is indeed an assemble of truth and not cruel. Hence, the kingship has the Truth as its essence. The world is established in Truth."
"Even sages and divine being have respected truthfulness alone. The one who speaks truth obtains the highest position in this world."
"People fear of a person, who speaks untruth, as one fears a snake. Truth is the
highest virtue and is stated to be the origin of heaven."
"Truth is god and all virtues follow truth. All are rooted in truth there is nothing higher than truth."
"Gift sacrifice, oblation, austerities performed and the scriptural texts have the foundation in Truth. Hence, one should thoroughly surrender to truth.
"One rules over the world. One develops a race. One sinks into hell . One rises high to heaven (according to one's degree of truthfulness practiced)."
"I am true to my promise. Why should I not fulfilll the command of my father, who
was a devotee of truth?"
"Neither covetousness nor forgetfulness nor pride would cause me to destroy the bond of morality. I shall honour the vow made to my father."
"Neither gods nor the manes will accept the offerings of those who are wanting in
truth, unsteady and unstable in their minds. This is what is taught to us."
"I perceive this virtue i the form of truthfulness as a universal permeation of
spirit. That is why, this burden, observed as a vow, has been honoured by good men."
"I renounce the so-called duty of a warrior, it is injustice under the name of
justice, it is practised by petty cruel and covetous men of evil deeds."
"Sin is committed by the body after it has been conceived by the mind and falsehood is spoken with the tongue. Thus, the degrading act is of three types (with body, mind and tongue)"
"The earth, fame, prosperity and fortune indeed woo a man of truth. They constantly oblige the truth: truth should therefore be strictly observed!"
"The logical words, you have made it out to be good, saying 'Do this good thing' as uttered to me, are really unworthy."
"Having promised before my father about my exile to the forest, how can I fulfil
Bharata's words now, abandoning the father's words?"
"A firm promise has been made by me in the presence of my father, when Queen Kaikeyi too became rejoiced."
"I will proceed with life-journey in this manner, by accepting this dwelling in the forest, by remaining pure in body and mind, having controlled my diet, by feasting the Gods and Ancestors with pure roots, flowers and fruits, with all my five senses fully sated, without any deceit, fully devout and discriminative of what ought to be done and what ought not to be done."
"Having reached this terrestrial globe (the realm of action), only a virtuous act is to be undertaken. The god of fire, the wind-god and the moon-god reap the fruits of their acts."
"Having performed ahundred sacrifices, Indra the Lord of celestials went to heaven. Having practised severe austerities, the great sages went to heaven."
Hearing that argument of atheism inuntiated by Jabali, Rama the prince with a
terrible energy, without tolerating his words, spoke in reproach to him (as follows):
"The virtuous say that truth, piety, valour, compassion for all beings, polite
speech and worship of Brahmanas, gods and unexpected guests are the paths to heaven."
"Therefore the learned, well-instructed in what is to be their greatest advantage; follow their purpose resolutely and fulfill their duty in its entirety properly and attentively, seeking to attain the highest realms."
"I accuse the act done by my father in taking you into his service, you with your
misleading intelligence, a firm atheist fallen from the true path."
"It is an exact state of the case that a mere *intellection deserves to be punished as it were a thief and know an atheist to be on par with a mere intellectual. Therefore he is the most suspectable and should be punished in the interest of the poeple. In no case should a wise man consort with an atheist."
"Men that lived before you have performed many auspicious acts, abandoning all hopes of reward in this world as well as the next. Therefore, Brahmanas offer oblations in the sacred fire and practise noble deeds."
"The sages who are devoted to righteousness, associating with men of virtue, endowed with spiritual splendour, practising abundant charity, harm-less and washed free of all taint, are honoured into the world."
"To the high-souled Rama, who never had self-pity and speaking indignantly as
aforesaid, Jabali (that brahmana) replied in a fitting manner in words that were beneficial and truthful, which showed his belief in authority of Vedas, the other world and so on."
"I am not speaking the words of non- believers. I am not an atheist, nor is it a
fact that nothing exists whatsoever. Perceiving the time, I have become a believer. When the time comes, I will become again just a non-believer."
"O, Rama! That and this time too came gradually. The words of a non-believer were
spoken by me for your sake, to pacify you and to persuade you to return to Ayodhya."The content of this chapter is to amplify what that has been said in the previous chapter. This dialogue 
between Rama and Lakshmana may be deemed to have happened before their approaching hermitage, as in 
the last few verses of last chapter, and on their pathway to their hermitage.
Rama the descendent of Raghu, again asked Soumitri who strayed from the hermitage and whom his own anguish 
is distressing now, in the middle of path towards their hermitage. 
Rama spoke to such Lakshmana, "when I left her in the forest, I left only on confiding in you. For what 
reason you came to me on abandoning Maithili? 
"What my heart had been doubting, rather a perilous evil, oh, Lakshmana, that has become a fact on seeing 
only you, coming to me leaving off Maithili. 
"Seeing your coming without Seetha on pathway at a distance my left eye and left shoulder have pulsated, 
and oh, Lakshmana, my heart too has fluttered." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. 
When Sumitra's son Lakshmana, whose traits are blamelessly auspicious is addressed thus, anguish cast 
a double spell on him, one for the tongue-lashing of Seetha while the other for the reproach from Rama, 
and he replied Rama who is anguished in his own way. 
"I have not come here leaving her off either independently or intentionally, I came here, to your proximity, 
virtually driven by her hurtful words." Thus Lakshmana is relying Rama. 
"Maithili gave an ear to that message which is loudly shouted as if by your honour saying, 'ha, Seetha... 
ha, Lakshmana... save me immediately...' 
"On hearing that grievous voice of yours and owing to her love for you she shuddered with fear and wept 
out to me 'hurry up...get going...' 
"When she frequently and insistingly compelled me to go, I have replied Maithili in this sentence which 
is expressive of my confidence in you. 
" 'I do no think that there is a demon who can cause panic to Rama. All this is feigning. Someone might 
have typified his voice in this way, please control yourself. 
" 'How can my esteemed brother who can safeguard even gods, oh, Seetha, will exclaim in saying, 'save 
me,' which is a highly disparaging and basely manner to call for the help of a lady to safeguard him 
in such circumstances. 
" 'But, somehow, for some reason, someone mimicking my brother's voice discordantly shouted words saying, 
'Lakshmana save me.' 
" 'Oh, auspicious lady, it is unbefitting for you to panic, like lowly womenfolk who will be frivolously 
panicking for flimsy reasons, for the words like 'save me,' shouted by some demon, who may conceivably 
be Maareecha. 
" 'Enough is your slipping into consternation and you be undismayed. There is none in all the three 
worlds who took birth, or going to take birth, to defeat Raghava in any given battle of any terrible 
nature. Raghava is undefeatable even if all gods come battling along with Indra in their van.' This 
is what I said to Vaidehi" Thus Lakshmana is informing Rama. 
"Though I said thus, while her volition is overly besotted for you, Vaidehi said this tartly word to 
me outpouring tears. 
" 'In my respect you have harboured only an impure and nastily perspective to achieve me on the utter 
ruination of your brother, but I am unachievable to you. 
" 'As to why you are refraining to rush towards Rama even though he is inordinately yelling, it hints 
that Bharata made some arrangements with you, and that is the reason why you have closely followed Rama 
in exile. 
" 'You are an adversary of Rama comporting yourself in disguise, following him because of me, and searching 
for a leeway from Rama. Thereby now you are not rushing to Rama. 
"When Vaidehi spoke to me thus I hurriedly came out of hermitage to you with anger reddening my eyes 
and trembling my lips. 
Rama who is deluded by angst said to Soumitri who is speaking thus, that "your arrival without her is 
an improper deed, oh, gentle one. 
"You know that I am capable enough to foil the demons, even then you have come out by the angry words 
of Maithili? 
"On hearing bitter words of an angry lady you have came away on leaving her off, such as you are, I 
am not at all happy with you. 
"That which action of yours is there in non-compliance of my directive to stand guard to Seetha, either 
compelled by Seetha, or coming under your own ire, it shows your dereliction in everyway. 
"By whom I am detoured from hermitage in the form of a deer he is indeed a demon, and he fell flat when 
my arrow hit him down. 
"When I effortlessly shot an arrow setting on bowstring and stretching the bow to full length, he hit 
by that arrow left deer's body to become a piteously bewailing demon wearing bracelets and the like 
ornaments. 
"Then hit down by arrow thus, he with an anguished voice that is clearly audible at a very remotely 
place and that which is mimicking my voice, uttered those highly gruesome words, whereby you have come 
here forsaking Maithili." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana on their way to their hermitage. Hearing the well-founded and highly reasonable words of Sugreeva, Rama concurred
with him and spoke then to Hanuma as follows:
"I am competent of crossing this ocean by all means, either by way of austerity or
by forming a bridge or by drying up the ocean."
"Tell me how many citadels in Lanka are difficult of access, Oh, Hanuma! I desire to
know all that, as though viewed with an eye."
"You had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the size of the army, the
fortification-details of the gates and citadels, the way in which Lanka was guarded and the various
mansions of ogres. Describe everything in accordance with facts, for you are skilled in all
ways."
Hearing the words of Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who was excellent in the art
of expression, forthwith spoke once more to Rama as follows:
"Listen to me! I shall tell you everything-how the city of Lanka has been defended
by the various methods of fortification and how it has been guarded by the troops."
"I shall tell you the details of how the ogres are attached to their king, the
excellent prosperity of Lanka generated by the glory of Ravana, the awfulness of the ocean, the
division of the body of his forces and of animals like horses and elephants carrying his forcesother than the infantry." Saying so, Hanuma the foremost among monkeys, who knew the truth narrated
as follows.
"The great Lanka was rejoiced and gayful, full of elephants in rut, abounding in
chariots and inhabited by gangs of ogres."
"Four fairly big and extensive gates are fitted with strong doors along with huge
beams for locking those gates."
"Strong and mighty ballista capable of hurling darts and stones have been attached
to them. The enemy troops which arrive there are warded off by those catapults at the very
gates."
"Dangerous and sharp edged Sataghnis made of iron, forged by hordes of ogres, have
been kept in readiness in hundreds at the gates.
"A great rampart made of gold, which is difficult to assail with violence and is
inlaid at intervals with gems, corals, cat's eyes and pearls, encircle that Lanka."
"Most awe-inspiring and fathomless moats (deep trenches) of great splendor, filled
with cold water, infested with alligators and inhabited by fishes are there all round the
city."
"Anterior to the gateways, there are four very extensive draw-bridges, equipped with
numerous engines and furnished with many rows of buildings (built on the rampart and meant for
those entrusted with the duty of guarding the entrances)."
"Against the approach of the enemy forces there, the draw-bridges are protected by
the aforesaid engines and the enemy-battalions are flung into the moats on every side."
"The most important draw-bridge which is unshakable, firmly fastened very well and
strong, is dazzling with numerous gold pillars and pedestals."
"Ravana, inclined to war and endowed with powers of the state, himself remains alert
and in readiness to review the forces, Oh, Rama!"
"Lanka therefore is impregnable, it is a celestial citadel, that inspires terror.
Surrounded by water and built on a mountain, it has four fold defenses including forest and
artificial fortification."
"Lanka is situated on the other side of the ocean, which is difficult of access, Oh
Rama! It offers no passage for vehicles either and there is no proper communication from all
sides."
"That city of Lanka, resembling the city of Gods, is built on a mountain peak and is
inaccessible. That Lanka is abound with horses and elephants and is extremely difficult to
conquer."
Deep trenches and Sataghnis too as well as engines of war of every kind adorn Lanka
the city of wicked Ravana."
"Ten thousand ogres all carrying darts in their hands and warriors contending with
swords, who are difficult to assail, are positioned at the eastern gate."
"One hundred thousand of ogres, with an army of four limbs (viz. horses, foot
soldiers, elephants and chariots) are positioned at the southern gate of the city. Warriors
unsurpassed by others constitute that army."
One million troops arrived with shields and swords as well as proficient in the use
of all mystic missiles, are positioned at the western gate."
"A hundred millions of ogres, who are mounted in chariots or who ride on hoses, sons
of distinguished families and greatly honored, are positioned there at the northern gate."
"Moreover, ogres hundreds of thousands in number, difficult to attack, aggregating
to one and quarter of a crore of ogres are positioned at the central division."
"Those bridges were broken by me and the moats were filled up (with the wreckage).
The city of Lanka was burnt by me and the defensive walls were pulled down. A part of the army of
the gigantic ogres was destroyed."
"By some way or other, let us cross the ocean. The city of Lanka should be assumed
then as destroyed by the monkeys."
"Oh, Rama! What is the use for the rest of the forces to you? Angada, Divida,
Mainda, Jambavan, Panasa, Anala and Nila the commander-in-chief alone, by reaching that great city
of Ravana leaping and storming Lanka with its mountains and woods, moats and archways, protective
walls and buildings, will recover Seetha."
"Order quickly to get all the forces accumulated accordingly. Let us set out at the
appropriate moment."The people devoted to the high- soled Rama of unfailing bravery accompanied him on his way to the forest for exile.
When the king was forced (in the interests of his son) to turn back, the group of
friends who were following Rama's chariot did not return.
Rama who enjoyed great celebrity and who was richly endowed with every virtue,
resembling the full moon, had indeed become the favorite for the people living in Ayodhya.
Despite the entreaties of the people of his own, Rama(the scion of the Kakutstha), in order to honor his father's vow; proceeded towards the forest.
Fondly gazing on the people as though drinking with his eyes, Rama lovingly spoke
(as follows) as though they were his own children:
"The respect and affection that has been bestowed upon me by you (the residents of Ayodhya) may for my satisfaction be bestowed in a special measure on Bharata.
"Bharata who enhances the delight of Kaikeyi and who possesses excellent conduct,
will indeed do pleasing and beneficial things to you appropriately."
"Bharata who is matured in knowledge but young in age, who is gentle but endowed
with virility and virtue, will become your worthy master who can dispel your fears"
"Bharata who is endowed with royal virtues is being marked as the prince. Further, king's command is to be carried out by me and the rest of you.
"If you desire to please me, see that the king does not suffer agony when I have
gone to forest for exile"
The more Rama the son of Dasaratha, showed himself to be faithful to his duty, the more the people wished to have him as their master "
Rama accompanied by son of Sumitra, drew the people of the city, who were weeping
piteously, after him as if tied and pulled with cords.
Those brahmanas, who were triply revered for their learning, their age and their
spirituality, their heads shaking with advanced years, cried out :
"Oh Noble Steeds, of speedy breed! You who are carrying Rama, do come back! Do not proceed! Be friendly to your master (since by taking Rama against our wishes, you will be doing a disservice to him)"
"Indeed all things, which are endowed with ears, more so horses, stand appraised of our entreaty. Therefore, you return."
"That hero of the pure soul, of virtuous and auspicious firm resolve, that master, deserves to be brought back to the city and not to be taken to the forest."
Seeing those aged brahmanas uttering those painful words, Rama quickly got down from the chariot.
Rama with Sita and Lakshmana, taking close strides, proceeded on foot towards the
forest.
That Rama who was affectionate in his disposition and had compassion in his eyes,
could not abandon those brahmanas walking on foot, far behind the chariot.
Perceiving Rama still going towards the forest, those brahmanas perplexed in mind
and greatly distressed, spoke the following words :
"The whole of this brahmana community is following you, devoted (as you are) to the brahmanas. See, they are bearing the sacred fires on their shoulders"
"Look at these canopies (obtained by us while observing Vajpeya sacrifice*)
accompanying our backs like clouds at the end of the rainy season"
"With these canopies of ours, we shall give shade to you, who have got no canopy and are being scored with rays (of the sun.)"
"Oh, Dear child! The intellect of ours, which was forever engaged in perusing the
study of Vedic texts has been now made to follow the course of exile to the forest"
"We will carry the Vedas in our hearts as our excellent treasure and our wives too will remain at home, protected by their character"
"We shall not revoke our decision. Our mind is fully determined to go along with you (to the forest). If you do not pay attention to piety, what being will remain devoted to the path of virtue?"
" Oh, prince of resolute conduct! We entreat you by our heads having gray hair like the white color of the swans, that are soiled with dust as a result of their falling on the ground (in the course of our prostration to you) (pray) turn back."
"Sacrifices have been commenced by many of those Brahmanas that have come here.
Their completion, oh dear child, depends on your return"
"Beings both animate and inanimate, Oh, Rama, are indeed devoted to you. Show
affection to those devotees, who entreat you to return."
"The trees held by their roots, unable to accompany you, seen to be weeping,
hump-backed by the force of wind"
"Birds too, which sit motionless and are unable to go out in search of food and
which remain fixed at one spot on trees, are supplicating you to return, compassionate as you are to all created beings"
While those brahmanas were crying thus with a view to persuading Rama to return, the river Tamasa appeared there, as though retarding the progress of Rama "
Thereafter Sumantra the charioteer too released the horses, tired as they were, from the chariot and quickly making them roll, allowed them to graze not very far from the (bank of) Tamasa once they had drunk water and had their body washed in the river."Rejoicing for achieving the result of their journey with Vishvamitra, the brave 
Rama and Lakshmana then resided in that hermitage for that night, gladdening in 
their heart of hearts. 
When that night turned into a new day, performing their morning chores both of the 
brother jointly approached Sage Vishvamitra, who is along with other sages by then. 

And those gentle-speakers on reverencing that eminent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance 
is akin to the ritual-fire, they two spoke this highly courteous sentence to him. 

"Oh, tigerly-sage, here are your attendants sir, available in your attendance, what 
order is to be carried out further, oh, eminent saint, that you may order us. 
When they have said that way all those great sages spoke to Rama, keeping Vishvamitra 
at the helm of affairs. 
"Oh, best one among men, a highly righteous Vedic ritual belonging to King Janaka 
of Mithila is going to take place, and we the sages are going over there. 
"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, if you can come along with us, it will be expedient for you 
to see a monumental gem of bow there. 
"Oh, best one among men, in early times indeed gods gave that awesome bow which 
has an unimaginable power and which is superbly incandescent in wars to an erstwhile 
king of Mithila in a congregation of a Vedic-ritual. 
"Gods cannot capably lift it to string; gandharva-s, no; asura-s, no; demons, no; 
and for human beings, not in any way. 
"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great 
mighty princes are rendered incapable to string its bowstring. 
"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, there in Mithila you can see that particular bow of the great-souled 
king of Mithila and his highly admirable Vedic ritual too, if you come with us. 

"Once Devaraata, the grandparent of the present king Janaka of Mithila, conducted 
a Vedic-ritual and he indeed prayed only for this supreme bow with a best grip-handle 
as the fruit of that ritual from all of the gods and oh, tigerly man Rama, he got 
the same from them. 
"That bow has got a regular worship and especially during the periods ofdhanur utsava-s, festivals of bows-and- arrows. Hence 
it is kept in the palace of King of Mithila, and oh, Raghava it is worshipped with 
a variety of sandalwood pastes, scents of aloe substance, and with incenses." 
Saying so that best saint Vishvamitra started to travel on along with the assemblages 
of sages, and even along with Rama and Lakshmana, whose tacit consent to follow 
the sage is obtained by now, and on bidding farewell to the deities of woodlands 
of that Accomplished Hermitage, where his ritual is accomplished with the help of 
Rama and Lakshmana. 
"Adieu, georgic deities, everything bodes well to you all, on accomplishment of 
the ritual I have undertaken here, I wish to go from this Accomplished Hermitage 
towards the ranges of Himalayan Mountains that are on the northern bank of River 
Ganga." 
Thus saying farewell to woodland-deities that descendent of Kaushika, namely Vishvamitra, 
the saint whose wealth is his ascesis started to journey on aiming to reach the 
northern side of River Ganga. 
While that best saint set forth, the team of his close followers who are the advocators 
of Vedic canons have moved behind him, approximately with a hundred carts loaded 
with their ritual paraphernalia. 
Even the residents of that Hermitage of Accomplishment, namely animals and birds, 
closely followed that great-souled Vishvamitra, whose wealth is his ascesis, in 
herds and flocks. But that sage Vishvamitra made those flocks of birds and the herds 
of animals to return to their places, as they have shown enough courtesy. 
Those assemblages of sages on going far on their path made a camp on the bank of 
River Sona when the sun is dangling towards west. 
When the sun went into dusk those sages with illimitable resplendence took their 
bath and on kindling the consumer of kindled oblations they completed their evening 
fire ritual, and then squatted before sage Vishvamitra. 
And even Rama along with Lakshmana on worshipping those sages squatted before that 
intellectual Vishvamitra. 
With growing inquisitiveness that resplendent Rama has asked the tigerly sage Vishvamitra 
whose wealth is his ascesis. 
"Oh, godly sage, this place is glistening with well-developed woodlands, really 
what is this place? You be blest! It will be apt of you tell about it, in essence." 
Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra.
Sage Vishvamitra whose vows are unselfish and whose ascesis is exalted is motivated 
with the words of Rama and staying amidst the sages he started to tell all about 
that place. Hearing Rama's words and seeing him clad in a garb of hermit, king Dasaratha with
his wives fell unconscious. Consumed by grief, he could not look towards Rama. Troubled in mind as he was, the king could not speak to Rama by seeing into his face.
The mighty armed Dasaratha was unconscious for some time, distressed and repented in various ways thinking of Rama alone.
"I think that previously many people were separated from their children by me or in any case many living beings were killed. Hence, this (calamity) has befallen me."
"life does not decamp from the body surely without the arrival of time. Death does not claim me, even being tormented by Kaikeyi and eventhough I behold my son, efflugent as fire, standing before me clad in the robes of an ascetic having cast off his fine garments."
"All these people are suffering on account of only Kaikeyi, who sought refuge in
chincanery, with an implicit intent of selfishness"
Having uttered these words and saying "Oh, Rama!" only once, he was not able to
speak any more, his organs of voice being choked by tears.
Regaining consciousness after a moment, the king, with his eyes filled with tears, spoke these words to Sumantra:
"You come with a chariot, fit for driving, yoked with excellent horses and take this highly distinguished prince beyond this territory."
"Since a pious and a valiant son is being sent to exile by father and mother, I
think such is said to be the reward of virtues of the virtueous."
Sumantra obeying the words of the king, walked away quickly and arrived there fitted with horses, a chariot duly decorated.
The charioteer told the prince with joined palms about that chariot decorated by
gold, fitted wih superb horses.
The king, who knew what should be done at a proper place and time and was clear by all means, quickly called an officer placed in charge of the treasury and spoke in a decisive tone (as follows);-
"Quickly bring for Seetha, clothings of great worth and ornaments of high quality, taking into consideration all these years (that Seetha has to spend in exile) After thus spoken by the king, the officer went to the treasury, brought all that in a lot and gave to Seetha.
Setting out as she was to the forest, Seetha of noble birth adorned her beautiful
limbs with those wonderful jewels.
Seetha, beautifully adorned as she was, illumined that palace, as the sky in a
morning is illuminated by a rising sun.
Embracing in her arms that princess of Mithila, who never behaved in self-pity, and smelling her head(as a token of affection), her mother-in-law(Kausalya) spoke as follows: "Dishonest women, eventhough adored all the time by their husbands, cease to esteem their husband who has come to pass into evil days, throughout this world."
"Having enjoyed happiness in the past, they become spoiled and even desert their
husband, on obtaining even the least misfortune: such is the nature of (bad) women."
"Young women, who are evil-minded, are untruthful in their disposition, are affected by passion and their essence, incomprehensible. They get aversion within a moment."
Neither a noble descent, nor an accomplishment, nor learning, nor a gift nor even
entertainment can capture the heart of women. They are unstbale of their heart indeed!"
"But, for women established in good conduct, truthfulness, sacred learning and
mental quietness, their husband alone is the most sacred entity, the best of all."
"My son who is being sent to the forest should not be despised by you. Even if he is invested with riches or without riches, let him be a deity to you."
perceiving her words, endowed with essence of righteousness and joining her palms, Seetha replied to her mother-in-law standing in front of her, as follows:-
"I shall do just all that, as your venerable self instructs me. I know how I should behave towards my husband. I have also heard about it earlier."
"Your venerable self is not worthy of equating me with evil women. I am unable to
deviate from virtue, even as a moon from the moonlight"
"Vina (Indian lute) does not resonate without chords. Chariot does not move without wheels. Now can a wife bereft of her husband, even if blessed with hundred children, will not lie happily in comfort."
"A father indeed gives a limited extent, a mother in a limited measure and a son in moderation. Which woman, then, would not adore her husband, the bestower of unlimitedness!"
"Having heard about the special and ordinary duties of a wife from the most
excellent women, how can I, as such, despise my husband, Oh venerable lady? Husband is indeed a deity to women."
Hearing Seetha's words, which touched her heart, Kausalya of pure mind suddenly
started shedding tears born of agony and delight.
Rama, the most virtuous man, joining his palms, approached and spoke these words to his mother, who is highly respected among all his mothers:
"Oh, mother! You do not grieve. You look after my father. The end of exile will come rather soon."
"Fourteen years will elapse, while you are asleep. you as such, will see me, duly
arrived here in my entire being, surrounded by my well-wishers."
Uttering the aforesaid words of such quality and appropriate meaning to his mother, Rama thought once again and gazed at his three hundred and fifty step-mothers.
Rama joined his palms and saluted those step mothers also, who were too distressed in the same way and spoke these words which were in consonance with the spirit of righteousness.
"Please excuse me, if I have done any mistake either becuase of our living together or due to ignorance on my part. I now take leave of you all."
All those women, whose mind was overpowered with grief, heard the aforesaid cool
submission of Rama, which was in consonance with righteousness.
While Rama was speaking thus, an outery, resembling the wail of female cranes arose from those wives of Dasaratha.
Dasaratha' s palace, which was earlier resounding with tomtoms, large drums and
Meghas( musical instruments which sound like rumbling of clouds) was now filled with wails and cries and fallen on evil days.Seeing the marks of conflict on the person of Sugreeva, Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana 
after embracing Sugreeva spoke these words.
"Without consulting me closely, such a reckless act has been done by you, such a rashness 
is not seemly in a king."
"O, warrior longing for acts of daring! This wrong and reckless act has been done by 
you, causing me, this army and Vibhishana great anxiety."
"O, warrior! O, vanquisher of foes! Do not act thus in future. O, the mighty armed! O, 
annihilator of enemies! If you have come by some misfortune, I would have had nothing to do with Seetha, 
Bharata, Lakshmana or still younger Shatrughna or even with my own person."
"O, monkey of great strength, equal to Indra the god of celestials and Varuna the king 
of universe! If you have not returned, though I am conversant with your valour, this was my pre-determined 
resolve that having killed Ravana in fight with his sons forces and chariots, I should have installed 
Vibhishana as king of Lanka, placing the kingdom of Ayodhya in the hands of Bharata and renounced my 
life."
Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva replied as follows: "O, brave Rama! Seeing Ravana who 
had taken away your consort and being conscious of my own strength, how can I act otherwise?"
Complimenting that hero Sugreeva who was thus speaking, Rama addressed Lakshmana, who 
was endowed with auspicious marks, saying:
"O, Lakshmana! Beside these fresh waters and trees laden with fruit, let us divide this 
multitude of troops, drawing it up in a battle array and remain alert."
"I foresee a terrible calamity to come, boding universal destruction and death to the 
intrepid bears, monkeys and demons."
"Harsh winds blow. The earth trembles. Mountain-peaks shake and the elephants bearing 
the earth trumpet."
"Sinister clouds prey-roar violently like carnivorous animals and let fall a rain mixed 
with drops of blood."
"The dusk, red as sandal, is full of horror and from the sun, this blazing mass of fire 
falls."
"Wile beasts and birds emit frantic cries, ill at ease and ominous, inspiring great fear, 
facing the sun."
"The moon shorn of its radiance, surrounded by black and fiery rays, burns red as at 
the time of destruction of the word and is creating an anguish in the night."
"O, Lakshmana! In the disk of the sun, a small halo with a black mark, fiery, shorn of 
its radiance and of coppery hue is seen."
"O, Lakshmana! The stars are not appearing as they should be duly foretelling their intention 
to hasten a final dissolution of the world."
"Crows, eagles and vultures are whirling round at a lower level. Jackals too are howling 
inauspicious sounds."
"The earth, crowded with rocks, darts and daggers discharged by monkeys and demons, will 
become a slime of flesh and blood."
"Now surrounded by the monkeys from all sides, let us make an attack on that invincible 
citadel ruled by Ravana quickly and swiftly."
Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the heroic Rama of great strength climbed down from that 
mountain-peak.
Having descended from that mountain, Rama, whose mind was set on righeousness, held a 
review of his own army, which was verily difficult to conquer for the enemies.
Rama, who knew the fitting moment to act, along with Sugreeva made ready the great army 
and commanded the army to advance, at the appropriate moment for the battle.
Rama, the mighty armed, together with the mighty army marched in front, wielding a bow, 
towards the city of Lanka, at the befitting moment.
Then, Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Hanuman, Jambavan the king of bears, Nala, Nila and Lakshmana 
accompanied that Rama.
Thereafter, fully covering a vast stretch of land, the great army of bears and monkeys, 
followed in the wake of Rama.
Monkeys, the annihilator of enemies, resembling elephants, took hold of mountain-peaks 
and hundreds of well-grown huge trees.
Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the destroyers of their adversaries, reached the 
city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, in not a long time.
The monkeys, encouraged by the sound of Rama's voice and obedient to his command, halted 
before the city of Lanka, garlanded with banners, beautiful and splendid with pleasure-gardens, having 
an unusual rampart which is inaccessible with its elevated arched door-ways and invincible even by the 
celestials.
Reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, the heroic Rama the son of Dasaratha accompanied 
by Lakshmana, halted near the northern gate, where Ravana stayed. Who else but Rama is capable of protecting 
the army besieging that gate, regulated by Ravana, as an ocean, regulated by Varuna, guarded by awful 
demons on all sides and creating fear to the weak as a subterranean region is guarded by demons?
Rama saw various types and multitude of weapons and shields kept there by the warriors.
Nila, the valiant army-chief of monkeys together with Mainda and Dvivida reached and 
halted before the Eastern gate.
Angada of very mighty prowess, together with Rishhabha, Gavaksha, Gaja and Gavaya took 
charge of the Southern gate.
The strong monkey Hanuman together with Prajangha, Tarasa and other warriors, guarded 
the western gate.
Sugreeva, along with all the chiefs of monkeys equal to the strength of Garuda (the eagle 
and the vehicle of Vishnu) as well as Vayu the god of the wind, was stationed himself in the middle 
of the fort.
Thirty six crores of monkeys, highly renowned generals stood besiezed, where the monkey 
Sugreeva was there, having exerted pressure on the demons occupying that post.
Meanwhile, under Rama's command, Lakshmana along with Vibhishana distributed a crore 
each of his monkeys at each gate.
Behind Rama and not far from him, Sushena together with Jambavan, followed by a multitude 
of forces, stood at the intermediate post.
Those lions among the monkeys, possessing the teeth of tigers, taking hold of trees and 
rocks, waited delightedly for the signal to fight.
All of them were lashing their tails feverishly, using their jaws and nails as weapons, 
trembling in every limb and had their faces set grimly.
Some were having the strength of ten elephants, some a ten times of that and some were 
equal to the strength of a thousand elephants.
Some were having the strength of an ogha* of elephants. Some were endowed with a strength 
of ten times to that. some others there were chiefs of monkeys, having an immeasurable strength.
Marvellous and astonishing was the gathering of those troops of monkeys there, like a 
swarm of locusts.
By the monkeys who reached Lanka and by those stationed already beneath its walls, the 
air and earth seem to be completely filled.
A hundred divisions of one lakh each of bears and monkeys poured towards the gates of 
Lanka, while others proceeded to fight on every side.
Those monkeys covered the mountain on every side. A crore of them ranged round that city.
Even winds were unable to penetrate Lanka being surrounded on all sides by heroic monkeys 
holding tree trunks in their hands.
The demons, who in their valour equaled Indra the ruler of gods, seeing themselves besieged, 
as by clouds, were struck with sudden terror.
While the flock of monkey- troops was advancing there, a tremendous clamour arose, resembling 
a roar in the ocean beating against its shore.
By that great tumult, the entire Lanka with its ramparts arches, hills, woods and forests 
began to tremble.
That army of monkeys, guarded by Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva became even more invinceible 
than all the celestials and demons put together.
Having thus ranged his forces, with a view to destroy the demons, Rama who knew about 
the four expedients (to be used against an enemy in the shape of conciliation, gift, sowing dissension 
and punishment) employed in succession, took counsel again and again with his ministers and arrived 
at a decision. Calling to his mind the duty of the kings, Rama who was eager to undertake what was to 
be done next, in concurrence with Vibhishana, summoned Angada the son of Vali and spoke as follows:
"Go my gentle Angada on my behalf and, passing thought the city of Lanka without fear 
and anxiety and Lanka without fear and anxiety and approaching Ravana - the unfortunate demon devoid 
of sovereignty and who has lost his splendour because of his inclination to die - admonish him in the 
following words:"
"O, Ravana the Ranger of the Night! In your reckless arrogance, sages, celestials, celestial 
musicians and their wives, serpent - demons, yakshas the semi-divine beings and kings have been oppressed 
by you. From now on, that arrogance, born of the boon you received from Brahma the Lord of creation, 
shall be subdued."
"I shall inflict a fitting penalty for your ruthless abduction of my consort. I am stationed 
myself at the gate of Lanka, with a Rod of chastisement."
"O, demon! Slain by me, you will attain the region of Gods, of all the great sages and 
all the royal sages."
"O, the worst demon! Demonstrate the same courage and magic that you did employ in bearing 
Seetha away from me."
"If you do not make an appeal to my clemency by returning Seetha, I shall make this world 
devoid of all demons."
"This pious minded Vibhishana, the foremost of demons has come to me. Surely, this illustrious 
demon will obtain the kingdom of Lanka, which will henceforth be free from troubles."
"You, without a knowledge of the self and a sinful demon having stupid followers around 
you, cannot indeed enjoy the kingdom even for a moment, by this unrighteousness."
"O, demon! Otherwise, get ready for a battle, by gathering courage and laying hold of 
your valour. Having been slain by my arrows in combat, you will be laid in peace.
"O, Ranger of the Night! Even if you range the three worlds in the forms of a bird, you 
will not return alive, when you come into my range of sight."
"I give you this salutary counsel prepare for your obsequies. Let Lanka be obliged to 
be seen well by you (like your last sight), as your survival is in my hands."
Hearing the words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, Angada the son of Tara, leapt 
into air like a god of fire personified and marched ahead.
Reaching Ravana's palace in an instant, the illustrious Angada saw Ravana, seated coolly 
along with his ministers.
Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, wearing golden bracelets, descended close to the 
king and stood there like a flaming torch.
Having made himself known, Angada communicated, that whole of the excellent speech of 
Rama without adding or subtracting anything to Ravana in the presence of Ravana's ministers, saying:
"I am the son of Vali, Angada by name. I have come as a messenger for the king of Koshala, 
Rama of imperishable exploits. Has my name ever reached your ears?"
"Rama who is born in Raghu dynasty and who augements the joy of Kausalya speaks thus 
to you,  O, ruthless demon! Come forth and enter into combat. Prove to be the representative of your 
race!' "
"  I shall kill you along with your ministers, sons, cousins and other relatives. You 
being dead, all the three worlds will be rid of fear.'"
"  Now, I shall uproot you, a thorn to sages and an enemy to celestials, demons, semi-divine 
beings, celestial musicians, serpent-gods and ogres'."
"If you do not restore Seetha honourably, by bowing respectfully before me, you are slain 
and Vibhishana will become the king.'"
Hearing these harsh words from Angada the lion among the monkeys, Ravana the Lord of 
the demon-tribe was infuriated.
Then, the enraged Ravana repeatedly commanded his attendants, saying: "Let this stupid 
monkey be seized and put to death."
Hearing Ravana's words, four terrible demons seized Angada who, in his splendour, resembled 
a blazing torch.
Then, the prudent and heroic Angada the son of Tara voluntarily allowed himself to be 
seized, in order to display his prowess before the host of demons.
Then, seizing like unto birds those attendants clung to his arms, Angada leapt on to 
the palace that resembled like a mountain.
All those four demons were shaken out by Angada's impetuous leap and fell on the ground 
there under the eyes of their king.
Thereafter, the glorious Angada the son of Vali ascended the roof of Ravana's palace, 
which equaled the summit of a mountain in height.
That roof of the palace, trampled by Angada, crumbled - as a peak of Himalayan range 
was shattered long ago by lightening - before Ravana's gaze.
After destroying the roof of the palace, Angada proclaimed his name and with a triumphant 
roar, rose into the air.
Causing restlessness to all the demons but delight to the monkeys, Angada approached 
close to Rama, who was stationed in the middle of the monkey-forces.
Because of the destruction of his palace, Ravana on his part got extremely angry. Foreseeing 
his own destruction, he became a desponded demon.
Surrounded by many monkeys, roaring with delight, Rama on his part was proceeding ahead 
already for the battle, with an intent to wipe out the enemy.
Now, Sushena the highly valiant monkey, was stationed there like the head of the mountain 
surrounded by innumerable monkeys, who were bale to change their form at will.
Under the order of Sugreeva, the invincible monkey, Sushena was patrolling the gates 
and wandering like a moon among the stars.
Seeing hundreds of divisions of those monkeys encamped under the walls of Lanka, marshaled 
on the shores of the sea, the demons were amazed and some others were terror-struck while others, overjoyed 
at the prospect of fighting, leapt even in exultation.
Those miserable demons saw the entire extensive space between the walls and the moat 
being occupied by the monkeys, like unto a second rampart. The demons cried out, "Woe! Alas!" in panic.
As a result of that appalling tumult in the capital city of the demons, the soldiers 
of Ravana seized hold of their great weapons and sallied forth like the winds that blow at the dissolution 
of the worlds.Hearing those words of Vibhishana, Rama, agonized as he was with grief, could not
understand clearly what was spoken by that demon.
Then, Rama the conqueror of the cities of enemies, leaning upon his courage, spoke
to Vibhishana who was sitting nearby and in front of the monkeys (as follows):
"O lord of demons! I wish to hear again those of the words spoken by you. I desire
to hear again, whatever you intend to tell me."
Hearing those words of Rama, spoken very sadly, that Vibhishana who was skilled in
expression, again spoke his words gently as follows:
"O the long armed hero! Immediately after your orders, the marshalling of the troops
was done by me in the manner as enjoined by you."
"All those armies were divided and positioned at all places. Even the commanders of
those divisions were arrayed and distributed according to their ranks."
"O great lord! I have to report to you something further. Listen to it. While you
are lamenting without any cause, we feel painful at our hearts."
"O king! Abandon this lamentation and false grief which came to you. Let your worry,
which augments the pleasure of your adversaries be therefore abandoned."
"O hero! If you want to get back Seetha and if the demons are to be destroyed, raise
up for the occasion. Keep yourself cheerful."
"O Rama! Listen to my benign words I tell you. This Lakshmana together with a large
army should go soon to kill Indrajit, who reached Nikumbhila, with arrows as deadly as the
serpentine poison released from his snake-like bow in battle."
"By his penance, Indrajit obtained a weapon called Brahmashira, by way of a gift
from Brahma and also horses, which are coursing at his will."
"That Indrajit, as such along with his army, is reported to have reached Nikumbhila.
If he comes forth after completing his sacrificial act, know that all of us as killed."
"A boon was given by Brahma to that intelligent demon as follows: "O Indrajit! That
enemy of yours, who strikes while you are marching with your bow drawn, and while you have not
arrived at Nikumbhila, or even while you have not offered oblations to the sacred fire, will prove
to be the cause of your killing."
"O mighty Rama! Give your command for killing of Indrajit. When he is killed, know
that Ravana along with his associate troops also as killed."
Hearing the words of Indrajit, Rama then spoke the following words:"O Vibhishana of
true prowess! I know the conjuring trick of that terrific demon."
"That Indrajit is skilled in the use of the mystic missile presided over by Brahma.
He is intelligent. He is a master of several conjuring tricks. He is so mighty that he can render
unconscious in battle even the gods along with Varuna the king of gods."
"O highly illustrious hero! While he drifts in the sky, ascending his chariot, his
movement is not known to others, as the sun is not seen beneath a dense mass of clouds."
Having known the toughness of the conjuring tricks of the evil-minded adversary,
Rama spoke to the illustrious Lakshmana as follows:
"O Lakshmana! You, accompanied by that entire army which stands at the disposal of
Sugreeva, along with troop-commanders with Hanuma as their head; and protected by Jambavan the lord
of bears, who will be accompanied by his army, kill that Indrajit the prince of demons, rich in the
power of conjuring tricks."
"The great souled Vibhishana, who knows all the conjuring tricks of Indrajit, along
with his counsellors, will follow behind you."
Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana of highly wonderful prowess, along with
Vibhishana, took hold of his excellent bow.
The rejoiced Lakshmana who was prepared for the combat, clad in an armour, wielding
a sword and arrows, wearing his bow in his left hand and having touched Rama's feet in salutation,
spoke as follows:
"Today, the arrows released from my bow, piercing Indrajit, will drop into the City
of Lanka, as swans descend into a louts-pond.
"Now itself, my arrows discharged from the bow-string of this great bow, duly
splitting his terrific body, will blow him away."
Thus speaking in front of his brother, that resplendent Lakshmana, quickly marched
forward, with an intent to kill Indrajit.
Offering salutation to the feet of his brother and doing circumambulation too, that
Lakshmana went to the sanctuary named Nikumbhila, which was protected by Indrajit.
Having obtained the blessings from his brother, the glorious Lakshmana, the prince,
quickly sallied forth along with Vibhishana.
Then, Hanuma accompanied by many a thousand of monkeys and Vibhishana along with his
counsellors went behind Lakshmana.
That Lakshmana, quickly surrounded by a large army of monkeys, saw the army of
Jambavan also stationed in the way.
After covering a long distance, that Lakshmana, the delight to his friends, saw the
army of Ravana, ranged in battle-array, from a distance.
Duly arriving at Nikumbhila, that foe-conquering Lakshmana stood, bow in hand, to
conquer that Indrajit, the possessor of conjuring tricks, in conformity with Brahma's
ordinance.
The valiant Lakshmana stood there along with Vibhishana, the heroic Angada and
Hanuma, the son of wind-god.
Lakshmana penetrated that heterogeneous army of enemies, resplendent with spotless
weapons, thick with ensigns and abounded with huge chariots, exceedingly impenetrable, very
terrific, with unimaginable swiftness, even as one would enter a thick veil of darkness.Having dwelt for some time in that mountain, Rama, who resembled God, who liked
mountains and groves, who desired Seetha's happiness and himself delightful in his mind, began to point out the beauty of Chitrakuta to his consort, as Indra the god of celestials converses with Shachi the wife of Indra, saying:
"O, my good lady! By seeing this beautiful mountain, neither the loss of kingdom nor the non-existence of friends distresses my mind."
"O, my good lady! Behold this mountain, abounding with flocks of birds of every kind where minerals lie and crowned with peaks that seem to project upwards to the sky."
"Some areas of the mountain are encrusted with minerals, having appearance of
silver, some resembling blood, some yellowish, some red as madder, some sparkle like precious stones, some possessing, the luster of topaz and crystal and a hue of Ketaka flower and some sparkle with the splendour of a kind of gem called Jyotirasa."
"The mountain is filled with tame beasts of every kind, tigers, panthers and bears, and is enlivened by a flock of many birds."
"This mountain abounds with such type of trees as mangoes, rose-apples and Asanas
laden with flowers and fruits, affording magnificient shade, and pleasing to the mind, Lodhras, Priyalas (commonly called Payals), bread-fruit trees, Dhavas, Ankolas, Bhavyas and Tinisas, Bilvas (Bel trees), Tindukas and bamboos, Kashmaris, margosas and Varaas, Madhukas; Tilaks, jujube trees, emblic myrobalans, Kadamoos, came, Dhanvanas and pomegranates, enhancing its beauty."
"O, my good lady! See these Kinnaras, thrilling to be looked at, in their high
spirits, wandering in couples in these lovely mountain-plains."
"Behold their swords hanging on the trees, their excellent swords and the charming retreats, where vidyadharas and their women sport."
"This mountain resembles an elephant with ichors flowing from its forehead, as from its crevices, springs and cascades flow here and there."
"Who would not be filled with delight, by these glades from which fragrance of
various flowers issues, pleasing to the senses?"
"O, irreproachable lay! If I am live with you and Lakshmana for many autumns here, grief will not overpower me."
"O, Seetha! Seeing this mountain laden with many flowers and fruit, the enchanting resort of flocks of birds as also the ravishing peaks of the mountain, I am really captivated."
"By residing in the forest, a two-fold advantage is secured by me; freedom from debt to my father in regards my duty and Bharata's happiness."
"O, Seetha! Are you happy with me on this Chitrakuta mountain, seeing various
objects agreeable to your thought word and temperament?"
"My paternal great grand fathers the ancient royal sages have said that for a king to obtain liberation after death, such a residence in the forest is nectar like."
"Hundreds and multitude of rocks of this extensive mountain are shining around in
multifarious colours like blue, yellow, white and red."
"Thousands of herbs of this Chitrakuta mountain, glittering with their lovely light, are sparkling like points of fire."
"O, Seetha! Some parts of this mountain resemble mansions, some look like parks and some others appear like a single pile."
"Chitrakuta appears as though emerged, having split the earth. This summit of
Chitrakuta appears charming on all sides."
"See the leaves of lilies, Sthagara trees, Punnaga trees and Bhurja trees heaped
with flowers of water-lilies form the cozy beds of voluptuaries."
"O, Seetha! Look at the garlands of lotus-flowers crushed and thrown aside by
voluptuaries as also fruits of every kind that have been tasted."
"This mountain f Chitrakuta with its abundance of roots fruits and water is more
beautiful than Vasvankasara better known as Alaka the capital of Kubera the Lord of Riches, Nalini the capital of Indra (the God of celestials) better known as Amaravati and Uttarakuru the country of Eternal Beatitude."
"O, Seetha! Strolling with you and Lakshmana during this period of exile, on my part established in the path of the pious, following the highest salutary practices, I shall obtain joy, enhancing the piety of my race."
As approved by Rama, that excellent aerial car, with images of swan painted on it,
flew into the sky, with a great sound.
Casting his look on all sides, Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, then spoke to
Seetha, who had a moon-like face (as follows):
"O Seetha! Look at the City of Lanka, resting firmly on the mount of Trikuta,
looking like a peak of Mount Kailasa and built by Viswarakarma, the universal architect."
"O Seetha! Look at this great battle-field, covered with a mud of flesh and blood as
also a cause for the death of monkeys and demons."
"O the large-eyed Seetha! Here lies Ravana, the king of demons, the tormentator of
people, on whom boons were conferred by Brahma and who was killed by me for your sake."
"Here, Kumbhakarna and Prahasta the demon were killed. Here, Dhumraksha was killed
by Hanuma, the monkey."
"Here was Vidyunmali killed by the great-souled Sushena and here was Indrajit, the
son of Ravana, killed by Lakshmana in a combat."
"Here was killed a demon called Vikata by Angada. Virupaksha, who was disagreeable
to the sight, Mahaparsva, Mahodara, Akampana, Trishiras, Atikaya Devantaka, Narantaka and other
mighty demons were also killed here."
"Both Yuddonmatta and Matta, the foremost of demons, as also Nikumbha and Kumbha the
sons of Kumbhakarna, as also the strong Vajradamshtra, Damshtra and many demons were killed.
Makaraksha, the most difficult demon to be attacked, was struck down by me in this
battle-field."
"Akampana was killed in the great battle. The valiant Shonitaksha was also killed.
Yupaksa and Prajangha were killed."
"Here, Vidyujjihva, the demon was a terrific appearance, was killed. Yajnashatru
also was killed. The mighty Suptaghna was killed. Surya shatru was killed and another demon called
Brahma shatru was too killed."
"Here, surrounded by more than a thousand fellow-wives, Ravana's wife named
Mandodari lamented for Ravana."
"O Seetha, the lovely-faced one! Here is seen a water-descent of the ocean on the
sea-shore, where having crossed the ocean, we spent that night."
"O the large-eyed Seetha! Here is the bridge called Nala Setu, which was so
difficult to execute for others, got built by me over the salt-sea for your sake."
"O Seetha! See this roaring imperturbable and seemingly boundless ocean, the
habitation of Varuna (the god of waters), which is teeming well with couches and
oyster-shells."
"O Seetha! See the golden mountain, Mainaka (the ruler of mountains) which rose
passing through the ocean, in order to provide rest and relaxation to Hanuma."
"See this island, located in the middle of the ocean, where my troops were
stationed. At this place, the lord Shiva (the supreme deity) formerly bestowed his grace on
me."
"Here is seen the water-descent of the gigantic ocean, called a Setubandha, adored
in all the three worlds. This is very much a sacred spot, capable of washing away major sins. At
this very place, Vibhishana the king of demons first came."
"O Seetha! Here is seen the beautiful City of Sugreeva, Kishkindha, which is full of
colourful groves, where Vali was killed by me."
Seeing the City of Kishkindha, which was earlier ruled by Vali, Seetha, who was
feeling timid through love, then spoke the following courteous words to Rama.
"O king! I wish to reach the capital City of Ayodhya along with you, accompanied by
the wives of other monkey-chiefs with Tara and other beloved wives of Sugreeva."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Rama then said to her in reply "let it be". Reaching
Kishkindha, causing the aerial car to halt, and looking at Sugreeva, Rama spoke to him the
following words:
"O the king of monkeys! Instruct all the monkey-chiefs to come to Ayodhya in the
company of their wives."
"O the mighty Sugreeva, the King of monkeys! You too hasten to depart, taking the
wives of all the monkeys "we shall proceed."
Hearing the words of Rama of great splendour, that illustrious Sugreeva, the lord of
monkeys accompanied by all those monkeys, quickly entering his gynaecium, spoke to Tara as
follows:
"O the beloved lady! You have been permitted by Rama to proceed to Ayodhya, in the
company of the wives of the great-souled monkeys, with an intent to gratify Seetha."
"You hurry up, to proceed to Ayodhya, with the wives of the monkeys. We shall show
Ayodhya and all the widows of Dasaratha to them."
Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Tara, who was charming of every limb, called all the
spouses of the monkeys and spoke to them as follows:
"Duly permitted by Sugreeva and all the monkeys, hurry up to proceed to Ayodhya. A
kindly act will be done to me too, through the sight of Ayodhya (which is so dear to me)."
"We shall also see the entry of Rama into Ayodhya, along with the people of that
city as well as the inhabitants of the country-side, as also the affluence of the widows of
Dasaratha."
Duly permitted by Tara, all the wives of the monkeys, wearing their costumes as per
rule and going round the aerial car clockwise, ascended it with an intent to see Seetha.
Seeing the aerial car having risen quickly, after having taken the wives of monkeys
too, Rama again spoke to Seetha at the vicinity of Mount Rishyamuka (as follows):
"O Seetha! Here is seen Rishyamuka, the excellent mountain, endowed with layers of
gold and looking like a cloud with lightning."
"O Seetha! Here did I meet Sugreeva, the king of monkeys and an agreement too was
made by me for the killing of Vali."
"Here is seen Pampa-river, abounding in lotuses and edged with colourful groves,
where I lamented with great pain, having been separated from you."
"The virtuous Shabari was seen by me at the bank of this river. Here was killed,
Kabandha, having arms, a Yojana (eight miles) long."
"And over there is seen in the forest of Janasthana, O Seetha, that illustrious tree
under which the highly brilliant and mighty Jatayu, the foremost among the birds, was killed by
Ravana, for your sake, O sporting lady!."
"O lady of beautiful complexion! Here is the region, (known as Panchavati, so called
because it consists of five banyan trees) where Khara the demon was killed by me with
straight-going arrows, as also his brothers, Dushana and the mighty Trishiras. And over there is
seen our enchanting leaf-hut, where you were forcibly taken away by Ravana the king of demons, O
charming lady!"
"Here is the shining hermitage of Sutikshna, the great-souled sage. And over there
is seen the great hermitage of Sharabhanga, where the thousand-eyed Indra, the destroyer of
Citadels, came."
"Here is the shining hermitage of Sutikshna, the great-souled sage. And over there
is seen the great hermitage of Sharabhanga, where the thousand-eed Indra, the destroyer of
Citadels, came."
"O slender-waisted lady! Here are seen those sages, where, Atri the head of the
hermitage, was equal in splendour to the sun and the fire."
"At this place, the gigantic Viradha was killed by me. O Seetha! Here was seen by
you, the virtuous Anasuya, the ascetic lady (the wife of sage, Atri)."
"O Seetha, having a beautiful body! Here is Chitrakuta, the excellent mountain,
shining. Bharata came here to seek my favour (in the form of my consent to return to Ayodhya)."
"O Seetha! Here is seen the beautiful river of Yamuna, surrounded by colourful
groves. Here is seen the illustrious hermitage of Sage Bharadwaja."
"Here is seen the holy River Ganga, which wends its way through the three worlds
(viz. heaven, the earth and the subterranean world), whose banks are crowded with flocks of birds
and which is lined with trees in full-flowering."
"Here is the town of Shringaberapura, where Guha my friend stays. Here is seen that
river, Sarayu, lined with rows of sacrificial posts (the relics of sacrifices performed from time
to time by Ikshvaku dynasty), bordered with hundreds of trees and with groves in full blossom."
"O Seetha! Here is seen that Capital City of my father. O the princess of Videha
territory! Having duly returned, offer your salutation to Ayodhya."
Thereupon, all those monkeys and the rejoiced demons along with Vibhishana, at that
time, bounding again and again (to have a glimpse of it) saw that City.
Thereupon, the monkeys along with the demons beheld that Ayodhya, having rows of
white palaces, intersected with wide roads, and crowded with elephants and horses, looking like
Amaravathi, the City of Indra the lord of Celestials.Thrilling with rapture, that charioteer, the charioteer of Ravana, drove forward
quickly, his chariot, a chariot, which was capable of attacking the army of enemies, a wonderful
piece of art like Gandharva-city, an imaginary city in the sky, mounted with flags, yoked with
horses of excellent quality adorned with golden necklaces, filled with war-implements, adorned with
rows of flags and banners, which was devouring the sky as it were, making the earth resound, which
was the destroyer of the army of adversaries and caused delight to its own.
Rama saw that Ravana's chariot, which was coming speedily with a noise, bearing a
large flag-staff, yoked with black horses, endowed with a terrific luster, blazing like an aerial
car in the sky, with a luster of the sun, filled with lightning-like flags and with a beautiful
appearance of a rain-bow.
Seeing that chariot, releasing streams of arrows, like a cloud releasing streams of
rain, with a noise equal to that of a bursting mountain, struck with a diamond, Rama after
stretching his bow in a crescent shape, spoke to Matali, Indra's charioteer as follows:
"O Matali! From the way in which the enemy is marching forward from left to right
with a great speed in his chariot more, it appears that heart has been set by him upon destroying
himself in the battle."
"Therefore, take care and march forward, facing the chariot of the enemy I wish to
destroy it, even as the wind would blow a cloud."
"Without fear and flurry and with a steady heart and vision, and the movement of the
reins fully controlled, drive the chariot swiftly."
"You need not be instructed by me, accustomed as you are to drive the chariot of
Indra the lord of celestials. Keen as I am to fight with a close attention, I am just reminding you
and not teaching you."
Extremely gratified with those words of Rama, that Matali the excellent charioteer
of gods drove on the chariot.
Passing the huge chariot of Ravana on the right, the charioteer then set Ravana
shaking, by the dust risen from the wheels of his own chariot.
The enraged Ravana then, with his coppery eyes wide open, trembled Rama, who stood
facing his chariot, with arrows.
Meeting fortitude with anger, though provoked with assault, Rama took hold of
Indra's bow, which was possessed of extra ordinary impulse in the battle-field.
He also seized hold of arrows of exceeding swiftness, which were shining like
sun-beams. Then began that great battle between the two warriors (Rama and Ravana) who were
desirous of killing each other, while facing each other like two proud lions.
Then, the gods along with the Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas the
demigods and great sages, desirous of Ravana's ruin, arrived to see the battle of both the
chariot-warrriors.
Thereupon, terrific portents that caused one's hair to stand on end, appeared giving
an augury of doom to Ravana and prosperity to Rama.
The god of rains poured blood on Ravana's chariot. Horrible winds blew from right to
left, forming circles.
A large flock of vultures, roaming about in the sky, was flying forward in the same
direction in which Ravana's chariot was going.
Lanka was overcast with dusk, resembling a (red) Japa flower. The land in Lanka, as
also the day appeared as if they were blazing.
Large meteors, along with lightnings fell with great noise. Those entities, inimical
to Ravana, made demons to lament.
The earth on which Ravana was there, trembled. The arms of fighting demons looked as
if they were clasped.
Fallen before Ravana, the rays of the sun appeared coppery, yellow, white and dark,
like mineral ores on a mountain.
The she-jackals followed by vultures hastily uttered inauspicious howls, on
beholding Ravana's face as also vomiting fire from their mouths.
Scattering the dust upwards over the battle-field and clouding the vision of that
Ravana, the wind blew in a direction inimicable to him.
Even without the appearance of clouds, thunderbolts fell on his army on all sides,
with a noise which was hard to endure.
All the quarters and intermediate points of the compass became covered with darkness
and due to outpourings of dust, the sky became difficult to be seen.
Hundreds of dreadful Sarika* birds, with their awful howls, terribly fighting there,
fell down upon Ravana's chariot.
His horses discharged sparks of fire from their hips and loins as also tears from
their eyes, releasing out fire and water at the same time continuously.
Frightful portents in multitude thus sprang up, bringing danger and destruction to
Ravana.
Pleasant and auspicious omens, depicting victory of Rama appeared on all sides,
before Rama.
Seeing the pleasant omens depicting his victory, Rama was very much pleased and
considered Ravana as (already) dead.
Then Rama, with the knowledge of all omens, having seen those portents in his own
way in the battle-field, obtained rejoice as well as extreme happiness and shown enhanced prowess
in combat.Even though Rama is elder to Lakshmana he gleaned the ultimate tenor of Lakshmana's
words when Lakshmana just said them expediently because Raghava is a best gleaner of the gist of
advises. 
Such as he is that dextrous Rama on controlling his highly heightening fury,
propping against his bedazzling bow spoke this to Lakshmana. 
"What is to be done by us, oh, dear boy... or, whereto we might go, or, by which
device Seetha is discernable... Lakshmana, now you think of it, clearly... 
To such a Rama who is tormented by anguish, Lakshmana said, "it will be apt of you
to search this Janasthaana alone which is rife with many demons, and replete with manifold trees
and climber-plants... 
"Here there are unclimbable mountains, glens and glyphs as well. There are divers
and pernicious caverns tumultuous with diverse packs of predators, and here are the mansions of
kinnaraa-s and palaces of gandharva-s, as well... 
"It will be apt of you to steadfastly search in them along with me, and oh, best one
among men, your sort of literati and clever-souls will be unfluctuating in calamities like the
mountains unfluctuating in windstorms..." Lakshmana said so Rama. 
When Lakshmana said in this way to that ireful Rama, he roved entire forest along
with Lakshmana readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his bow. 
Then Rama beheld Jataayu who is akin to a mountaintop in his gleam, and a best
beatific brave bird among all the birds, but bloodstained and buckling on earth. 
On beholding him who is like a mountaintop in his gleam, Rama said to Lakshmana,
"This one has gluttonised Seetha, the princess from Vaidehi, there is no doubt about it...

"It is apparent that this demon skulks in the forest in the semblance of an eagle,
and having gluttonised that wide-eyed Seetha he is now reposing comfortably. I will eliminate him
with deadly arrows, whose arrowheads blaze away and which shoot off straightly..." Thus Rama
declared. 
On saying thus and on readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his
bow, that ireful Rama rushed towards the eagle, as though to a-tremble the whole of the earth that
which is within the perimeter of oceans. 
But that bird spewing up frothy blood pathetically appealed to such an ireful son of
Dasharatha, namely Rama, in a pathetic tone. 
"Oh, boy Rama, blest is your eternality, for whom you are searching as with the
search of a rejuvenescent herb in the vast of forest, Ravana stole that lady and my lives, too...

"I have seen that lady while being stolen by brute-forced Ravana when you and even
Lakshmana absented from her... 
"I outreached to rescue Seetha... and in a combat Ravana is rendered as one with
utterly battered chariot... and I felled him and that chariot there... onto earth's surface...

"This one is his fragmented bow and this is his fragmented armour... oh, Rama, this
is his combat-chariot... which, in combat shattered by me... 
"This is his charioteer drop dead onto earth by my wings... when I am overtired
Ravana gashed my wings and flew skyward taking Seetha of Videha kingdom with him, and it will be
inapt of you to kill me who am already killed by the demon..." Thus Jataayu appealed to Rama.

Rama jettisoned his forceful bow when he heard the much desired news about Seetha
while hugging that kingly eagle Jataayu. 
Even though Rama is comparatively a bold person he involuntarily fell down to
ground, as the onefold scorch of anguish for Seetha is doubled by this predicament of Jataayu, and
he wept over Jataayu. 
Jataayu is supine on a single-strait passable for a single-person and he is
suspiring for several times, and on seeing such Jataayu Rama became anguished and spoke this to
Soumitri. 
"Mislaid is my kingdom and I am mislocated into forests, Seetha is misplaced and now
this mischance of death on this bird... this kind of misfortune of mine incinerates even Agni, the
Divine-Incinerator... 
"Even if it were to be a plethoric and limitless ocean, and now if I were to enter
it, or take a swim to the other shore of blissfulness, even that Lord of Rivers runs completely
dry, owing to my misfortune, it is definite... 
"There will not be any greater unfortunate being in this world than me, even if all
the sessile and mobile beings are put together, by whom such a complicated catastrophic enmeshment
as this is derived... 
"This decrepit kingly eagle is the friend of my father who is terminally gashed and
recumbent on the floor owing only to the backlash of my fortune..." So lamented Rama for the
wounded eagle Jataayu. 
Thus, lamenting in that way for many times Raghava patted the body of Jataayu along
with Lakshmana instancing his parental regard. 
On hugging that kingly eagle whose wings are hacked off and who is bloodstained, and
on uttering this much, "she who is identical with my lives,... where is that Maithili..." Rama
collapsed to earth. Thereafter, the illustrious Rama, highly respected among his fraternity, (as
follows) to Bharata who was speaking as aforesaid among his relatives.
"These words, which you have spoken are worthy of you, the son of Dasaratha the
excellent king, born through Kaikeyi."
"O, My brother! Long ago, when our father married your mother, he promised your
maternal grandfather that he would confer his kingdom as an exceptional marriage-dowry"
"Thereafter, in a conflict between Gods and demons, your mother received the promise of two boons from the efficient lord of the earth, King Dasartha, as a token of his joy and gratitude."
"O, Tiger among men! Your illustrious mother of beautiful complexion consequently
demanded these two boons from that cheif of men, for you the throne and for me the exile to the forest."
"O, excellent among men! I too, have been enjoined by our aforesaid father to live here in the forest for fourteen years, in accord iwth granting of boon."
"I as such, without any rival, have come to this lonely forest accompanied by
Lakshmana and Seetha in order to carry out the promise given by our father."
"You too ought, likewise, to make our father, as a person having given a true
promise, O Indra (the Lord of Celestials) among kings, by getting yourself anointed to the crown without any delay.
"O, Bharata! For my sake relieve the mighty king from his vow and make both our
mother and fahter happy."
"My dear brother! Formerly, an illustrious king named Gaya, while perfoming a
sacrifice in a place called Gaya in honour of his ancestors, chanted the following verse:
"Since a son delivers his father from a place of torment (hell) called 'Put', he is named as 'Putra'- 'he who delivers his ancestors from all dangers'"
"To have many virtuous and learned sons is to be desired, since one, atleast among them, who is intimately connected will ocme to Gaya to perform a sacrifice."
"O, prince! This is the conviction of all the royal sages. O, the efficient and the excellent of men! Therefore, save our father from hell.
"O, the valiant Bharata! Go to Ayodhya along with Shatrughna and all the Brahmanas and give joy to the people there."
"O, King! I too, without delay, will proceed to Dandaka forest along with Seetha and Lakshaman."
"O, Bharata! You become the Lord of men. I will become the emperor of the wild
beasts of the forest! Return now to the excellent city of Ayodhya full of joy and I also full of joy will enter Dankada Forest!"
"O, Bharata! Let the (royal) white umbrella provide a cool shadow for your head,
repulsing the rays of sunlight. I will take shelter comoftably under the abundant shadow of these forest-trees."
"O, Bharata! The wise Shatrughna is helpful to you. Lakshmana is known to be an
outstanding friend for me. We, the four excellent sons, will ultimately make the king true to his promise. Do not get disappointed."Afterwards ,the self composed Rama by controlling his thoughts with courage ,approached the kind -hearted and affectionate brother Lakshmana who was distressed with agony who was very much angry like a hissing king cobra ,with his eyes dilated with wrath and spoke the following words.
" Hold back grief and anger. Forget this insult, by taking refuge in courage alone. Obtain great joy! Abandon all these arrangements made today for my coronation and immediately take up action that is faultless ."
"Oh, Lakshmana! Show the same zeal now in terminating my coronation as the zeal shown earlier in preparations for my coronation."
"My mother Kaikeyi is still agonized about my coronation. Behave in such a way that no apprehension comes to her mind on this matter."
"Oh, Lakshmana! I do not wish to disregard the painful doubt in her mind even for a moment".
"I do not remember to have done even a small disagreeable thing here at any time to my mothers or to my father, either intentionally or unintentionally."
"Let the promise made by my father ,who is truthful, who is truly mighty and who is afraid of the fear of the other world, become true .Let him be fearless."
"Our father will feel anguished that his word has not come true ,if this coronation is not withdrawn. His distress will cause pain to me."
"Oh, Lakshmana for that reason, I wish to go to forest immediately from her, by withdrawing, coronation arrangement."
"Soon after my departure to the forest now, Kaikeyi having accomplished her purpose, will coolly get her son coronated."
"If go to forest , wearing deer -skin rags and with my hair twisted together Kaikeyi will have mental peace."
"I do not want to create trouble to my father, who has taken this hard decision in his mind . Hence, I will go to the forest at once 
"Oh, Lakshmana! Look at it as destiny which has taken back kingdom given to me and which is sending me to exile"
-"If not making of destiny to create such a thought in Kaikeyi, how come she resolved to harass?"
"You know that I had no discrimination among mothers and Kaikeyi also in the past had no discrimination between me and her son Bharata"
"I do not perceive any other reason than an accident that made Kaikeyi to abolish my coronation , to send me to exile ,and to speak ferocious words ,not to be talked about."
"If it is for not an accidental reason, how Kaikeyi who is of a perfect temperament and who is born in a royal family can tell like a common woman to her husband to create trouble for me ?"
"The influence of destiny is un imaginable. No living being can counteract its influence. An adverse fate has befallen on me and on her .It is clear now ."
"Oh, Lakshmana! There is no means whatsoever to abstain from it otherwise than to follow the course of destiny. Who will be able to fight against the destiny. ?"
"Pleasure and pain, fear and anger, gain and loss, birth and death and such other things are all the acts of destiny"
"Even sages, who performed sever penance, having been harassed by destiny leave aside restraint and get ruined by lust and anger."
"It is indeed an act of destiny which suddenly and unimaginably obstructs an action, undertaken in the world ,at the starting point itself."
"Although my coronation is obstructed, I have no grief since I have restrained the self by myself with real consciousness."
"Hence ,you also ,like me, get the arrangements for coronation withdrawn immediately without any anguish"
Oh, Lakshmana! Let all these very pots of water arranged for coronation be used by me for my bath after completing the religious vow of asceticism."
"Otherwise ,why to me this water in these pots ,which is royal property? The water drawn out by myself ,will be used for my bath after completing the religious vow."
"Oh, Lakshmana! Do not repent about this perverseness of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. When you talk of kingdom or dwelling in the forest, this is the final beautitude."
"Oh, Lakshmana! Do not suspect our mother for obstruction of coronation ceremony. She is uttering evil words, being overpowered by destiny. You are aware of this destiny, which has such influence."Rama, the foremost of those affording happiness to others, reached the aforesaid
tree, worshipped the western twilight and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:
"This might which has got past us today outside the inhabited territory is the first night which has passed without Sumantra. You ought not repent over it."
"Remaining free from lassitude, we must both keep awake during nights, from today
Lakshmana! The safety and welfare of Sita indeed depend on us two."
"Let us pass this night anyhow, Lakshmana! Let us lie down on the ground, covering it by straw, leaves and so on, procured by our own hands."
Streching himself on the bare ground, Rama, who was accustomed to a luxurious coach, uttered the following suitable words to Lakshmana:
"Assuredly the emperor is sleeping badly tonight, while Kaikeyi, having realized her ambitions, ought to feel satisfied."
"Seeing Bharata returned, queen Kaikeyi, I am afraid, may not expel the lives of the emperor for the sake of kingdom."
"Aged and (therefore) helpless, deprived of my presence, what will he do, dominated as he is by his passion for Kaikeyi and who has fallen into the clutches of Kaikeyi."
"Reflecting on this misfortune of the king and his mental derangement, I deem that passion alone is greater than early gain and religious merit."
"what man however deluded, what father on account of a woman, at his own will and
pleasure, abandon a son like myself?
"Alas, Kaikeyi's son Bharata (alone) is happy along with his wife. Like an overlord, he is going to enjoy the prosperous kingdom of Kosala."
"Father is superannuated. I am staying in the forest. Bharata will become the prime head for the entire kingdom."
"He who pursues sensuous pleasures neglecting his real interests and discipline soon comes to distress; in the same way as king Dasaratha has."
"It seems that Kaikeyi came into our house, oh good brother, to bring about an end to Dasaratha, to send me into exile and to secure kingship for Bharata."
"Blinded by pride of good fortune, Kaikeyi may even now persecute Kausalya and
Sumitra because of their relationship with me."
"Queen Sumitra is likely to suffer hardship because of her affinity to us. From this very place, you proceed to Ayodhya next morning, oh, Lakshmana!"
"I shall proceed to Dandaka forest alone with Sita, while you will be the protector for Kausalya, who has no defender."
"Kaikeyi of base deeds may resort to unjustified means to be disliked. Give (for
protection) my mother to Bharata, oh virtuous Prince!"
"In some other (past) birth, women must have been deprived of their sons by my
mother (Kausalya), oh, Lakshmana! For that reason this has arisen certainly."
"At a time when Kausalya should have obtained benefits for her labors repaid by me, she has been deprived of my company by me, who was nurtured by her for a long time and brought up with great pains. Woe to me."
"Let no woman ever give birth to such a son as myself, who have caused perpetual
grief to my mother, oh, Lakshmana!"
"Oh, Lakshmana! I think that myna (which is kept as a pet by mother Kausalya) is
more affectionate than I, since her are heard the words, "Bite, oh parrot, the foot of the enemy."
"What can be done by me, her son, who cannot go to her aid even a little to her, my mother, who is weeping, who is unfortunate and who has no son, oh conqueror of foes?"
"Kausalya my mother of poor luck indeed, bereft of me, is stricken with great
melancholy and lies plunged in a sea of grief"
"Enraged, I can subdue with my arrows single handed not only Ayodhya but also the
earth. But it is not a question of valor here."
"Oh, the sinless Lakshmana! I am terribly concerned of doing wrong and of ruining my prospects in the other world. Hence, I do not allow myself to be crowned."
Rama during the night in that lonely forest, wailed piteously thus and in so many
other ways and sat quite, his face full of tears.
Lakshmana consoled Rama as follows when the later had ceased lamenting like a fire whose flames had gone out and as a sea without a violent motion.
"The city of Ayodhya, now that you have come away from it, has certainly been
divested of its splendor and resembles a night without the moon, Oh, Rama the jewel among armed warriors!"
"It is not proper, oh Rama, that you should grieve in this way. You cause distress to Sita and me too, oh jewel among men!"
"Oh, Rama! Bereft of you , neither Sita nor I will not survive even for a moment,
like fish pulled out of water."
"Oh, Rama causing pain to the foes! Without you, I do not wish to see either our
father or Satrughna or Sumitra or even the heaven."
Then Rama and Lakshmana the lovers of piety, sitting comfortably there and on seeing a bed well- prepared under a banyan tree, sought for the bed.
Attentively hearing Lakshmana's words which were excellent and wholistic and
adopting for a fairly long period the course of conduct prescribed for hermits, Rama resolved to spend all the fourteen years in exile with Lakshmana.
Thence forward, those two powerful offspring of the Raghu race (Rama and Lakshmana) never admitted fear or agitation (while dwelling) in that vast and lonely forest any more than a couple of lions on the slopes of a mountain.Thinking of difficulties one will be called upon to bear in the forest, Rama who was fond of righteousness did not form the idea of taking Sita who was speaking as aforesaid.
Soothening with kind words to Sita, when eyes were blemished with tears, the
virtuous Rama spoke again as follows, for the purpose of waking her turn back.
"Sita! Your are born in a high lineage, ever devoted to righteousness. Perform your own virtue here, which is agreable to my mind."
"Oh Sita, the delicate! Do whatever I tell you. There are many inconveniencs in the forest. Know them from me."
"Oh, Sita! Let your thought made about forest be given up. It is indeed said that
forest with its wilderness is fraught with many dangers."
This advice is given by me, keeping your welfare in view. I do not ever consider a forest as comfortable. It is always uncomfortable."
"The sounds created from waterfalls in hills and from lions resding in mountain
caves are unpleasant to hear. That is why living in a forest in uncomfortable."
"Large wild animals which are fearless and intoxicated sporting in the desolate
forest; come forward, after seeing. Oh, Sita! That is why living in forest is uncomfortable."
"Even streams filled with crocodiles full of mire are difficult to be crossed by rut elephants also. Hence dwelling in a forest is always very much uncomfortable.
"Pathways covered with creepers and thorns, echoed with noise of wild cocks, are
water-less and very difficult to enter. Hence dwelling in a forest is hardship."
"One distress by fatigue has to sleep in nights on a bed of fallen leaves. Hence,
living in a forest is very much a misery."
"Oh, Sita! With mind disciplined day and night, one has to necessarily satisfy
ourself with fruits fallen from trees. Hence, living in a forest is a suffering."
"Oh, Sita the princess of Mithila! Fasting is to be done according to one's stamina. Clothes of bark are to be worn and mass of matted hair has to be worn on the head."
"The celestials, the ancestors, the guests who arrive are to be worshipped always
according to the preseribed rites."
"Bath is to be performed three times a day at appropriate time by the one moving in the forest, with one's mind kept in restraint. Hence, living in a forest is very much a misery."
"Oh, Sita the innocent! Offering is to be done with flowers brought by one's own
self at the altar, according to the rites prescribed by sages. Hence, living in a forest is a hardship."
"Oh, Sita the princess of Mithila! The dwellers of forest are to be satisfied with whatever is obtained there, the restricted food. Hence, living in forest is a misery.
"In the forest, air and darkness are too much. There are always hunger and great
fears too. Hence, dwelling in a forest is very much a misery."
"Oh, Sita! Various creeping animals of different forms roam about on earth with
pride. Hence dwelling in a forst is a great misery."
"Snakes dwelling in rivers, moving crookedly like rivers, stay obstucting the
pathways. Hence, living in forest is a great misery."
"Oh, frail princess! Flying insects, scropious, insects including mosquitoes and
files always annoy every one. Hence, forest is full of hardship."
"Oh, Sita! Forest is full of trees, kusa grass and bambooes with ends of their
branches spread on all sides. Hence, living in a forest is a great misery."
"An inhabitant living in a forest has to face various bodily troubles and panics.
Hence, forest- life is readly a misery."
"Anger and greed are to be abandoned by the dwellers of forest. Devotion is to be
bestowed on asceticism. What needs to be feared, should not be feared. Hence, living in a forest is a suffereing."
"Therefore, do away with the idea of your coming to the forest. Forest is not indeed bearable for you. Reflecting now, I perceive forest as having too many disadvantages."
As the great souled Rama did not agree to take her to the forest, the much aggrieved Sita spoke to Rama as follows:-Rama the glorious man, who was with his joyful friends, ascended the chariot and saw the city which was decorated with flags and banners, which was perfumed all around by burning excellent aloe wood and which was endowed with varied types of people.
That Rama went through the royal passage which was incensed with aloe wood. That royal street was splendid with white houses resembling clouds.
Rama entered that excellent royal route, which was filled with sandal, superior aloe-wood, excellent perfumes, silk and linen cloth, heaps of them, unpierced pearls, excellent things made of crystal, splendid with various kinds of flowers and eatables and which was not congested.
Rama saw that royal route like divine passage in heaven. All the road junctions there were regularly worshipped with yoghurt, unbroken rice, clarified butter, fried grain, incense, aloe and sandal and all types of garlands and perfumes.
Hearing the various blessing words spoken by his friends, he went acknowledging all those people suitably.
"Get coronated today, take the path followed by your grandfathers and great grandfathers and rule the kingdom."
"If Rama becomes king, we shall be more happy than when his father ruled and also when his grandfathers ruled.
"If we can see Rama going forth in the city after getting coronated today, it is enough of eating or other activities."
"There is no other dearer thing to us than coronation of Rama of unbounded splendour".
Rama, though hearing of these good, words spoken by his friends about himself was passive and went in royal route.
Though Rama became distant, no one could turn back one's eyes and mind from him, the best of men.
All the people blamed the one who did not see Rama and the one who was not seen by Rama. 
Such a person would blame himself of it.
Rama, the virtuous, had compassion towards all the four classes of men and towards the aged people. Hence, they were all devoted to him.
Rama went by crossing road junction, god's paths, sacred trees and temples keeping his right side towards them.
Rama approached the royal abode and entered his father's palace which was the best palace with blazing radiance like the palace of king of celestials on earth. All around the house, there were various types turrets looking like Mount Kailasa, as group of clouds, as white heavenly cars touching the sky. There were royal houses named vardhamana which were adorned with a net of precious stones.
Rama the best of men crossed with chariot three enclosures protected by men armed with bows and moved over the other two enclosures by foot.
That Rama passed over all the gates, sent all the people back and entered the palace.
When Rama went nearer to his father, all the people there were delighted waiting for his return as the ocean waits for raising of the moon.The lives of those citizens, who had returned dejected and cheerless in this way
after accompanying Rama were greatly hurt, having their eyes filled with tears afflicted with grief, longing to give up their lives and appeared as though they were dead.
Reaching each his own house, all of them surrounded by their sons and wife, shed
tears, their faces being covered by them.
None was either delightful or merry. Merchants no longer exhibited their wares, nor their merchandise looked charming. Those in charge of home did not attend to cooking.
None was delightful for instance on finding out a lost fortune, or on getting riches in abundance. No mother did rejoice even on obtaining a son born for the first time.
Oppressed with sorrow and weeping, women in every house heaped reproaches on their husbands who came home, with words as sharp as pricks of the goad which attack an elephant.
"What purpose of theirs who do not see Rama, will be served by their dwellings, wife or wealth or sons or pleasures even?"
Lakshmana alone is a good man in this world, who was accompanying Rama belonging to Kakutstha dynasty, along with Sita ,duly rendering service to them in the forest."
"Fortunate too are the rivers; lotus ponds and lakes for bathing in whose sacred
waters Rama entered into."
"Forests with beautiful row of trees, tracks of land abounding in water, rivers and mountains with alluring peaks will bring splendor to Rama."
"Any mountain or forest which Rama will visit, will not fail to respect him like a beloved guest who has arrived."
"Plants with many -colored flowers as their chaplets, bearing copious clusters of
blossoms full of bees exhibit themselves at Rama."
"Even in unseasonable ness, mountains in compassion will present principal flowers and fruits to Rama, on his arrival."
"Mountains will show various wonderful waterfalls again and again, duly streaming
forth uncontaminated waters."
"Trees on apex of mountains will enrapture Rama. Where there is Rama, there is
neither fear nor humiliation".
"That Rama the son of Dasaratha, the hero and the mighty armed will come to our view not far from us. Let us run after him."
"The shelter of the feet of the lord and the high-souled Rama is in itself a joy.
Rama indeed is the protector of all of us, he the refuge and our supreme asylum "
"We shall serve Sita; while you attend on Rama." Thus, the citizen's wives,
afflicted with agony, spoke in so many words to their husbands.
"Rama will secure the needs and interests of yours in the forest, while Sita will do the same thing with regard to us womenfolk."
"Who will be highly pleased with this residence in the city, which is apprehensible, with anxious people in it and not being a pleasant spot with unsettled minds?"
"If it were to be the rule of Kaikeyi, it will not be in consonance with
righteousness, with no protector and indeed with no use for our lives, mush less for our sons and riches."
"Whom else Kaikeyi will not abandon? --that Kaikeyi, by whom her son and her husband were forsaken for the sake of power and who brought disgrace to her family."
"We swear even by our sons that while Kaikeyi is surviving and as long as we live, we will never inhabit this kingdom as Kaikeyi's servants!"
"Who can live happily on having obtained (as one's ruler) that impious woman of
wicked conduct, who banished the son of the king without any pity?"
"The whole of this kingdom, without any leader, having no support and visited by
calamities, will meet with ruin because of Kaikeyi's fault."
"For, Rama having gone into exile, the monarch will not survive and when Dasaratha is dead, utter regrets will remain thereafter. It is certain!"
"So, drink poison duly stirred up, since your merits are exhausted and you are
marked out by ill fortune. Otherwise, follow Rama to forest or reach a place where even the name of Kaikeyi may not reach your ears."
"Rama has been sent to exile along with Sita and Lakshmana deceitfully. We have been handed over now to Bharata, like the beasts in the hands of a slaughterer."
"Rama, whose face is like the full moon, of dark brown complexion, whose collar-bone is invisible (because of its being covered with flesh), a conqueror of foes, whose arms descend to his knees, whose eyes resemble lotuses, the elder brother of Lakshmana, who takes initiative in speaking and expresses with sweetness, truthful of speech and possessed of extra ordinary strength, is benevolent to all, delightfully charming as the moon, that tiger among men, as mighty as an
elephant in rut, that great car-warrior, will surely adorn the woods, while roaming through them.."
Those wives of citizens in the city of Ayodhya, lamenting as aforesaid, began
weeping, as though fear has cropped up for a forth-coming death.
The sun sank below the horizon and the night fell, while the women in the houses
were weeping in that manner about Rama.
The city of Ayodhya, in which the kindling of fires had ceased and the chanting of Vedas and narration of sacred stories died out, looked as though it was coated with darkness at that time.
The city of Ayodhya, in which the business of the trading class had come to a
stand-still, in which joy had been faded out, which had become (now) support less, looked dim as though stars had disappeared in the sky.
The women whose minds became sick on account of Rama, as one would feel on one's own son or brother having been sent into exile, cried miserably expressing their grief in various ways.
To them, Rama was dearer than their very sons!
That city of Ayodhya, in which singing, rejoicing, dancing and instrumental music
had been completely set at rest, when jpy had departed forever and whose shops had been closed, looked at that time like a grat ocean whose waters had dried up.Then, Rama Seetha and Lakshmana, who felt miserable, bowed down by touching the feet of the king and went round him clockwise with joined palms.
After taking leave of Dasaratha, Rama who knew what is right and stood confounded by sorrow, bowed along with Seetha to Kausalya.
Immediately following his brother, Lakshmana too bowed to Kausalya, then clasped the feet of his mother Sumitra.
Smelling (as a token of affection) the head of Lakshmana mighty armed, who was
saluting her, his mother Sumitra who wished well of him, spoke weepin, to that son of her ( as follows)
"Highly fond of your kinsman Rama, you have been pemitted (by me) to dwell in the
forest(with your eldest half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother Rama, who is going to the forest, my son!"
"Oh, sinless one! Whether in adversity or in riches, he alone is refugee to you. It should become the code of conduct in the world, that younger brother should be subject to the control of his elder brother."
"It is indeed a practice right from ancient times in your race, to make gifts, to
dedicate onself to performance of sacrificial rites and to foresake one's body to fight battles."
Thus speaking to Lakshmana, who was in readiness to leave the forest and who loved Rama dearly, Sumitra repeatedly said to him, "fare forth, fare forth!"
"Know Rama to be Dasaratha. Look upon Seetha the daughter of Janaka as myself.
Consider the forest as Ayodhya and depart happily, my son!"
Then, Sumantra the humble man, who was aware of humility, joined his palms and spoke these words to Rama even as Matali(charioteer of Indra) would to Indra (the ruler of gods).
"Mount the chariot, oh the highly illustrious prince! May all be well with you! I
shall take you speedily, wherever you direct me to go."
"you have to reside in the forest for fourteen years. Those years, as directed by
the queen, are to be considered having commenced."
Having adorned herself, Seetha with her comely buttocks, mounted with a delighted
mind, that chariot which was shining like the sun.
Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers quickly mounted that chariot, which was replendent like fire and decked with gold.
For Seetha who was accompanying with her husband, Dasaratha gave away garments and jewellery, taking into consideration the period for which she had to stay in the forest.
Even so for the two brothers, keeping the sets of weapon, an armour of hard make
with leather-cover in the midst of the chariot, Sumantra saw the three of whom Seetha constituted the third mounted and quickly drove the horses which were highly admired, with their swiftness resembling the velocity of wind.
Rama after departing to the great forest for a long term, unconsciousness prevailed in the city. There was faintness in the strength of people.
The city( of Ayodhya) is filled with flurry, with its elephants intoxicated in rut and highly excited and resonant with tinkling of ornaments of horses.
That city, including the youngsters and the old, stricken with extreme agony, ran
towards Rama alone, in the same way as the one afflicted with heat of the sun rushes towards water.
Having down towards sides and back of the chariot with their faces turned towards
Rama and with their faces filled with tears, all those people said with loud voices to Sumantra thus:
"Hold in the reins of the horses and go slowly and slowly, Oh charioteer! We would behold the face of Rama, which would be henceforth difficult to behold for us"
"The heart of Rama's mother(Kausalya) is surely and undoubtedly made of iron, since it does not get broken when Rama resembling an offspring of gods is going to the forest"
"Seetha(the princess of Videha kingdom) has done what ought to be done, by going
along with him like a shadow, delighted in virtue as she was and does not leave her husband in the same way as Mount Meru does not leave the efflugence of sun"
"Oh, Lakshmana! You are attending ever to your brother who speaks affectionately and is equal to the god. Ah, you are the accomplisher of purpose!"
"It is an immense fulfilment for you, it is a tremendous good fortune for you, nay, it is even a means to heaven that you are following this Rama"
Saying so, those people were not able to restrain their tears that come and followed that Rama, their beloved delight of the Ikshvakus.
Then, the king with the distressed mind, saying that he would behold his beloved
saw, came out of his palace surrounded by women who were too dejected.
In front of him was heard a huge noise of crying women, echoing like trumpeting of female elephants when a lordly elephant has been pinioned.
At that time, the father of Rama as is well known as a glorious king Dasaratha(a
scion of Kakutstha) looked shrunk, like the full moon oversadowed by an eclipse.
That glorious son of Dasaratha(Rama) of inconceivable courage, directed the
charioteer in the words "Let the chariot be driven fast."
Rama commanded that charioteer with the words "Move on!" The people said to him
"stop!" Urged on the passage, the charioteer could not do both.
The dust raised on the road due to moving out of mighty armed Rama, was suppressed by the falling tears of the citizens.
With full of wailing tears, the citizens of after making loud cries became
unconscious with deep agony, at the time of departure of Rama.
Tears born of anguish flowed from the eyes of women like(drops of) water falling
from lotuses by the commotion of fish.
Seeing the city with singleness of mind, the glorious monarch Dasaratha fell down
with agony, like a tree slain at its root.
Thereafter, seeing the king becoming feeble and much distressed, the outery of the people rose from the rear of Rama.
Some poeple crying "Oh, Rama!" and some other scrying "Oh, Rama's mother!", made the entire women in the gynaecium to weap.
Looking back, Rama saw the king sorrowful and perplexed in mind, as well as his
mother following (him) on the road.
Rama, bound by the chord of righteousness, could not gaze openly at his parents, as a foal caught in asnare would not properly look at its dam.
Seeing them coming by foot, though worthy of a chariot, habituated to comfort and
unworthy of suffering, Rama commanded the charioteer with words: "Drive fast!"
Rama the tiger among men, feeling pained, as an elephant being pricked by a good,
indeed was not able to bear that plight of his father and his mother.
Rama's mother (Kausalya) ran towards her son, as a cow fond of her calf and whose
calf is tied(in a stall), runs home for her calf.
Rama again and again saw that Kausalya, his mother who was crying thus, running
after that chariot as though dancing, shouting"Oh, Rama, Rama!" "Oh, Seetha!" and "Oh, Lakshmana!"
trickling tears descending from her eyes for the sake of Rama Lakshmana and Seetha.
Dasaratha exclaimed saying "Stop!" while Rama called out "Go on, proceed!" (In that way) Sumantra's mind became confused, as in between two (opposing) whirl pools.
Rama said to him: "You can say to the king that you did not hear (his call), even
when scolded (later). seeing their grief for a long time is quite unbearbale."
The charioteer, doing as per Rama's words, took leave of those citizens and drive
the horses more speedily even while they are going.
The king's people returned after (mentally) going round Rama. Their minds did not
return. Their impulse of tears also did not get reduced.
The ministers spoke to king Dasaratha as follows:" We should not follow to a long
distance him whom we wish to see come back."
Hearing their words, which were befilting with all virtues, the king Dasaratha felt miserable, stopped short, gazing along with his wife, at his son Rama, with his whole body perspiring and wearing a dejected look.Thus, Vali who is hit down by an arrow and who is collapsing humbly speaks exacting words that contain 
probity, meaningfulness, and experience, to Rama. 
Then to him who is rendered like a lusterless sun, fizzling out like a cloud that released its water, 
and who became like a quenched fire, to such a best monkey and an unexcelled lord of monkeys who has 
just now imputed Rama with words that abounding with righteousness and meaningfulness, Rama spoke 
subsequently. 
"Uncaring for probity, prosperity, pleasure deriving, and even for the social conventions, now how do 
you rebuke me childishly in this matter? 
"Unconsulted are the doyens of your race that are intellectually well off and agreeable to your mentors 
about rights and wrongs about your deeds, oh, gentle one, how do you wish to debate with me in this 
matter with your primate's caprice? 
"This earth with its mountains, woods, and forests, even along with the authority to condone or condemn 
the animals, birds, and humans on it belong to Ikshvaku-s. 
"He who is virtue-souled, truth-abiding, plain-speaking, and the knower of the import of probity, pleasures, 
and prosperity, and the one who is concerned in controlling or condoning his subjects, that Bharata 
is the ruler of the earth. 
"In whom both scrupulousness and benignancy are there, truthfulness is firmed up, and valour, as evinced 
by scriptures, is evident, and he who is the knower of time and place is the king, namely Bharata. 
"Holding his virtuous decree desiring to keep up the continuum of righteousness, we and some other kings 
are wayfaring this earth in its entirety. 
"While that Bharata, the kingly tiger and a patron of virtue, is ruling the earth in its entirety, who 
is there to conduct himself in an unacceptable way to morality on it?
"Abiding in our pre-eminent righteousness, and even abiding by the order of Bharata we punish him 
who deviated from the path of morality, according to custom.
"As for you, you brought virtue to a state of decadence, rendered yourself reprovable by your decadent 
behaviour, for carnality alone, has become your primary doctrine, and thus you have not abided by the 
conduct meetly to a king. 
"It is to be known by him who treads the way of righteousness that he has three fatherly personages, 
namely his father, his elder brother, and the one who accords education to him. 
"A younger brother, a son, and a disciple with good characteristics, these three are to be deemed as 
one's sons, for such matters, take base on rectitude alone. 
"The probity practised by principled people is very subtle and highly imponderable, and the soul that 
abides in the hearts of all beings alone can differentiate between just and unjust. 
"Like a blind by birth counselling with similarly blind, you being vacillant, on your counselling 
only with frantic-minded vacillant monkeys, what can you fathom about right and wrong? 
"I will clarify the words I have said, but I tell you that it is indeed inapt of you to disdain 
me just out of your outrage. 
"Realise this reason by which I have eliminated you... you misbehaved with your brother's wife, forsaking 
the perpetual tradition. 
"While the great-souled Sugreeva is still alive, you with your habit of sinful acts have lustily misbehaved 
with Sugreeva's wife Ruma, who should be counted as your daughter-in-law. 
"Thereby, oh, vanara, this punishment is imposed on you, for your dissolute sinning in abusing your 
brother's wife, thereby for your transgression of tradition and virtue. 
"I foresee no other kind of control other than punishment to him who conducts himself contrary to the 
society and who is deviant of conventions. 
"As a Kshatriya emerged from a best dynasty I do not tolerate your wrongdoing, and the punishment to 
the one who lustfully indulges with his daughter, or with his sister, or with the wife of his younger 
brother is his elimination, as recalled from the scriptures. 
While Bharata is the lord of the land and we are his proxies adhering to his orders, and while you too have 
overstepped the bounds of rightness, then how is it possible to be lenient? 
"While ruling righteously sensible Bharata punishes him who oversteps the momentous virtue, and he is 
poised to put down lustful ones. 
"As for us, oh, monkey's lord, we effectuate our brother's orders and our duty, and we stand for curbing 
your kind of shatterers of ethics.
"My association with Sugreeva is as good as that with Lakshmana, nevertheless it betided with an understanding 
to regain Sugreeva's wife and kingdom, and he will give succour to me. 
"I gave a promise to Sugreeva at the time of befriending him in the presence of vanara-s, and how is 
Is it possible for my kind to dishonour a given promise? 
"Thereby you have to infer that a befitting punishment is given to you, owing to all these great reasons 
that abound with virtue and with supreme value.
"Anywise, you have to regard the punishment given to you as legitimate, and he whom rectitude guides 
have to help his friend, in any event. 
"Had you pursued rightness you too would have done the same deed in imposing such a punishment, and 
we hear two verses that are given to the advocacy of good conventions, which the experts of rightness 
have also accepted, and which are said to be coined by Manu, and I too conducted myself only as detailed 
in those verses of law. 
" 'When kings impose proper punishment on the humans who have sinned, they become sinless and enter 
heaven as with the pious souls with good deeds.' So says one verse of Manu. 
" 'Either by punishment or by clemency a thief will be absolved from sin, but the king who does not 
impose proper punishment will derive the blot of that sin.' So says the other verse of Manu.
"When a renouncer has sinned against that of the one committed by you, my venerable ancestor Maandhaata 
has given punishment which he desired. 
"Such sin is acquired even by other kings who are unobservant in imposing proper punishment, and those 
kings had to make amends for it at the appropriate time, by that propitiation they used to mitigate that 
the filth of that sin. 
"Thereby, enough with your annoyance, oh, tigerly vanara, as your elimination is devised righteously, 
and we too are not independent.
"Oh, brave and best one among monkeys, further listen to another cause, and on listening to that important 
cause you will not be infuriated. 
"I have neither angst nor ire in this matter of my eliminating you, or, your reviling me, oh, best monkey, 
but listen to the other point I wish to make clear. People will be capturing several animals, either 
covertly or overtly, with snares, springs and even numerous contrivances. 
"Meat-eating people will undeniably kill animals, whether they are speedily sprinting or standing steadily, 
fully dismayed or undismayed, vigilant or unvigilant, and even if they are facing away, in that there 
is no sacrilege. 
"In this world, even the kingly sages well-versed in virtue will go on hunting, and hunting is no face-to-face game, as such, oh, vanara, therefore I felled you in combat with my arrow because you are a tree-branch animal, whether you are not combating with me or combating against me. 
"Kings are the bounteous benefactors of the unobtainable righteousness and propitious lifestyles, oh, 
best vanilla, no doubt about it. 
"They the kings are not to be harmed, also not to be reproved, not disparaged and nothing displeasing 
is spoken to them, as they are the divinities conducting themselves in human form on the plane of Earth. 

"I am abiding by the ethicalness practised by my father and forefathers, but you revile me without the 
knowledge of rightness, just by clinging to your rancour." Thus said Rama to dying Vali. 
Vali is much distressed at the heart of the heart when Rama says categorically in that way, whereby, deriving 
certitude about rightness he found no incorrectness with Rama.
That lord of vanara-s then replied Rama with adjoined palms, "Oh, best one among men, what all you have 
said is that way proper, undoubtedly. 
"Indeed an ignoble cannot disprove a nobleman, Raghava, and with regards to the undesirable and improper 
words I have unwittingly spoken earlier, in that matter too it will be truly unapt of you to make me 
blameworthy, as I spoke them in anguish and ignorance. 
"You alone are the knower of recourses and their real nature, namely probity, prosperity, pleasure-seeking, 
and emancipation; dharma, artha, kama, moksha; and you take delight 
in the welfare of subjects, and your faultless intellect is clear in accomplishing ends by judging the 
causes and effects. 
"Oh, Rama, the knower of probity, I am the one who digressed from the rightness and a forerunner among 
such transgressors, such as I am, give absolution even to me with words abounded with rightness." Vali 
is thus saying to Rama. 
Vali who was like an elephant plumped in slough continued to say slowly, with tears fully impeding his throat 
and with an agonised moan, on keenly observing Rama. 
"Also, I neither worry for myself, nor Tara, nor even for any relatives of mine, as I do for my 
son Angada, the best-virtuous one with golden bicep-lets. 
"Right from his childhood I fondly looked after Angada, and he will be dejected when he sees me no more, 
and he withers away like a lake with its water drained for a drink. 
"He is boyish, juvenile, and the only dear son of mine, oh, Rama, as such that great-mighty son of Tara 
needs your protection. 
"You have firm convictions about practicable and impracticable procedures, and you alone are the protector 
of the good and punisher of the bad, hence treating both Sugreeva and Angada with equal compassion. 
"Oh, lord of men, it will be apt of you to show the same kind of outlook towards Sugreeva, oh, king, 
even towards Angada, which you have for Bharata and Lakshmana. 
"The fault occurring from my fault of maltreating Sugreeva may not light upon that self-reproachful 
Tara, it will be apt of you to see that Sugreeva will not look down on her treating her as the wife 
of his rival. 
"When you indeed approve someone, he is capable enough to govern the kingdom, abiding himself under 
your control and following your heart, why a kingdom, he can rule the earth, why earth, he can even 
achieve the heaven itself. 
"Though Tara dissuaded me I met with my brother Sugreeva in a duel as though aspiring elimination at 
your hand.." On saying thus to Rama that vanara, Vali the lord of monkeys' paused for a while.  
Rama consoled Vali with words that are agreeable to savants and that contain the essence and meaning 
of rightness, while Vali had an evincible perspective of righteousness by now. Rama spoke to 
Vali this way. 
"Oh, fly-jumper, you need not be remorseful about your wife, son and others you leave behind, because 
we take care of them... nor you should bother about us thinking that we have arbitrarily eliminated 
you, nor necessarily bother about yourself for committing sins, as we took this decision according to 
rightness and considerateness in your respect. 
"He who administers punishment to the punishable, and he who is punishable and gets punished, both of 
them will achieve the results of cause and effect, where punishment is the effect of the cause of 
wrongdoing and they both thereby will not be condemned. 
"Thereby, by the punishment, you are completely divested of your blemish, and as contained 
in the scriptures on rightness, you attained your true nature, that which is agreeable to rightness. 

"Let distress, desire and even dread that abide in your heart be discarded, oh, monkey's supreme, you 
cannot possibly transcend destiny. 
"As Angada has always been conducting himself with you, thus he will conduct himself with Sugreeva and 
also even with me, without doubt." Thus Rama spoke to Vali. 
On hearing the agreeable and assertive words of that great-souled Rama, who is the treader on the path 
of rightness and an absolute crusher of enemies in war, Vali, the vanara, spoke these well-disposed 
words to Rama. 
"Oh, lord, oh, tremendously braving one, oh, Rama, the lord of people, I blamed you when your arrow 
sweltered and rendered me imbecile, thus I blamed you unthinkingly for which I may please be pardoned, 
I appease you for the same. While fiercely valorous Khara proceeded towards Rama's hermitage, Rama along with his brother Lakshmana 
has indeed seen the very same auguries which have earlier appeared to Khara. 
On looking at those very gruesomely bad omens, and perceiving them to be unpropitious to people, Rama 
spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. 
"Oh, dextrous Lakshmana, for the complete elimination of all the demons these great indications have 
arisen, as though betokening the annihilation of all beings. See them. 
"On their part these clouds are hovering on the sky with stark reddish-grey tint, thunderously braying 
and copiously showering streams of blood. 
"All my arrows too are incensed to fuming in an ecstasy towards a war, and dorsally gold-plated bows 
of mine are incessantly spurring to hook up those arrows, telling apart the impeding conflict. 
"Judging by the kind of wild birds that are shrieking here, danger is up ahead and coming upon us, along 
with uncertainty of our lives. 
"This right hand of mine is indicating by its repeated throbbing that a critical and riotous conflict 
is going to occur, no doubt, but oh brave one, our victory and defeat to the enemies are also in vicinity, 
and for sure, your face is also appearing brightish and aglow, which itself is a good omen.  

"If the faces of those that are poised for a conflict loose lustre, deem that the death is looming large 
on their longevity too. 
"This nasty noise which we hear pertains to the uproar of demons, and even to the drumming of war drums 
by the demons of fiendish activities, and this is ear-splitting. 
"Preventive measures are to be effectuated for any imminent situation by any well-wishing person, or 
by a person with misgivings about a danger, or by a person of talent. 
"Hence, wield your bow, keep arrows ready at hand, and taking Vaidehi with you seek shelter in a impassable 
cave of a mountain overgrown with trees. 
"I wish you to gainsay me for this word of mine, my boy, have honour on my feet and be gone not before 
long. 
"You are a stalwart, a forceful one, and for sure you can eliminate them all, it is doubtless, but I 
long to eliminate all of the nightwalkers, personally" Rama said thus to Lakshmana. 
When Rama said to him that way, Lakshmana picked up his bow and arrows, and together with Seetha he 
took shelter in an unreachable cave. 
On Lakshmana's entering into cave along with Seetha, Rama said to himself, "thank goodness, it is a 
good-idea!" and thus saying he donned his shield. 
Well bedecked in a shield that has fire-like brilliance that Rama shone forth like a fumeless conflagration 
up-shot in utter darkness. 
On raising his imposing bow and drawing arrows, that valorous Rama firmed up and stood there, filling 
all the directions with the tinny sounds of bowstring. 
Gods with gandharva-s and great-souled siddha-s along with carana-s have then met one another and came 
there aspiring to see the war. 
The great-souled sages and those that are known in worlds as eminent Brahma-sages, on their coming together 
those beings of pious exploits spoke to one another, among themselves. 
"Let good betide cows, Brahmans and those people that are abiding in all the worlds. Raghava shall be 
victorious in the war over the clansmen of Sage Paulastya, the nightwalkers." Thus they talked among 
themselves. 
Thus speaking they also well-said again, looking at each other "the demons of fiendish deeds are fourteen 
thousand in number and this virtue-souled Rama is solitary... what would be the result of this war!" 
Thus the sages discussed among themselves. 
Thus the assemblages of kingly-sages, siddha-s and the eminent Brahmans, along with gods that are staying 
in their aircrafts, tarried there in the firmament peering inquisitively at Rama. 
Immured in an aura of invincibility Rama is standing up to the war in its vanguard, and then on seeing 
at him all beings went into the throes of dread. 
That nonesuch aspect of Rama whose deeds are unharmful to any, has become the aspect of wrathful supreme-souled 
Rudra. 
While gods, gandharva-s, carana-s are conversing thus, then they have seen there the legions of the 
demons arriving from all over with boisterous noises, spouting cries of bravo, handling their grisly 
skins, shields, weaponry and war-flags, and onrushing at each other in disarray. With brassy twanging 
of bows, with the drumming of war drums, and even by their jumping, leaping and bouncing that area is 
filled with very loud and clamorous noise. 
When highly brutish cacophony of demons started to fill the forest, that jangling even panicked the 
brutes ranging in that forest, and those beasts dashed off to other places where silence prevailed, 
without looking back. 
And that foolhardy army of demons which in simile is like an unnavigable ocean steered towards Rama 
handling many assault weapons. 
Casting his sight all-over even that war-expert Rama has seen that army of Khara lunging at a conflict. 

Rama stretched his awesome bow to examine the taut of bowstring, and even whipped arrows out of quiver, 
and then adopted a mask of extreme wrath to eliminate all the demons. 
And when he is enraged and blazing he became frightful-looking like the blazing Fire at the end of era, 
and on seeing such a Rama when he is pervaded with conflagration like anger, the pastoral deities are 
very much annoyed. 
The all-pacific aspect of that Rama then in his exasperation appeared to be like that of the all-ruinous 
Rudra, the wielder of bow called Pinaki, namely peaceful Shiva when enraged, at the time of Rudra's 
embarking on to ruin the Vedic ritual of Daksha Prajaapati. 
That army of raw-flesh eaters with their bows, embellishments, and chariots, and also with their armours, 
all glittering with the dazzle of flaming fire, varied into a sky-blue coloured cluster of clouds on 
which the dazzling sunrays will be glittering at the dawning of the sun. There are fourteen thousand demons against one Rama, and the Divine beings watch this from heavens as 
a sport, without according any miraculous powers to Rama, suggesting that a human has to face any number 
of problems, here fourteen thousand demons, for himself and no divine grace suddenly comes to his help.
Rama gives the demons enough time and warning, but as the atrocity is escalating, he uses one gandharva 
missile and many other arrows, which will devastate the entire army of Dushana's brute force.
Khara on arriving at the hermitage along with forerunning soldiers saw the enemy-eliminator and wrathful 
Rama holding fast to his bow. 
On seeing Rama that bawling Khara raised his string-taut bow that makes an ass-like braying twang, drove 
his charioteer crazy saying, "drive to the fore of that Rama..." 
On the orders of Khara the charioteer drove the horses to there where the mighty armed Rama is standing 
single-handedly while swaying his bow. 
On seeing Khara descending on Rama then all those nightwalkers who are the deputies of Khara encircled 
Khara venting out loud battle cries. 
Khara staying on his chariot in the thick of those demons appeared to be like coppery-red planet Mars 
up-shot in the thick of stars. 
In his proneness to war then Khara assaulted that uniquely forceful Rama with a thousand arrows and 
blared a roaring battle cry. 
All of those infuriated nightwalkers then incessantly rained diverse weapons on that invincibleRama 
who is handling a horrific bow. 
Those demons that are already caught up with rancour bombarded Rama with bludgeons, lances, tridents, 
darts and hatchets. 
Those massive bodied and exceptionally mighty demons came jostling like immense clouds in their eagerness 
to kill Rama in that war, while some mounted on chariots and horsebacks, and some more riding mountain-ridges 
like elephants rushed in on Rama. 
And those bands of demons have outpoured arrows on Rama, as with enormous black-clouds disemboguing 
torrents on a lofty mountain. 
When hemmed in with those grisly-looking demons Rama appeared like Rudra surrounded by his divine retinue 
calledprathama gaNa-s, on certain days, whereupon he starts his all-destructive 
cosmic-dance. 
That Raghava has pre-empted those arrows discharged by the demons with his excruciatingly pointed arrows 
as an ocean would do with the river's onrush. 
Even if his body is gashed with those gruesome assault weapons Rama is not enfeebled, as with the enormous 
Mt. Meru that can withstand even if battered by very many highly blazing thunderbolts of Indra. 
Bruised and bedaubed with blood on all his limbs that Rama of Raghu's dynasty took shape of the sun 
enshrouded by cloudscapes at eventide. 
On seeing lone Rama beset by many demons, then the gods, celestials, saints and sublime-sages are dispirited. 

But Rama on becoming highly infuriated curved his bow to a full circularity on stretching the bowstring 
up to his ear, and then jetted out trenchant arrows in hundreds. Why hundreds? He surged them in thousands. 

In that war Rama sportily discharged eagle-feathered arrows adorned in gold which are unstoppable and 
intolerable, and which in simile are the leads of Time-god. 
Those arrows that are playfully discharged on the army of enemy have grabbed the lives of demons like 
the tethers flung by the Time-god. 
On impaling the bodies demons, the arrows swamped in blood have gone into welkin, where they are aglow 
with flares equalling inflamed flames. 
Innumerable and highly frightening arrows fusilladed from the nimbus of the bow of Rama that resulted 
as the filchers of the lives of demons. 
In that war, shooting now with hundreds, and now with thousands of such arrows, Rama shredded those 
many bows, pinnacles of war-flags, armours and the like. And even shred are the heads of demons, along 
with their ornamented arms and thighs similar to the trunks of elephants. 
With the arrows flung from the bow-bowstring-nimbus of Rama, he indeed shredded and scraped the horses 
hitched with golden harnesses, and the chariots to which they are yoked, and even their charioteers. 
Likewise, he even ripped off the elephants along with their riders, and the horses along with their 
cavaliers. And on eliminating infantrymen in that war Rama led them to the abode of Yama, the Time-god. 
 
While ripped to pieces with tubular arrows, with arrows made of iron, and with sharp-edged and crescent-tipped 
arrows those demons have let out disgusting cries of anguish. 
When those arrows that gore the critical parts are thus harrowing, that army is discomposed like a forest 
burnt to a cinder by wild-fire. 
Some of the grotesquely sinewy and braving nightwalkers are highly enraged and dashed their darts, tridents, 
and hatchets towards Rama. 
On fending off those weapons with his arrows that mighty armed and valorous Rama filched away their 
lives by shearing off their necks in that war. 
Those demons crashed down to earth with their heads severed and shields and bows wrecked, like the trees 
strewn around on earth owing to the gust raised by Garuda, the Divine Eagle, when he takes a sudden 
flight in heavens. 
Those nightwalkers that are battered by those arrows and remaining there, they desperately rushed towards 
Khara alone seeking shelter. 
Comforting all of them and taking his bow, very highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards that infuriated 
Rama like the furious Eliminator Yama.
That highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards Rama as highly infuriated Yama rushes towards Rudra, 
where Rudra being the ultimate eliminator himself, angry rush of Yama towards Rudra is therefore futile. 

Coming under the shelter of Duushana all of those demons are but emboldened and returned, and they once 
again rushed towards Rama with saala trees, palm trees and boulders as their weapons. 
Handling tridents, maces, and leashes those great-mighty demons have created torrents of arrows, missiles, 
trees and boulders, and inundated Rama in that war. 
Again there chanced a highly gruesome war between Rama and those demons that is tumultuous, stunning, 
and a hair-raising. 
Those demons have resurfaced from all around pressurising Raghava in high dudgeon. On seeing the reappearance 
of demons from everywhere, with whom all the directions and inter-directions are fully filled, and who 
are storming torrents of arrows, then that exceptionally forceful Rama made a thunderous sound and launched 
an extremely blazing missile among the gather of demons, called gandharva missile. 
Then from the nimbus of his bow, arrows in thousand have scurried out, and with them thus arrived all 
the ten sides are cramped up. 
Either the drawing of those supreme arrows from the quiver, or the traction of bowstring on placing 
them, or unloosing them from the bow is unperceived by those demons that are harrowing under those arrows. 

Darkness caused by the thick of the arrows overspread the sky including its sun, while Rama happened 
to persevere spewing forth his arrows. 
Far and wide the earth is scattered with herds that are falling instantaneously, hosts that have fallen 
instantly, and huddles that are already felled with an instantaneity. 
Thousands of demons are noticeable hither and yon, killed, fallen and enfeebled, and slashed, gashed 
and ripped. 
Some severed heads still have their headgears and some bare, some arms are with armlets and some bare, 
while some with their arms cut off, some with their thighs cut off, some with their divers patterns 
of ornaments on their bodies have fallen on ground. Numerous horses and elephants are felled. Chariots, 
royal-fans, royal-parasols, war-flags of very many kinds are ravaged in many ways. Hit down by Rama's 
arrows spears and tridents are variously splintered, swords broken to pieces, darts and hatchets shattered 
and strewn around. Also the boulders are pulverised, various amazing arrows have gone to rack and ruin 
in many ways. Spread with such wreckage the earth has become horrifying for a glance. 
On seeing the killed demons all the surviving demons have become enervated and they are rendered incapable 
to make a move towards Rama, the conqueror of enemy's capitals. "Once there was a highly righteous kingly sage who is the brainchild 
			of Brahma, whose ascesis is of higher order, who has never flouted the 
			rules of rituals or his vows, and who revered the knowers of virtue 
			by name Kusha." Thus Sage Vishvamitra commenced narration. 
"That great-souled Kusha begot four selfsame and mighty sons, namely 
			Kushamba, Kushanaabha, Adhuurtarajasa also called as Asuurtarajasa,  
			and Vasu through the princess of Vidarbha, which princess is of noble 
			birth and an eligible wife of Kusha. 
"With an aspiration that his sons shall uphold the principles of Kshatriya-s, 
			Kusha spoke to them who are brilliant, highly enthusiastic, virtue abiding, 
			and the advocators of truth saying, 'establish your rulership, sons, 
			and achieve righteousness abundantly.' 
"On hearing the words of Kusha those four sons that are the formidable 
			ones in the world and the best men among people initiated to build four 
			cities. 
"Great-resplendent Kushamba built the city named Kaushambii for his 
			part, and for his part the virtue-souled Kushanaabha built a city named 
			Mahodaya. 
"Oh, Rama, noble-minded Adhuurtarajasa built a city named Dharmaaranya, 
			and king Vasu built a city in the name of Girivraja. 
"This land on which we are presently staying is known as the land of 
			virtue-souled Vasu, all around which these five best mountains are standing 
			high. 
"This charming river that enters and exits Magadha province is well 
			known as the worthy River Maagadhi, and flowing amid the five of these 
			elevated mountains it shines forth like a garland enwreathing them. 
			
"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great mighty princes
							 are rendered incapable to string its bowstring.
"This Maagadhi is that river which pertains to the developmental works 
			of the great-souled king Vasu and oh, Rama, flowing towards east to 
			its confluence in Ganga, this river garlands best farmlands and their 
			crops on its way. 
"The virtue-souled kingly saint Kushanaabha gave birth to a hundred 
			daughters with unexcelled beauty through a celestial female called Ghritaachi. 
			
"Those girls when attained youthfulness they are lovely and on an occasion 
			they have gone to gardens and moved there about like one lightning with 
			a hundred streaks during rainy season, and while those girls that are 
			decorated with select ornaments are singing, dancing and playing musical 
			instruments, they got into a fantastic felicity. 
"On their coming to parklands those girls whose all limbs are pretty 
			and whose looks are unparalleled on earth, they looked like stars amid 
			clouds within the cloudy thickets of garden bushes. 
"On seeing them who are flourishing with all their aspects together 
			with comeliness and ripeness, the all pervading Air-god, Vayu, spoke 
			this word to them. 
" 'I have a desire for you all, hence leaving off the notions pertaining 
			to human beings you all become my wives, thereby you too will acquire 
			longevity like divinities. 
" 'Teenage is always transitory, expressly in humans, but on marrying 
			me you will achieve undiminished youthfulness and forever you can be 
			youthful like immortal females.' Thus Air-god said to those girls. 
"On hearing that proposal of Vayu, the Air-god whose strives are unimpeded, 
			then those hundred girls spoke this sentence laughing off his proposal. 
			
" 'we are aware that you inspirit all the living beings from inside, 
			oh, the ablest divinity, we are also aware of your uniqueness. But, 
			what for you are dishonouring all of us. 
" 'We are the daughters of Kushanaabha, oh, best divinity, and we are 
			all capable of displacing you from your realm, but oh, god, we are restraining 
			ourselves in doing so only to conserve our ascetic values. 
" 'That time shall never come, oh, god with sordid thinking, when we, 
			at our liberty, may look up for our grooms overlooking our veracious 
			father.' 
" 'Our father is indeed our lord and for us he is the ultimate god too. 
			To whomever we are offered by our father in marriage he alone becomes 
			our husband.' So said hundred girls to Air-god. 
On hearing their sentence of rejection, Vayu, the Air-god whose impact 
			is powerful, very angrily entered into all of the limbs of those girls 
			only to disfigure them. 
"Those girls whom Air-god disfigured in that way have entered palace-chambers 
			of the king, but they have entered diffidently, embarrassedly, and tearfully. 
			
"That king on seeing his dear and attractive daughters as disfigured 
			and despondent girls he is highly perturbed and said this. 
" 'Oh, daughters, what all is this? Who disregarded probity? Who disfigured 
			you all? Let it be said! Why you gesticulate saying nothing.' asking 
			thus that king sighed and quietened down waiting for a reply." Thus 
			Sage Vishvamitra continued his narration. On the competition of the horse ritual of high-souled Dasharatha, the golds having received 
their portion of sacrificial oblation returned to their abodes as they have come. 
The king completing his consecratory vows held for horse ritual, entered Ayodhya city along 
with the company of his queens, servants, guards and vehicles. 
The other kings who arrived for the ritual are delighted when befittingly honoured by the 
king Dasharatha, and they too returned to their countries, after suitably adoring the eminent 
sage Vashishta. 
The entourages of those kings who set forth homeward from that city are highly gladdened and 
shone forth in fine fettle. 
On the departure of visiting kings, then that fortunate king Dasharatha entered the city Ayodhya, 
keeping eminent Brahman priests ahead of him in the procession. 
Well adored by king Dasharatha sage Rishyasringa also travelled along with his wife Shanta, 
followed by his father-in-law King Romapada, and along with other co-travellers, namely the 
entourage of Romapada. 
On dispersing all of them king Dasharatha gratifyingly dwelled there in Ayodhya, with a satiated 
heart dwelling upon the birth of his sons. 
On completion of the ritual, six seasons have passed by; then in the twelfth month, i.e., 
inchaitra-mAsa, and on the ninth day of thatchaitramonth , 
when it ispunarvasunakShatrayukta-navamI tithi, i.e., when the ruling star of that 
ninth day ispunarvasu,for which Aditi is the presiding deity; and when five of the nine planets -sUrya, kuja, guru, 
shukra, shaniare inucChasthAna-s, namely, when those planets are in 
ascension in their respective houses -meSha, makara, karkaTa, mIna, tula - rAshI-s; and whenchandrayukta- 
guru, karkaTalagne- Jupiter in conjuction with Moon is ascendant in Cancer, and when day is advancing, 
Queen Kausalya gave birth to a son with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, 
lengthy arms, roseate lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku 
dynasty and adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, 
namely Rama. 
Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month 
of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to 
take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be 
known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory of the grand line of Ikshwku, and 
the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was 
chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension 
in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and 
the Moon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled 
effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the 
Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, .
Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who 
once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods. 
Queen Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, one embodied with all merits, and whose truthfulness 
itself is his valour and who is fourth component of manifest Vishnu, namely Rama. 
Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely 
Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry. 
With the dawn of sun on the next day, fair-minded Bharata is born under Pisces wherepuSyamiis the star of day, later the sons of Sumitra, namely Lakshmana and Shatrughna are 
			born under Cancer, whereaashleSais the star of the 
			day, i.e., the tenth of chaitra month, 
Thus there are four great-souled sons of Dasharatha, born on separate instances, who are virtuous, 
charming, and by brilliance they are in similitude with two stars of each of the asterisms 
calledpuurvaabhaadraanduttaraabhaadra. 

The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums 
drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with 
thronging people. 
Hilarity filled the streets with people stampeding them and with the flurry of actors, dancers, 
singers and instrumentalists, as well by other onlookers, and there on the streets widely 
strewn are all kinds of gems appreciating the artists. 
The king gave worthy gifts to eulogisers, bard singers, and panegyrists, and to Brahmans he 
gave funds and wealth in the form of thousands of cows. 
Elapsed are eleven days and the naming ceremony is performed, then Vashishta, the chief priest, 
named the high-souled elder one as Rama, Kaikeyi's son as Bharata, and one son of Sumitra 
as Lakshmana and the other as Shatrughna 
The king feasted Brahmans, urbanites and villagers and he gifted many valuable gems to Brahmans 
in an unlimited way, and all the rituals of birth and ceremonies sequel to it like naming 
ceremony, first-food-feeding ceremony, first-hair-removal ceremony, and sacred thread ceremony 
are performed in respect of the princes. 
Among those princes the eldest one Rama is like a flagstaff and a delight of his father Dasharatha, 
and he became acceptable to all beings like the self-created Brahma. 
All the princes are scholars in Veda-s, valiant ones, all are interested in the welfare of 
the world, all are intellectuals and all of them possess an air of probity. 
Among them the great resplendent Rama, whose valour itself is his truthfulness, is the dear 
one to all the world like the tranquil moon. 
Rama is admittedly a champion of riding elephants and horses, also in tactical charioting, 
and he rejoices in the art of archery, and absorbed in the obedient service of his father. 

Right from childhood Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, is always amiable towards his 
world-charming elder brother Rama. 
Lakshmana who is endowed with the wealth of dedication dedicated himself to Rama with bodily 
service, and while performing all agreeable deeds in respect of Rama, he behaved like Rama's 
alter ego. 
That best one among the men Rama does not get his sleep without Lakshmana and he would 
not eat food brought for him, however delicious it may be, without Lakshmana. 
Whenever Raghava mounts a horse and goes on a hunting game Lakshmana rushes after him wielding 
his bow as a squire. 
Lakshmana's younger brother Shatrughna is a dear one to Bharata, like that Bharata too held 
Shatrughna dearer than his own lives. 
King Dasharatha is highly gladdened with four of his highly fortunate sons like the Forefather 
Brahma with gods in heaven. 
When all of the four sons are thus prospering with prudence, gifted with all the merits, self-conscious 
to do wrong deeds, well-known for their gentility, knowers of pros and cons and even the conscientious 
princes, then their father Dasharatha is contented in respect of all of them who are such 
radiantly brilliant and potential princes, like Brahma. 
Even those tigerly-men, namely the princes, are engrossed in the studies of Veda-s, delighted 
to render service to their father and they are also the experts in art of archery. 
Then the noble souled Dasharatha contemplated along with his priestly teachers and relatives 
about the matrimonial alliances of his sons. 
While the great souled Dasharatha is discussing the marriages of princes among his ministers, 
the highly powerful sage Vishvamitra arrived. 
Desirous to have an audience with king Vishvamitra said to the doorkeeper, "Let the king be 
informed quickly that I, the son of Gadhi from the dynasty of Kushi, have come" 
On listening those words all the doorkeepers are dumbfounded, and ushered by those words they 
quickly rushed to the place of Dasharatha. 
Then on their arriving at the king's palace the doorkeepers have announced to the king of 
Ikshvaku-s, namely Dasharatha, about the arrival of sage Vishvamitra. 
On hearing that message from doorkeepers Dasharatha is highly pleased and he has gone towards 
Vishvamitra in a self-possessed manner along with royal priests, as Indra would ceremoniously 
go towards Brahma. 
Then on seeing the resplendent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is by his own ascesis and 
who has severe self-discipline, the king offered water with a gladsome aspect, as first customary 
hospitality in receiving unexpected guest. 
On receiving water from the king scripturally and customarily Vishvamitra enquired after the 
well-being and welfare of king Dasharatha. 
That highly righteous sage Vishvamitra asked the king after the well-being of city, exchequer, 
rural areas, friends and relatives. 
Sage Vishvamitra asked Dasharatha, "Are all of the provincial kings acquiescent to you, and 
all your enemies conquered? Are you properly performing the devotional and social works?" 

And on meeting the eminent sage Vashishta and with them the other exalted sages according 
to custom Vishvamitra asked after their well-being. 
Then adoringly invited by the king Dasharatha all of them gladly entered the palace and they 
took their seats according to protocol. 
Then the very generous king Dasharatha is gladdened at heart at the arrival of Vishvamitra, 
and he spoke this way feeling happy to adore that sage. 
"I deem your arrival is in the vein of mortals attaining ambrosia, rainfall in a droughty 
land, a barren father begetting a son through his deserving wife, a regain of long lost treasures, 
and the gladness at a great happening, oh, great saint, welcome to you." 
"Oh, Brahman, as I am the one who is delighted for your arrival, and as you are the most eligible 
recipient from me, what is that choicest object of yours to be fulfilled by me, and in which 
way. Oh, endower of respect, for me your arrival is fortunate whereby my birth is fructified 
and my life flourished today, and wherefore I could see a great Brahman like you visiting 
my home, therefore the sun appears to have dawned in my night. 
"Originally your glory was explicit by your title kingly-sage, and subsequently you 
attained the Absolute-sainthood by your ascesis, and you are venerable to me, in many 
ways." 
"Oh, Brahman, thereby your arrival at my place is surprising and ideally sacred to me, and 
by your very appearance I have become one who has gone on a quiet pilgrimage. 
"You may tell me, entreating which work your arrival chanced here and I feel that I am indeed 
blessed and wish to make it happen to achieve results. 
"It is unapt of you to deliberate about the feasibility of the work, oh, sage with blest vows, 
while I am the fulfiller of it without any reminder, since you are god to me, indeed. 
"Oh, Brahman, this is the great prosperity that bechanced on me, and this is propriety in 
its entirety that bechanced on me, as a result of your arrival. 
On hearing the words of high-minded Dasharatha, said that way in all his humbleness, and those 
that are pleasant to ears as well to heart, he who is a renowned for his personal attributes 
and a reputed one by his exceptional qualities, that sublime sage Vishvamitra obtained high 
rejoice. When Vashishta said that way king Dasharatha with an air of satisfaction personally 
			fetched Rama along with Lakshmana. 
Rama is blessed for a propitious travel firstly by his mother Kausalya and then 
			by his father king Dasharatha, thereupon the royal priest Vashishta rendered Vedic 
			hymns blessing the journey, then Dasharatha well pleased in his heart of hearts 
			kissed his son Rama on forehead and entrusted him to Vishvamitra. 
Then on seeing the lotus-eyed Rama following Vishvamitra, dustless 
			and pleasant for touch breeze blew. 
When the great-souled Rama forged ahead there occurred an abounding downpour of 
			flowers with the booming of divine drums, together with the boom and blare of 
			drums and conch-shells of Ayodhya. 
Rama with jet-black hair-locks handling his bow followed Vishvamitra who walked 
			ahead, while Lakshmana handling his own bow followed Rama. 
Rama and Lakshmana, with two quivers each and two bows in their hands, and making 
			all the ten directions of compass lambent followed Vishvamitra, as if three headed 
			serpents followed Vishvamitra, and with their highly dynamic physiques and spiritedness 
			they look as if like the Ashwin twin gods of unequal charm following Brahma, the 
			Forefather. 
Those two youngsters with charming and bejewelled physiques are handling bows 
			and swords and their fingers have leathern covers. Both the unreprovable brothers 
			Rama and Lakshmana are highly resplendent and effulgent by their worth. While 
			they are following Vishvamitra they looked like the sons of Fire-god, namely Skanda 
			and Vishakha, following the great god with inscrutable potential, namely Shiva, 
			and thus the brothers have made Vishvamitra to shine forth in even pose with god 
			Shiva. 
And on going one and half yojana distance Vishvamitra addressed Rama in a harmonious 
			voice calling, 'oh, Rama', on the southern riverbank of Sarayu. 
" "Take water, my boy, and like that you receive a group of hymns,balaandatibalafrom 
			me, and let no time lapse. 
"On receiving these hymns neither tiredness nor fever, nor disfiguring of personality 
			can effect you, nor the demons can charge you either you are sleeping or unvigilant. 
			
"As it is none whosoever on earth can equal you in dexterity, Rama, and by reciting 
			these hymns none can equal you in the three worlds. 
"My dear Raghava, if bala atibala hymns are practised, oh, impeccable one, none 
			can equal you in the world by your handsomeness, calibre, erudition, by your discernment, 
			and even in replying or rebutting you. 
"On receiving these two teachings there will be none similar to you, for bala 
			and atibala are the mothers of all knowledge. 
"Oh, best one among men, Raghava, if you go on reciting bala and atiblala hymns, 
			my dear Rama, there will be no hunger or thirst to you. 
"And if these twin teachings are practised an inestimable renown will also accrue, 
			oh, Raghu's legatee, these two hymns that possess brilliance are the daughters 
			of Forefather Brahma, and oh, Rama of Kakutstha, I intend to impart these hymns 
			to you, oh virtuous one, as you are the most eligible one, hence take the teachings 
			that are kept safe from the world. 
"Though all of these numerous qualities are undoubtedly available with you, that 
			too in abundance, yet these hymns if ascetically nurtured will yield various results." 
			Thus spoke Sage Vishvamitra to Rama. 
Then Rama on touching water to purify himself received those teachings from the 
			contemplative soul Vishvamitra with gladness beaming on his face. 
Rama, the one with marvellous valiance, on obtaining those teachings performed 
			all his duties of a student in respect of a teacher and then shone forth like 
			the thousand rayed sun on a cloudless sky of autumn. Then those three very happily 
			stayed on the riverbank of Sarayu for that night. 
Though both Rama and Lakshmana slept on an undeserving grass bed, nestled by the 
			comfortable words of Vishvamitra that night is as though pleasant to the noteworthy 
			children of Dasharatha. 
Sage Vishvamitra is the Seer for Gayatri hymn. He is the same Sage to impartbalaatibalahymns to Rama and Lakshmana. For those readers that are interested to know or to practice, 
the Upanishad ofbalaatibalais included hereunder. This hymn is yet another 
aspect of Gayatri, and there is no hymn superior than Gayatri,na gaayatryaaH 
paramam japamIntroduction:
Valmiki describes the innumerable virtues of Sree Rama in this sarga. Dasaratha wants to coronate Rama as the crown prince with the approval of all his people. With this end in mind, he invites various citizens, important people from all cities and villages in his kingdom.
Bharatha, while going to his maternal uncle's house, has taken his brother Satrughna (he who has no sins and who annihilates his enemies) along with him with love.
Treated with good hospitality and paternal love by his maternal uncle, Yudhajit, who was a lord of cavalry, Bharatha stayed with his brother there.
Those heroes of valour Bharatha and Satrughna, though staying there enjoying all the comforts, were remembering their age old father.
The mighty Dasaratha was also often remembering his sons Bharatha and Satrughna who were out of his state and who were equivalent to Indra and Varuna.
Dasaratha was bestowing his equal love to all his four sons who were best among men, as though they were his four hands emerging out of his own body.
Rama, like the Brahma among all the living beings, the most virtuous among those brothers and the mightiest was a great source of joy for his father.
That Rama - was He not the eternal Vishnu who was born on earth as prayed by celestials to kill the egoistic Ravana?
Like Adithi by Indra, best among the celestials, Kausalya shone by her son Rama, the mighty.
Rama was beautiful in form, a hero of valor and without envy. By virtues, he was like Dasaratha. In this way, he was an incomparable son on earth.
That Rama was always peaceful in mind and spoke softly. He did not react even to the hard words spoken by others.
That Rama, because of his good bent of mind, feels glad even by whatever way a good thing is done to him. He does not remember any number of bad things done to him.
Whenever he finds some time even while practising archery, Rama used to converse with elderly people, elder by way of conduct or wisdom or age or with good- natured people.
Rama was a wise man. He used to speak sweetly. He was the first man to initiate a talk. His speech was compassionate. He was valorous. But he was not arrogant of his mighty valor.
He did not speak untruth. He was all knowing. He used to be receptive and worshipful to the elders. People used to love him and he used to love the people.
He had compassion. He conquered anger. He used to be receptive and worshipful to the wise. He had mercy towards the meek. He knew what was to be done. He had always self-control. He was clean (in conduct).
That Rama, having an attitude suitable for his social rank, giving due respect to righteousness of warrior-class, believed that by following the righteousness he would attain great fame and through it the fruit of heaven.
That Rama, having an attitude suitable for his social rank, giving due respect to righteousness of warrior-class, believed that by following the righteousness he would attain great fame and through it the fruit of heaven.
Rama was a young man without any disease. He was a good speaker. He had a good body. He knew both time and place. He could grasp the essence of men. He was the one gentleman born on earth.
People loved the virtuous prince Rama and treated him as their spirit moving outside.
After completing his education properly, Rama, after knowing the veda along with vedanga-s as prescribed, became better than his father in the use of bow and arrows.
Rama, having born in a good clan, was gentle minded. He was not feeble. He spoke truth. He was straightforward. He was properly trained by elderly brahmana's those who knew righteousness.
Rama knew the real form of desire, wealth and righteousness. He had a good memory power. He had a spontaneous wisdom. He had skills in arranging customs useful to society prevalent at that time.
Rama was humble. He did not let his feelings appear outwardly. He kept his thoughts to himself. He helped others. His anger and pleasure were not wasteful. He knew when to give and when not to give.
Rama had a firm devotion and steadfast mind. He was not stubborn nor did he speak evil words. He was free from idleness and was ever alert. He recognized his own errors and those of others.
Rama knew the theory and practice of sciences. He understood the differences among men. He could judiciously discriminate whom to protect and whom to punish.
He identified good men and protected them. He knew the people worthy of reprimand. He knew the ways and means of getting income as well as the system of spending, as perceived by economic sciences.
Rama could obtain great skill in the groups of sciences along with their subsidiaries. He was interested in enjoying comforts only after understanding the economy and virtues. He never remained inactive.
Rama was acquainted with the fine arts useful for entertainment. He knew how to distribute the wealth. He was efficient in riding and also taming of elephants and horses.
Rama was the best of persons knowing the science of archery in the world; and was well appreciated by the champions of archery. He attained skills in marshalling the army. He faced and killed the enemies in battle.
Even enraged celestials and demons could not defeat Rama in battle. He had no jealousy. He conquered anger. He had no arrogance and envy. He had not even humiliated any living being. He had not surrendered to time.
That Prince Rama, with these good virtues, was fair to the people. He was agreeable to the three worlds. By patience and the related virtues, he was equal to earth, by wisdom to Brihaspathi and by valor to Devendra.
Rama, by his virtues, was a source of happiness to all the people and a spring of joy to his father. As the sun shines with his rays, Rama was shining, thus, with his virtues.
The earth wished Rama to be her Lord as he was adorned with self -control and norms of behavior bearing undefeatable valor equal to that of universal lords like Indra.
Dasaratha, who annihilates enemies, started thinking as follows after observing his son with his many incomparable virtues.
The long living and aged Dasaratha thought: "Will Rama become king while I am still alive? Shall I enjoy that happiness?"
A great loving thought was ringing in his mind that when he would be able to see his beloved son Rama crowned as a king.
"Is not Rama, as a raining cloud to the earth, better liked by people than me, as he desires the development of the world and has compassion towards all living beings."
"Rama is equal to Yama and Devendra in valor, to Brihaspati in wisdom and to a mountain in courage. He is more virtuous also than me."
"Shall I attain heaven, after seeing in this age, my son ruling the entire earth?"
Rama had many other virtues beyond hitherto stated virtues not to be seen in other kings. His virtues cannot be counted and they are the best in the world. Seeing that type of virtuous Rama, Dasaratha along with his ministers, decided to make Rama the prince.
The wise Dasaratha observed that there was sign of a great alarm being forecast because of bad omens found in earth heaven and the sky. He also told the ministers that his body was getting aged.
He recognized that if Rama were crowned as king, he would not have worries as Rama had beautiful face as a full moon; was a great wise man; and was liked by the people.
The righteous Dasaratha was hurried with concern in the coronation of Rama as it is for his own benefit and for the benefit of people. Because it is as per his liking and also as the appropriate time has come.
Dasaratha called for other kings and officers staying in various cities and villages in his kingdom separately.
The hurried Dasaratha did not call for the king Kekaya, the maternal uncle of Bharatha or the King Janaka as he thought they both could hear the good news even afterwards.
The king Dasaratha presented them suitably with houses and jewelry. Duly adorned himself, he looked after them in the manner Lord Brahma looks after his children.
All the invited kings, duly liked by their people, entered the assembly after the king Dasaratha , who annihilates the opponent's army, occupied his seat.
The kings thus entered, occupied their various seats allotted to them by the king, by facing toward the king as per the prescribed rules.
Surrounded by the respected and humble kings sitting closely to him as well as the important heads of cities and villages, king Dasaratha shone like lord Devendra surrounded by celestials.The evil- minded Ravana the ten-faced monster, who had fallen under the sway of Death; 
could not brook that beneficial advice tendered by Malyavan.
He had fallen under the sway of anger, knitting his brows on the face as he was, rolling 
his eyes in fury and spoke to Malyavan (as follows)
"I have closed my ears to the speech you have made, albeit with good intentions and even 
by taking sides with the enemy."
"How can you hold Rama, who is a mere human being, a small feeble man, taking help from 
monkeys and dwelling in a forest having been abandoned by his father, to be a competent person?"
"How can you hold me, the Lord of demons, terrifying celestials and possessing all powers 
in full, to be a weaker person?"
"I suspect that you spoke these harsh words to me because of your envy of my prowess 
or your partiality towards the enemies or my lenience towards you."
"Which learned man, understand the truth in the scriptures, would speak thus harshly 
to a mighty person in power, were it not to instigate him?"
"Why should I give back Seetha, who is like Lakshmi the goddess of fortune without the 
lotus, having brought her away from the forest, through fear of Rama?"
"See Rama killed within a few days by me, along with Lakshama together with Sugreeva 
in the midst of crores of monkeys."
"How should this Ravana, whom in combat, the celestials themselves dare not meet in a 
duel, entertain fear in this encounter?"
"Rather would I be cut into two pieces than bend before anybody! Such was I from birth, 
it is my nature by difacult and unalterable."
"What great marvel is there in that which gave way to terror if by happy chance, a bridge 
indeed was constructed by Rama across the ocean."
"That Rama along with his army of monkeys, having crossed the ocean, will not go back 
alive. It is my true promise to you."
Beholding Ravana to be highly excited and speaking with such fury, Malyavan, abashed, 
did not reply.
Invoking blessings of victory to the king as courtesy demanded Malyavan took permission 
and went home.
Ravana the demon on his part, assisted by his ministers having deliberated on the things 
to be examined, set about planning the defense of Lanka.
Thereafter, he assigned the eastern gate to the demon, Prahasta and the southern gate 
to Maha Parshva and Mhodara both of great prowess. At the western gate, he placed his son Indrajit, 
a powerful conjuror, with considerable force of demons.
Placing Shuka and Sarana at the northern city-gate, Ravana told his ministers that he 
would go there personally.
He place the demon Virupaksha, who was full of energy and courage, to be in the center 
of the fort, with a large number of demons.
Making an arrangement in Lanka in this manner, that bull among demons, under the sway 
of Time, deemed his purpose as accomplished.
Having ordered for adequate arrangements for the defence of the city, Ravana then let 
his ministers depart. Having been honoured with blessings of victory by the body of counsellors, he 
entered his mighty and sumptuous inner apartments.Thereafter, surveying the earth and the sky, the monkeys beheld the brothers Rama
and Lakshmana, covered with arrows.
Then, along with Sugreeva, Vibhishana came to that place, after Indrajit finished
his work and retired; even as Indra* would, after raining.
Nila, Dvivida, Mainda, Sushena, kumuda, Angada along with Hanuman forthwith began to
grieve for Rama and Lakshmana.
Breathing but faintly, bathed in blood; riddled with innumerable arrows, motionless
and lying inactive, they lay stretched on a bed of arrows, sighing like serpants, helpless, having
little prowess, their limbs smeared with a stream of blood, resembling two golden standards, and
lying on heroes' couch, those warriors with tardy movement of their limbs, were surrounded by their
monkey-leaders, whose eyes were suffused with tears. Seeing the two Raghavas, pierced by a
multitude of arrows, all the monkeys along with Vibhishana became perturbed.
The monkeys surveyed all the quarters in the sky, without being able to discover
Indrajit (the son of Ravana), who was veiled by his magic powers in the fight.
Vibhishana, beholding by his magic arts, saw that nephew, standing nearby, duly
hidden by his occult power.
Althought that warrior who had no peer in the field and who had unique exploits, had
made himself invisible by virtue of the boon he had received, he was recognized by Vibhishana, who
was full of energy, glory and prowess.
Contemplating his own feat, Indrajit gazed on those two warriors, stretched on the
earth and in excess of joy, wishing to share it with all the demons, said.
"The exceedingly strong brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the killers of Khara and
Dushana have been killed by my arrows."
"Even were they aided by the gods and demons with the host of sages, these two
brothers would never be able to release themselves from those arrows that paralyse them."
"This non- sensical pest, which was wearing away the very roots of us all, on whose
account, the three watches of the night slipped past my father, who is unable even to touch his
couch with his limbs, who remains absorbed in thought and stricken with grief and because of whom,
the entire city of Lanka remains agitated, like a river during the rains, has ban destroyed by
me."
"As clouds are useless in the autumn, so are all the exploits of Rama, Lakshmana and
all the monkeys."
Thus speaking to all those demons, Indrajit the son of Ravana (by his arrows0 struck
the monkey chief.
Striking Nila with nine arrows, Indrajit the destroyer of foes tormented Mainda and
Dvivida with three superb arrows on each.
Indrajit the wielder of a great bow smacked the chest-region of Jambavan with an
arrow and released ten arrows towards Hanuman, the swift monkey.
Indrajit the son of Ravana of great swiftness, struck both Gavaksha and Sharabha of
unbounded valour with two arrows on each of them, in that battle.
Thereafter, Indrajit the son of Ravana swiftly with his various arrows, struck
Gavaksha (the ruler of golangulas) and then Angada the son of Vali too.
Indrajit, that strong and highly courageous demons, pierced those jewels among the
monkeys there with his arrows which resembled flames of fire and began to shout in triumph.
Tormenting them with a multitude of arrows and frightening the monkeys, the mighty
armed Indrajit heartily laughed and spoke (as follows).
"O, demons! At the forefront of the army, behold those two brothers (Rama and
Lakshmana) bound together by me by a terrible net work of my arrows."
All those demons, the treacherous fighters on their part, after hearing the words of
Indrajit, were seized with a great wonder and were overjoyed.
All of them cheered Indrajit unanimously with a roar like unto thunder, crying "Rama
is dead".
Seeing the two brothers - Rama and Lakshmana lying motionless and breathless on the
floor, Indrajit thought they were dead.
Indrajit, full of joy and victorious in conflict, returned to Lanka, spreading
happiness among the demons.
Seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddle with arrows and pierced in every limb and bone of
their bodies, a great fear had taken possession of Sugreeva.
Vibhishana then spoke to that Sugreeva, who was frightened, whose eyes were filled
with tears, looking helpless and whose eyes were agitated in grief.
"Have no fear, O Sugreeva! Stay this rush of tears. Wars are like this. Victory is
not certain."
"O, warrior! If a remnance of luck is there with us, the highly-souled and the
exceedingly strong Rama and Lakshmana will drive off this loss of consciousness."
"O, Sugreeva! Be courageous and bring about courage in me, having no protector. For
those who are devoted to truth and righteousness, there is no fear of death."
Thus speaking, Vibhishana then wiped the charming eyes of Sugreeva with his hand
moistened in water.
Then, the pious minded Vibhishana took water, enchanted it with an incantation and
wiped the eyes of Sugreeva.
Having dried the face of the wise Sugreeva Vibhishana spoke the following words full
of good sense and comfort.
"O, Sugreeva the king of monkeys! This is not the time to cling to despondency. At
this hour, even too much attachment leads to death."
"Therefore, abandoning your despair, which ruins all actions, focus now on how best
to serve the troops which have Rama going before them.
"Or else, let Rama be protected till he regains consciousness. Having regained
consciousness, Rama and Lakshmana can indeed drive away the fear of both of us."
"This is nothing to Rama nor Rama is going to die. The bodily splendour, which is
difficult to be found in those whose longevity of life has run out; is not abandoning him."
"Therefore console yourself and call on your prowess, till I restore confidence in
the entire ranks."
"O, the foremost of monkeys! These monkeys, having their eyes dilated due to fear,
are signaling some words into each other's ear, terrified as they were."
"Let the monkeys cast off their fear, even as one would discard a used garland, on
seeing me running about to activate the troops."
Having emboldened Sugreeva, Vibhishana the foremost of demons once again reassured
that army of monkeys, who were pushing away.
Indrajit, the great conjurer, surrounded by all his forces, re-entered the city of
Lanka.
Approaching Ravana there and saluting with joined palms, Indrajit informed his
father in pleasing words that both Rama and Lakshmana had been slain.
Hearing in the midst of demons, the news that both the enemies having been killed,
Ravana forthwith sprang on his feet in joy and embraced his son.
Smelling on his head, Ravana delighted at heard, made enquiries in the matter.
Indrajit reported the matter as it happened, to his enquiring father, as to how both Rama and
Lakshmana were made motion-less and luster-less by entwining them with arrows.
Hearing the words of Indrajit the great charioteer, Ravana with his heart filled
with a gush of joy, relinquished his anguish, caused on account of Rama and applauded his son with
pleasing words.Hearing of Akampana's killing, Ravana the Lord of demons, with a little depressed
face, was enraged and looked towards his ministers.
Having reflected awhile and deliberated with his ministers, Ravana the king of
Demons then passed that forenoon in inspecting his defenses in the City of Lanka.
The king Ravana saw that City, guarded by groups of demons, filled with innumerable
troops and decorated with banners and flags.
Seeing Lanka besieged, Ravana the Lord of Demons spoke as follows to Prahasta who
was skilled in war-fare and who wished well of him even at a critical time.
"O, Prahasta the proficient in war-free! I do not see any other deliverance than a
battle for this city, which is besieged suddenly and being devastated."
"Either myself or Kumbhakarna or yourself my army-chief or Indrajit or Nikumbha and
none else could undertake such a task!"
"For that reason, taking a company of warriors, you quickly place yourself in their
midst and set forth in order to triumph over all those monkeys."
"Unsettled in no time on knowing your decision to enter the battle-field, the army
of monkeys will run away on hearing the raring sound of the leaders of demons."
"The monkeys are unsteady, mis-behaved and fickle-minded. They do not tolerate your
sound, as elephants the lion's roar."
"O, Prahasta! As that army takes to its heels, Rama along with Lakshmana being
supportless, will fall into your power though unwillingly."
"A skeptical misfortune is preferable to one that is certain! Whether it is
unpleasing to hear or not, say what you consider as an advantage to us."
Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta the Army-General spoke the following words to
Ravana, like Ushana the preceptor of demons would speak to Bali, the king of demons.
O, king! Formerly, we deliberated this matter with our wise ministers and, after
having a good dialogue with each other, a disagreement arose between us."
"To return Seetha was what I considered preferable. Not to do so meant war; we
foresaw this."
"I have ever been honoured by you at appropriate times by gifts, felicitations and
nice words. When the opportunity arises, is it not for me to render you a service?"
"Neither wives nor sons nor riches are going to be spared by me. See you me,
intending to sacrifice my life for your sake in the battle."
Having spoken thus to Lord Ravana, the General Prahasta said to his leading officers
who stood before him as follows:
"Gather a large army of demons together for me. Today, the flesh-eating birds and
beasts shall feed on the enemy that I strike down on the battle-field with my swift arrows."
Hearing that command of Prahasta, the mighty leaders of the army assembled the
forces in the abode of that demon.
Within a short while, that City of Lanka was filled with those terrific
demon-warriors, resembling elephants and wielding various types of weaponry.
While some demons propitiated the fire-god with their offerings and paid homage to
Brahmanas, a fragrant freeze bearing the scent of clarified butter, began to blow.
Then, the demons who were ready for the battle, delightedly wore garlands of
different shapes, consecrated by certain Mantras (sacred formulas).
Thereafter, armed with bows and armours, the demons with their eyes turned towards
their king Ravana, marched at a brisk pace and ranged themselves round Prahasta.
Then, Prahasta who got ready with his weapons and armour, after bidding obeisance to
the king and striking a terrible kettle-drum, mounted his chariot, which was kept ready, yoked to
an extremely swift horses, well controlled by a charioteer, emanating a noise resembling that of a
large cloud, actually shining like moon-light, inviolable with a flag bearing an ensign of snake,
with a good collision-guard, with nice wheels and decorated with a net of pure gold smiling as it
were in its magnificence.
Then, Prahasta the one who was commanded by Ravana, ascended his chariot and set out
from Lanka soon along with a huge army.
While Prahasta the general sallied forth, the sound of a kettle-drum, the resonance
of musical instruments and the sound of conches were heard, as though filling the earth like the
roar of a cloud.
The demons with terrific forms and bulky bodies, shouting with dreadful voices, went
in front, as forerunners of Prahasta.
He emerged from the eastern gate in the midst of an immense, formidable and orderly
arranged army, resembling a herd of elephants.
In the centre of that army, vast as the sea, that Prahasta in his fury, came forth
appearing like Death at the end of the world.
The uproar that arose on his setting forth with his demons raising the war-cries
drew sinister answering calls from all creatures in Lanka.
In a cloudless sky, birds of prey eating flesh and blood, flew in circles from left
to right towards the chariot.
Fearful jackals vomited forth fire and flames, howling repeatedly. A meteor fell
from the sky and the wind blew harshly.
The plants, in opposition to each other, lost their brilliance. The clouds, with
their raucous sound, showered blood on Prahasta's chariot and dampened those who were walking in
front of it.
A vulture facing the south alighted on the top of the standard, croaking towards
both of its sides and deprived the demon of his entire lustre.
The goad fell several times then from the hand of the charioteer, himself a Suta
(the son of a Kshatriya by a Brahamana woman) eventhough skilled in controlling the horses, as he
entered the battle-field.
That rarely splendour which clothed Prahasta at the time of his exit vanished in an
instant and horses stumbled on the even ground.
Beholding that Prahasta, renowned for his excellences and martial valour; as he
advanced to give battle, the army of monkeys went forward to attack him.
Thereafter, an exceedingly tumultuous clamour arose among the monkeys as they tore
up the trees and seized hold of huge rocks.
Both the armies of the yelling demons and the roaring monkeys were delighted,
impetuous and powerful with impatience to slay each other and challenging each other with great
shouts.
Thereafter, the evil-minded Prahasta sallied forth for victory towards the army of
Sugreeva, whom in his folly, imagined he would destroy, with an accelerated speed as a grass-hopper
rushes towards a flame.Having seen the fearful and the terrible act in Lanka done by Hanuma, like Devendra
the powerful King of celestials, Ravana with his face descended a little with shame, spoke to the
demons as follows:
"By him, who was only a monkey, the irresistible City of Lanka was entered into and
was over-powered. Seetha the daughter of Janaka was also discovered by him.
The thousand-pillared building used as a sanctuary was assaulted by Hanuma. Our most
excellent demons were killed. The entire City of Lanka was made turbid.
May prosperity befall on you! What shall I do? What appropriate thing is to be done
next? Please speak that which is well-answering and that, if attempted becomes well-done.
"Oh, people of great strength! Wise-men say that victory is dependent on good
forethought. Verily for that reason, I desire a deliberation about Rama."
"There are three types of men in the world, namely the foremost the middle most and
the lowest. I am telling their inherent merits and defects."
"The wise call him as the foremost among men, who carries through the beginning of
any undertaking after consulting those who are wedded with welfare of others, or with ministers who
are efficient in conferring decisions or with friends having common interests or additionally with
relatives or who try to get a favour from Providence too."
"The wise men call that man as mediocre, who deliberates about an activity
solitarily, applies his mind on law and justice all by himself and performs works singly."
"He who does not determine the merits and demerits of an act clearly, having
recourse to Providence and neglects his duty by simply telling  I shall do it', he is the lowest
among men."
"In which manner these men are categorized always as good, bad or mediocre, so also
the resolution in thought is classified as good bad or mediocre."
"The wise say that resolution of thought is excellent, in which the thinkers, on a
view perceived by scriptures, obtain consensus and are satisfied with it."
"Only after deliberating several kinds of opinions, that decision of a matter
obtained finally by a consensus of the counselors, is called mediocre."
"That resolution is said to be worst in which several arguments are made, employing
one or the other divergent opinions and in which there is no advantage even after a consensus."
"For that reason, you, having excellent intellect, arrive at a well-thought out
rightful action. To me, this is earnestly to be done."
"Rama surrounded by thousands of courageous monkeys, is coming to the City of Lanka,
for the purpose of besieging us."
"Rama, by his be-fitting strength, can certainly cross the ocean easily, with his
brother along with his army and his companions."
"He may even get the ocean dried up. He may do any other thing by his valour. The
aforesaid act of enmity with monkeys having commenced in this way, advise me everything that is
good for the city and my army.A little of the night was left while Hanuma was searching for Seetha in the garden with 
flowers in blossom.
That Hanuma heard Vedic sounds early in the morning of Brahma Rakshasas well versed in six parts 
of Vedas and those who performed excellent sacrifices.
Thereafter Ravana with great arms and great prowess was woken by the sounds of various auspicious 
musical instruments pleasing to the ear.
The king of rakshasas with great might woke up at the appropriate hour wearing slippery flower 
garlands remembered about Seetha.
In Seetha's matter, directed a lot by the god of love and excited by passion, Rakshasa 
was not capable of suppressing in self that desire.
Together with all the ornaments wearing great glory, Ravana entered the Ashoka garden having a 
lot of trees with all fruits and flowers.
Ravana entered that great wonderful Ashoka garden together with lakes, shone by various flowers, 
brilliant with birds always in a rut.
Ravana entered Ashoka's garden seeing archways of gold and gems crowded by artificial deer of various 
kinds ravishing eyes and minds, filled with animals of various kinds, together with fallen fruits and full of trees.
While He was going only a hundred women followed that Ravana like Deva and Gandharva women following 
Indra.
There some women bore lamps of gold; some others carried chowries; some others had fans of Palmyra 
leaves in their hands.
Some women carried water in small vessels of gold; some others followed in the back taking pillows 
with circular ends.
One woman to the right of Ravana held with her right hand a vessel with gemstones filled with 
liquor.
Another woman went at back taking an umbrella equalling a royal swan with the radiance of full 
moon with a golden handle.
With sleepy eyes best women of Ravana followed their mighty husband like lightning following a cloud.
With displaced necklaces and armlets, with an effaced cover of sandal paste, with disheveled hair, 
and also with sweaty faces, staggering due to surviving a trace of liquor and due to sleepiness, with shriveled 
flowers on perspiring bodies, with disheveled hair along with good garlands, with intoxicating eyes, women who 
were dear wives followed the king of Rakshasas who was going due to respect and due love.
Husband of those women, of great might, who was surrendered to lust, that Ravana also who was dull 
witted, with his mind interested in Seetha shone with a slow and beautiful gait.
Thereafter Hanuma, the son of the wind-god heard the sound of waist-bands and the sound of anklets 
of those excellent women.
Hanuma the monkey saw that Ravana was also, a performer of deeds without an equal, with unfathomable 
might and virility, reaching the entrance region.
Wettened by fragrant oil, being carried in front of Ravana, Hanuma saw Ravana being shone in all 
directions by many lamps.
Hanuma saw Ravana together with lust, vanity, and intoxication, with wide red eyes that were slanted, 
like the god of love in person with a bow kept at a distance.
Hanuma saw Ravana playfully readjusting his excellent upper garment with the luster of churned 
nectar froth, without stain, slipping being entangled in the armlet.
Hanuma blended in a branch full of leaves covered by groups of leaves and flowers and started to see 
that Ravana as though coming near Him.
Thereafter Hanuma, the best among Vanaras looking in all directions saw the best women of Ravana full 
of beauty and youth.
King of great fame, Ravana, together with those women with good appearance entered that garden 
resounded by animals and birds.
That king of Rakshasas who was intoxicated with wonderful ornaments, with pointed ears, son of 
Visravasa was like the moon together with stars, together with the best women seen by Hanuma. That great Vanara 
with great brilliance saw that Ravana with glory.
The son of the god of wind Vanara Hanuma of great brilliance thought thus "This long-armed one is 
Ravana", jumped down.
Thus Hanuma although of terrible energy was overshadowed by Ravana's brilliance and became rooted 
behind a group of leaves and was concealed.
That Ravana neared Seetha with black hair, charming limbs with well-knit breasts, with black 
corners of eyes, wishing to see Her.
Then, the demons there, approached Ravana and informed him that the city had been
besieged by Rama along with his monkeys.
Hearing that the city has been attacked, Ravana exhibiting his anger, doubly made
the necessary arrangements for the war and ascended his mansion.
That Ravana caught a glimpse of the city of Lanka, with its mountains, groves and
forests all being covered by innumerable troops of monkeys, waiting for war.
Seeing the earth made all brown with innumerable monkeys, Ravana in great perplexity
reflected: "How can they be exterminated?"
Having pondered for long, regaining his confidence and with his eyes widened by
surprise, Ravana gazed on Rama and his troops of monkeys.
Full of delight, Rama passed forward (on the back of a monkey) along with his army
and saw Lanka being guarded on all sides and thronged with demons.
Seeing that city of Lanka duly decorated with banners and flags, Rama remembered
Seetha with a distressed heart.
He said to himself, "Here is that daughter of Janaka, whose eyes resemble those of a
fawn, tormented with grief, emacitated, with a bare ground as her bed and suffering here on my
account."
Reflecting on Seetha being troubled, the virtuous Rama speedily issued a command to
the monkeys to destroy the enemies forthwith.
Hearing those words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, the monkeys vying with one
another filled the air with their roaring resembling those of lion.
"We shall tear asunder this Lanka with mountain-peaks or with fists alone." - thus
resolved all the monkey- generals.
Lifting up mountain peaks and huge rocks and plucking up various kinds of trees, the
monkey-generals stood prepared (for the attack).
In order to fulfill Rama's cherished desire, those troops, forming themselves into
columns, began to scale the heights of Lanka, while Ravana stood gazing.
Those monkeys, of golden hue with coppery countenance, fighting with Sala trees and
mountain-peaks, marched ahead towards the city of Lanka, ready as they were to lay down their lives
in Rama's service.
Those monkeys demolished innumerable defensive walls and arches with blows from
trees, mountain-tops and fists.
The monkeys filled the moats containing clear water with sands, mountain-tops,
grasses and logs of wood.
The commanders scaled the walls of Lanks, taking with them battalions of monkeys in
thousands, in crores and even hundreds of crores.
The monkeys stood tearing up the golden arches and breaking down the gates that
equaled the peak of Kailasa the mountainous abode of Shiva the Lord of Destruction.
The monkeys who resembled great elephants hurled themselves towards that Lanka,
springing, leaping and roaring.
The monkeys, who were able to change their form at will, shouting - "Victory to the
mighty Rama and the valiant Lakshmana!" "Victory of Sugreeva protected by Raghava!" and roaring,
rushed towards the defensive walls of Lanka.
Those monkey-generals Virabahu, Subahu, Nala and Panasa, having position on them.
Meanwhile, they formed an encampment of a multitude of military divisions there.
The mighty Kumuda, surrounded by a crore of monkeys, who behaved like conquerors,
stood besieging the eastern gate (while remaining stationed in north-east).
Surrounded by other monkeys, a monkey called Prasabha and the mighty armed Panasa
too up their position, in order to assist Kumuda himself.
The strong and valiant monkey, Shatabali accompanied by twenty crores of monkeys,
approached the southern gate (while remaining stationed in south-east) and stood there, to obstruct
the exit.
The mighty monkey named Sushena, the father of Tara (Vali's wife), going to the
western gate (while remaining stationed in the south-west) surrounded by crores and croes of
monkeys, stood besieging that gate.
Rama along with Lakshmana and Sugreeva the mighty lord of the monkeys, seeking the
northern gate (while remaining stationed in the north west) stood besieging that gate.
Accompanied by a crore of bears having terrific rage, Dhumra (brother of Jambavan,
the king of bears) of great prowess and the annihilator of enemies, took up his position by the
side of Rama.
Vibhishana of great energy with mace in hand, clad in defensive armour and
accompanied by his watchful ministers, took his position where the mighty Rama is stationed.
Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha and Gandhamadana, galloping on all sides, defended the
army of monkeys.
Ravana the lord of demons with his mind filled in anger, then commanded for the
decamping of the entire army immediately.
At this command coming from Ravana lips, a tremendous clamour arose among the
demons.
By beating with sticks of gold, the demons stirred up on every side, kettle drums
whose discs were white as the moon.
Hundreds and thousands of sonorous couches blared forth, blown with their cheeks
extended to the full, by the most ghastly demons.
With their handsome limbs equipped with couches, those rangers of night shone like
clouds bordered with lightning accompanied by rows of cranes.
The battalions rushed forth under Ravana's instructions like the rushing forth of
the ocean, which is swollen by the clouds, at the time of universal dissolution.
Then, from every side a clamour, arose from the army of monkeys, which filled Malaya
mountain with its ridges, plains and caves.
The sound of couches and drums made by the demons and the leouine roars of those
monkey- warriors re-echoed over the earth, sky and sea.
With the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of the horses, the clattering of the
chariot-wheels and the sounds of the foot-steps, the sound of the couches reechoed over the earth,
sky and sea.
In the meantime, a terrible struggle ensued between the demons and the monkeys, as
in the former times between celestials and demons.
Exhibiting their native prowess, the demons began to strike all the monkeys with
their flaming maces, spears, harpoons and axes.
Then, the gigantic monkeys swiftly struck those demons with trees, mountain-tops,
nails and teeth "Victorious is king Sugreeva" - thus arose a loud war-cry.
Then, some other terrifying demons on their part, shouting "Be winsome! Be
victorious!", proclaimed their own respective names. While some demons standing on walls hacked at
the monkeys standing on the ground (below) with hooks and harpoons.
The enraged monkeys, who wee standing on the ground, leapt into the air and dragged
down the demons stationed on the walls by seizing them with their arms.
That tumultuous combat between demons and monkeys transformed into a wonder, leaving
a mire of flesh and blood.Thereafter, the spies informed Ravana about Rama, with his unperturbable army,
having encamped on Suvela Mountain.
Hearing from the spies about the arrival of Rama, the exceedingly strong man, Ravana
became a little perturbed and spoke to Shardula as follows:
O, demon! Your complexion is not so as it should be. You look miserable too. I hope
that you have not fallen a victim to the enraged monkeys."
Thus questioned by Ravana, Shardula afflicted with fear, then sluggishly spoke the
following words to Ravana the tiger among demons:
"O, king! Those strong, bold and excellent monkeys protected by Rama are not capable
of being spied upon."
"They are not capable of being talked with and nothing can be found in interrogating
with them. The entire path is being protected by the monkeys looking like mountains."
"I was identified when that army was merely penetrated into (by me) and began to be
examined. I was seized forcibly by the demons (forming the retinue of Vibhishana), who investigated
me in various ways."
"I was beaten on all sides with knees, fists, teeth and palms by the enraged
monkeys. I was also paraded round in the midst of their army."
"Having been paraded all around thus, I was finally taken to the court of Rama. All
my limbs were bleeding and Rama. All my limbs were bleeding and I was trembling, with my senses
disturbed."
"While being plagued by the monkeys and asked for protection with joined palms, I
was saved fortunately by Rama, saying  stay!stay!'
"Rama has filled the sea with boulders and rocks, taking up his position at the
gates of Lanka and stands there, well-equipped with weapons."
"Having released me, Rama of great splendour arranged the army in the form of Garuda
(an eagle). He is encircled on all sides by the monkeys and is approaching towards Lanka."
"Before he reaches the ramparts, do one thing or the other quickly or give away
Seetha immediately or even offer him battle."
Having heard those words, Ravana the lord of demons reflected on it and thereafter
spoke the following significant words to Shardula.
"I will not give away Seetha even if the celestials or Gandharvas the celestial
musicians or the demons were to fight against me or even under danger from all beings."
After uttering the aforesaid words, the heroic Ravana again spoke as follows: "Has
the army been espied by you? Who are the valiant monkeys among them?"
"O, the virtuous gentle Shardula! What radiance do the monkeys, who are difficult to
be conquered possess of? what kind? Whose sons and grandsons are they? You tell me that
information."
"After knowing their strengths and weakness, I will decide in this matter
accordingly. Is it not necessary to count clearly those who are really yearning to fight the
battle?"
Hearing Ravana's words, Shardula the excellent spy then started to narrate these
words for Ravana's information:
"Certainly, king Sugreeva, the son of Riksharajasa, is difficult to be conquered in
battle. Here is the son of Gadgada, famously called as Jambavan."
"The other one is the son of the same Gadgada. Another one is the son of Brihaspati
the teacher of Indra the lord of celestials, called Kesari by whose son Hanuman the demons were
destroyed."
"O, king! Here is Sushena the son of Yama the Lord of Death who is valiant and
virtuous, as well as a monkey called Dadhimukha, the cool-minded, who is the son of moon."
"Sumukha, Durmukha and a monkey called Vegadarshi are surely the personifications of
death in the form of monkeys, created by Brahma, the Lord of creation."
"Here is Nila the army-general himself, the son of Agni the Lord of Fire. Here is
the son of Vayu the Lord of Wind well- known as Hanuman."
"The young Angada, Indra's grandson, the strong and invincible one, both the mighty
Mainda and Dvinda born of the two divinties of Ashvin* as well as Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha
and Gandhamadhana the five sons of Yama the God of Death all of them resembling Yama at the time of
dissolution of the world, the valiant ten crores of monkeys who are yearning for battle are all
here. I cannot venture to tell about the remaining glorious sons of god."
"This young man is Rama, Dasartha's son, who is well-built like a lion, by whom
Dushana ws killed as also Khara and Trishana.
"There is no one on earth who is equal in prowess to Rama, by whom Viradha was
killed as also Kabandha who was equal to Yama."
"No man on this earth is able to narrate the qualities of Rama, by whom all the
demons staying in Janasthana were killed."
"Here too is the virtuous Lakshamana, resembling the most excellent elephant among
elephants, in the path of whose arrows, even Indra the Lord of celestials himself could not
survive
"Sweta and Jyotirmukha, the sons of the sun-god, a monkey called Hemakuta, another
son of Varuna, Nila the son of Visvakarma the strong and the best of monkeys, as well as that
mighty and swift Durdhara the son of Vasus are all here."
"There is the prince of demons Vibhishana, your brother, who having secured the city
of Lanka (as a prospective gift from Rama) remains devoted to the good of Rama."
"Thus, I have described about the entire army of monkeys stationed on the Mount
Suvela. Now, it is for you to decide what remains to be done!"Hearing those words, which were truthful and coward less, as spoken by Sarana, the
king Ravana spoke to Sarana as follows:
"I do not give Seetha even if the celestials, celestial musicians or demons attack
me or even if there is a terror from all the worlds."
"O, gentle one! As you were harassed very much by the monkeys and hence fearful; you
are thingking of giving back Seetha now itself as good."
"Which enemy can defeat me in battle?" The illustrious Ravana, the lord of demons,
causing the world to cry, spoke harsh words as aforesaid and then from there ascended the roof of
his palace which was shining white like his snow and which was equal to the height his snow and
which was equal to the height of several palmyrah trees, with a desire to see the army of
monkeys.
Ravana, stupefied with anger, along with his spies, saw that ocean, the mountains
and the forests and beheld the entire land completely filled with monkeys.
Seeing that great army of monkeys, which was boundless and intolerable, the king
Ravana asked Sarana as follows:-
"Which monkeys are important among them? Who are valiant ones? Who are the very
strong ones? Who will stay in front at all places, with great energy?"
"To whom Sugreeva will hear? Who are the generals of the commanders of the
monkey-heads? What is the influence of the monkeys? O, Sarana! Tell me all."
Then, Sarana who knew the chiefs of monkeys, spoke the following words about the
chiefs of the monkeys i them, to the lord of demons who was enquiring about them.
"He, the valiant one, who holds his arms high, who tramples the earth under his feet
as he marches, whose face is turned towards Lanka, who in fury is knitting his brows very much, who
is resembling a mountain- peak in stature, who is like filaments of a louts in hue, who is excess
of anger continuously lashes out his tail and the swish of which is heard in ten regions, he is the
prince named Angada, anointed by Sugreeva the king of monkeys and is challenging you to the
battle."
"He, the valiant one, who holds his arms high, who tramples the earth under his feet
as he marches, whose face is turned towards Lnaka, who in fury is knitting his brows very much, who
is remsebling amountain- peak in stature, who is like filaments ofa louts in hue, who is excess of
anger continuously lashes out his tail and the swish of hwich is heard in ten regious, he is the
prince named Angada, anointed by Sugreeva the king of monkeys and is challenging you to the
battle."
"This Angada, a worthy son of Vali and always dear to Sugreeva, is coming forwards
for Rama's interests, as Varuna is to Indra's."
"It is all due to Angada's design that Seetha was found by Hanuman, who is a swift
monkey and a well-wisher of Rama."
"This valiant Angada, bringing along with him innumerable cheifs of monkeys, is
approaching to crush you, with the help of his own army."
"Surrounded by a large army, here stands the valiant Nala the creator of the bridge,
next to Angada the son of Vali, prepared for the battle."
"These excellent monkeys, numbering a thousand crores and eight lakhs, lodging in
sandalwood groves, yelling with a lion's roar and having stiffened their limbs, are knitting their
eye=brows raised in anger. These valiant monkeys, who are terrific and fierceful having a feroceous
zeal are going after Nala. Nala himself with his aforesaid army aspires to smash Lanka
forthwith."
"A monkey called Sweta of sivlver hue who is quick-witted and cleaver, of terricfic
prowess and a warrior renowned in the three worlds, has come to Sugreeva swiftly, dividing the army
of monkeys and brining great delight to the troops, he goes back at once."
"There was mountain called Ramya, on the banks of River Gomati. That mountain filled
with various kinds of trees was also called Samrochana. An army-chief, named Kumuda used to roam
around that mountainous region. He also used to rule that kingdom. He is the leader for lakhs of
monkeys. He has a very long hair-coppery, yellow, pale and white and hideous to cook upon- thrown
about on his tail is the intrepid and fierceful monkey called Kanda. He yearns to fight and boast
that he with destroy Lanka his forces."
"O, king! He who resembles a tawny lion with a long mane and who is looking at Lanka
attentively as though he wishes to consume it with his glasses, who dwells mostly on the mountains
of Krishna and Sahya of Vindhya range of pleasing aspect, is the General named Rambha. Three
thousand crores of excellent monkeys, who are formidable of impetuous valour and vigour, surround
him who is marching ahead and follow in his goot-sets to destroy Lanka."
"O, king! Look! The one who is yawning continuously and shaking his ears, he who
does not have fear of death, he who never retreats from a battle, but violently moves with rage,
who again sees obliquely, he who lashes out his tail and roars like a lion with great vigour, he
who constantly dwells on the lovely Salveya mountain, he is Sarabha by name, the commander of
monkeys with immense energy and devoid of fear."
"O, king! All his one lakh and forty thousand army-chiefs called Viharas* are
strong.
"The one who is like a great cloud, enveloping the space and who stays in teh middle
of monkey-warriors like Indra the god of celestials, the great voice of whose monkeys wishing for
battle is heard like the roll of drums, is the General named Panasa, who is always invincible in
battle. He dwells in Pariyatra, a mountain that is exceeded by none in height."
Troop-commanders numbering fifty lakhs commanding separate units attend obediently
to him, who is excellent among the Generals."
"He who is encamped with sixty lakhs monkeys as his army-strength on the sea-shore
like unto a second ocean is the commander called Vinata who resembles Dardura mountain (in size)
and is positioned there lending charm to the formidable army marching ahead and moves about,
drinking the water of River Vena, the foremost of all rivers."
"A monkey called krathana, keeping the courageous, strong monkeys and the
army-lieutenants in separate units, is inviting you for the battle."
"That resplendent monkey who for his part nourishes his body having the hue of a red
chalk and proud of his strength, stands facing you with anger despising all other monkeys."
"Seventy lakhs monkeys are attending on him. He himself wishes to crush the city of
Lanka with the help of his army."
"These commanders and commanders-in-chief are difficult to be conquered and their
number is hard to be counted. Their troops are divided into distinct units."On directing those eight ghastly demons Ravana is amused in his heart of hearts that he has accomplished 
a great feat. 
On continually musing upon Vaidehi Ravana is tormented with the arrows of Love-god, thereby to lay eyes 
on Seetha he post-hastily entered the beautiful palace. 
On entering the palace-chamber that supremo of demons beheld Seetha overwhelmed with ruefulness amongst 
demonesses. 
She whose visage is brimming over with tears, one browbeaten and downtrodden with the burden of bewail, 
one capsized like a boat that is about to capsize in an ocean spreadeagled with whirlwinds, and one 
alike an impala altogether swerved from its herd of impala yet hemmed in with dog-wolves, that nightwalker 
came nigh of such a Seetha whose face is downcast unwilling to see any, and to such a pitiable Seetha 
who is in the shackles of her sorrow, that supremo of demons compellingly started to show his palace 
which is similar to any paradisiacal palace. 
That paradisiacal mansion house of Decahedral Ravana is congestive with innumerable cupolaed skyscrapers, 
adored with thousands of females, frequented by diverse bevies of birds, and it comprised of numerous 
gemstones. The pillars are amazingly gilded with engraving of ivory, gilt, quartz, silvern linocuts, 
and they are even embossed with diamonds and with lapis gems, which are heart-pleasing for a look. The 
drumbeats of divine drums are echoing in entire palace, and its archways are adorned with the gildings 
of pure gold. 
Ravana walked up the wonderful golden staircase along with Seetha, and the rows of skyscrapers with 
windows that are ivoried and silvered and with window-blinds are seen from the windows of the landing 
on that flight of stairs, which are also ivoried and silvered windows with window-blinds, and all are 
amusing for sight. 
That Decahedral Ravana displayed the multiple stories of his own palace which is all over white-marbled 
and diamond encrusted to Maithili. 
Ravana continued to display the descendible wellsprings and leisure pools from which diverse flowers 
have sprung and overspread them, regardless of Seetha's languishing under her anguish. 
On flaunting his best palace in its entirety to Vaidehi that dirty-minded Ravana spoke this sentence 
to Seetha in order that she may be tempted on her own, lustily. 
"Oh, Seetha, ten crores of first-rated demons are there, furthermore, twenty-two crores of demons of 
ghastly exploits are there, thus all put together, three hundred twenty millions of demons are there 
in Lanka, omitting the weakish, oldish, youngish demons. For all of them I am the lord." Thus Ravana 
started his self-eulogy. 
"For every single work of mine a thousand servitors will rush in. Such as I am I pledge entire life 
of mine along with the suzerainty of this sovereign city-state Lanka to you, oh, broad-eyed lady, for 
you are loftier than my lives. 
"Oh, Seetha, you will become an empress for all of the those countless females of finest fabric amassed 
by me, oh, dear, if only you marry me. 
"You be keen on my amiable words and it will be apt of you to show compassion on me, for I have burning 
desire for you, and of what use is your thinking conversely about that long-lost Rama? 
"It is impossible to assail this Lanka even for Indra with all of the gods and demons, as an ocean roundly 
enshrouds this Lanka which is hundred-yojana-s witdthwise. 
"I behold none matchable to my vitality is existent among gods; among yaksha-s - no; among gandharva-s 
- no; among sages - no, nor anyone in any world. 
"What can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant Rama who is short-lived, for after 
all, he is a human with littlest vitality? 
"Oh, Seetha, you apotheosise me only for I am your seemliest husband, oh, jumpy lady, indeed, primeness 
has impermanence, thus here you be blithesome with me. 
"Oh, beautifully visaged lady, it is needless to have half a mind to see that Raghava, oh, Seetha, even 
if his wits chariot him what is his calibre to come thither crossing an un-crossable ocean? 
"It is impossible to knot the currents of cyclonic gusts in mid air, more so, it is impracticable to 
lay hold on the tongues of radiately irradiant fire. 
"Oh, benefactress of bliss, he who can lead you back with his valour, while you are being fended off 
by my mighty arms, him I do not envisage even in any one world of this threefold world. 
"You rule over this very great empire of Lanka as an empress of Lanka, while me and mine, also thus 
all gods like me who hitherto are under my rule, and all mobile and sessile entities of whom I am the 
ruler, they too will hereafter make ourselves useful as your royal stewards, if you marry me. 
"Wet with the waters of anointment you be elated and then delight me. By your damnable dwelling in forests 
bygone is your bad-luck that you misdealt in bygone times. And what dutiable good deed is to be done 
by you in marrying me, you do that now, and secure the fruits of that good deed here by marrying me. 

"Oh, Maithili, here all the garlands are divinely fragranced and the jewellery is topmost, you will 
dress up with them along with me should you become my wife. 
"Oh, well-waisted lady, just by my might I notched up an aircraft known as Pushpaka from my brother 
Kubera in a war with him, which is similar sun in its shine. 
"That aircraft is expansive and exhilarating, also its speed is on par with intuition, oh, Seetha, in 
that you can cheerfully fly about along with me, should you marry me. 
"Oh, lady with a comely countenance, your visage is lotus similar in its shine, besides being immaculate, 
fairish and eyeful, but oh, curvaceous lady, with such a mushily maudlin of such a face this palace 
of mine is unbright, thus marry me to brighten everything" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. 
While Ravana is speaking to her in this way that graceful lady Seetha veiled her moonier face with fringe 
of her sari, and stiflingly dispelled tears on that mooniest face behind her half-veil. 
To her who is disconcerted and whose anguish marred her brilliance and who is appearing as though pondering 
over the question of her submittal to Ravana, or otherwise, although she is meditating, to such a Seetha 
Ravana the nightwalker said these words. 
"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental 
to scriptural canons, oh, empress, what that is approaching you in the form of queen-hood is absolutely 
compatible with the tradition.
"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental 
to scriptural canons, what that is approaching you in the mode of queen-hood is ordained by gods and 
it is absolutely traditional. 
"Let these two feet of yours be massaged by my ten heads, do me favour readily, for I am your subordinate 
and servant. 
"I with a lustful hollow-heart spoke all these hollow words that are unbefitting to my stature, indeed, 
Ravana will never supplicate headlong to whosoever woman. 
That Decahedral Ravana on speaking thus to Maithili, who is the daughter of Janaka, deemed that 'she 
is mine,' as he has gone under the sway of the Terminator. Hearing of Indrajit's killing and having ascertained the news, Ravana's counsellors
reported the matter hurriedly to Ravana.
"O monarch! Your great majestic son has been killed by Lakshmana with the help of
Vibhishana, while we were witnessing the event in the battle-field."
"Your valiant son, who was unbeatable in combats and that hero who conquered Indra
the lord of celestials, having collided with valiant Lakshmana, has been killed. Having tormented
Lakshmana with his arrows, Indrajit departed to the highest world."
Hearing that news of formidable, harsh and terrific death of Indrajit his son in
battle, Ravana gave way to a protracted swoon.
Regaining his consciousness after a long time, the king Ravana, confounded as he was
with sorrow on account of his son's death and with his mind confused, lamented as follows depressed
as he was.
"Alas! My child, the chief of the army of demons, having extraordinary might! Having
conquered Indra, how have you been subjected to the power of Lakshmana now?"
"Certainly, when enraged, you would pierce with your arrows in battle, even the
all-destroying time in the form of Yama the Lord of Death and even the peaks of Mount Mandara. What
to tell about Lakshmana?"
"O the long armed one! Highly esteemed to me is the king Yama, son of sun-god, by
whom you have been subjected to the ravages of time today."
"This is the path for great warriors even among all the celestial hosts. That male
offspring who is killed for the cause of his lord, obtains heaven."
"Seeing Indrajit having been killed, all the hosts of celestials, the guardians of
the world and the great sages now can sleep comfortably and peacefully."
"Bereft of Indrajit alone, the entire earth with its forest appear to be wholly
alone to me. Nay, even the three worlds!"
"Now, I shall hear the hue and cry of the demon-maidens in the gynaecium, even as
one would hear the roar of a troop of female-elephants in a mountain cave."
"O destroyer of enemies! Where did you go leaving the rank of Prince Regent as also
Lanka, the demons, your mother and myself, your wives and all of us."
"O hero! The obsequies rights in my honour ought to have been done by you,
consequent upon my death in future. You are, however, following a reverse path."
"Deserting us without taking away my tormentation, while Sugreeva, lakshmana and
Rama are still alive, where have you gone?"
A huge rage enveloped Ravana, the king of demons, born of his son's death, while he
was feeling distressed through grief as aforesaid.
The anguishes occasioned by the death of his son, flared up further for him, who by
his very nature, was wrathful, as rays of the sun flare up the blazing sun in summer.
With his eye brows joined together on his forehead, he shone brightly like an ocean,
at the time of the dissolution of the world, with crocodiles and giant waves.
While he was yawning with anger; a fire with smoke, as though clearly burning, broke
out from his mouth, as it did from the month of Vritra (in the former days).
Afflicted with the grief of his son's killing, that valiant Ravana got wrapped up in
wrath and pondering with his mind, craved for the killing of Seetha.
The dreadful eyes of that Ravana, which were red in colour by their very nature and
were red even by the fire of his wrath, looked glittering.
That naturally terrific form of Ravana, filled with the fire of his wrath, became
difficult to be approached, like the form of enraged Rudra the god of destruction.
Drops of tears fell down from his enraged eyes, as drops of oil with flames fall
down from blazing lamps.
The sound of his teeth, produced from the friction of his teeth as he ground them,
were heard like the noise of a large machine being bragged by the demons.
Trembling with fear, the demons hid themselves, in whichever quarter to which he
directed his look, enraged as he was, like the fire of universal dissolution.
Demons could not go towards Ravana, who was looking at all the four quarters, like
the enraged Yama the god of Death, who wants to devour both the mobile and the immobile
creatures.
Desirous of posting the demons to the battle-field, Ravana the king of demons, who
was very much enraged, then spoke as follows, in their midst:
"Brahma the lord of creation was gratified by me, by performing a stupendous
austerity for thousands of years, at the conclusion of those austerities."
"As a consequence of that austerity alone and by the grace of Brahma the lord of
creation, there was never a fear for me either from the demons or from the celestials."
"In the course of combats with the gods and demons, the armour gifted to me by
Brahma, the lord of creation, which is as brilliant as the sun, could not be mutilated by those who
held the thunderbolt in their fists."
"Who will, be it Indra himself, dare to attack me on the battle-field now, when
mounted on chariot on this field of battle, and duly wearing the aforesaid armour?"
"Let that large bow of mine, which was given at that time to me along with arrows by
the gracious Brahma the lord of creation, on the occasion of my combat between gods and demons, be
taken out today to the accompaniment of a band of musical instruments, for the purpose of killing
Rama and Lakshmana in the great battle."
That cruel Ravana, afflicted as he was with grief at the killing of his son, was
subjected to anger and deeply pondering with his mind, decided kill Seetha.
Looking fixedly with blood-red eyes on all those demons, who were making miserable
sounds, that very awful Ravana for his part, who had assumed a terrible appearance, though feeling
distressed, spoke to them as follows:
"In order to hoodwink the monkeys, something which had been killed there, was shown,
by taking recourse to conjuring tricks, as Seetha, by my child (Indrajit)"
"I shall make that hoax into a hard reality, which is pleasing to me. I shall
destroy Seetha, who is devoted to Rama, a bad warrior". Thus speaking to his counsellors, he
swiftly drew his sword.
The enraged Ravana, who was very much agitated in mind because of the grief for his
son's death, springing up suddenly and taking his excellent sword, having the dazzle of a clear
sky, sallied forth from the assembly hall along with his ministers swiftly and quickly to the place
where Seetha was.
Seeing Ravana going, his followers emitted a lion's roar. Seeing the enraged Ravana
and embracing each other, they spoke as follows:
"Both those brothers (Rama and Lakshmana), on seeing him now in fury, will get
perturbed. Indeed even the four guardians of the world had been frightened by him, who was in fury.
Many other enemies were also frightened by him in various battles."
"Fetching precious things existing in all the three worlds, Ravana enjoys them. No
one on the earth is equal to him in strength and prowess."
While those demons were thus talking, Ravana who was excited with fury, rushed
towards Seetha, who was present in the Ashoka grove.
Though being kept back by his companions whose minds were set on his welfare, Ravana
who was very much enraged, rushed like Mars, in the sky, which would rush towards the
constellation, Rohini in fury.
The faultless Seetha for her part, who was being guarded by female demons, saw the
enraged Ravana who was bearing an excellent sword.
Seetha was perturbed in seeing him, bearing sword and who was not going back
eventhough being kept back in many ways by his friends.
Filled with sorrow and lamenting, Seetha said to herself as follows: "From the
manner in which this fellow himself is rushing towards me in fury, I fear the evil-minded demon is
going to kill me, to make me husband-less, even though I have a husband".
"He incited me several times, devoted as I am to my husband, saying 'Be my
consort!'. He was refused firmly by me. Having been evidently afflicted with despair on my refusing
to wait upon him, he is surely intent to kill me, filled as he was with anger and infatuation."
"Otherwise, that vulgar demon might have killed those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana,
the foremost of men, today in battle, because of me."
"Here, I just heard a terrific great noise of a multitude of demons, who have been
jubilant and roaring about a pleasant happening."
"Alas! Woe is me, if that destruction of the two princes was brought about because
of me. Otherwise, the terrific demon of a sinful resolve, having not been able to kill Rama and
Lakshmana, is going to kill, me, because of the grief over his son's death."
"Those words of Hanuma were not acted upon by me, having a low mind. If I left on
that day on his back, though not won back by my husband, I would not have grieved like this today,
as I should be resting on the lap of my husband (in that case)."
"I think that the heart of that Kausalya will get burst, when the lady, who had only
one son, hears of her son having been killed in battle."
"While lamenting, Kausalya will vividly recall about the birth, childhood, youth,
the righteous acts and the handsome form of the great-souled Rama."
"Having observed a ceremony in honour of her deceased son and getting despondent and
unconscious, Kausalya will surely enter the flame or be drowned in water."
"Woe be to the unfaithful hunch-back Manthara, of sinful resolve, on whose
consequence, Kausalya will get this grief."
Seeing Seetha miserably weeping in that manner like Rohini (the deity presiding over
a constellation of this name), fallen under the sway of the planet Mars, when away of the moon-god
(her husband), a minister called Suparshva, a good-natured, upright and highly intelligent demon,
even though restrained by other ministers, spoke the following words Ravana, the foremost of
demons:
"O Ravana, the younger brother of Kubera himself! How do you wish to kill Seetha,
abandoning your righteousness, in a bout of anger?"
"O valiant king of demons! Why are you thinking of destroying a lady, ever since you
completed the vow of celibacy essential for a study of the Vedic lore and were devoted to your own
duty?"
"O king! Behold at Seetha, endowed, as she is, with beauty. Together with us,
release your anger, in battle, on Rama alone."
"Making yourself ready today itself, the fourteenth day of the dark half of this
month, you along with the armies, sally forth tomorrow, the moonless day, to victory."
"As a valiant and shrewd chariot-warrior, fighting with a sword, in the foremost of
your chariots, you can fetch Seetha by killing Rama, the son of Dasaratha."
Accepting that advice, endowed with justice, tendered by a friend, the evil-minded
Ravana went to his palace. Thereafter, that valiant Ravana, along with his friends, again went to
his assembly hall from there.Ravana for his part heard the mournful and plaintive cry of the afflicted
female-demons in every house at Lanka.
Sighing for a long time and remaining engrossed in reflection for a while, that
Ravana was very much enraged and assumed a frightful appearance.
Nipping his lips with his teeth, his eyes becoming blood-red with anger, and his
sight becoming difficult to endure even for the demons, Ravana looked like the augmented fire of
dissolution.
Ravana, in words indistinct with anger as though consuming them with his glance,
ordered the demons, standing there near him, viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demon
(as follows): "Tell the armies asking them to start immediately, as per my command."
Hearing that command of Ravana, those demons were tormented with fear and enjoined
those armies of demons, who felt unagitated, in accordance with the orders of the king.
Saying, 'so it be', all those demons of terrible aspect, praying for the blessing of
the Almighty for averting evil, sallied forth, with their faces turned towards the
battle-field.
Paying reverence to Ravana according to the rules of propriety, all those great
car-warriors stood with joined palms, wishing victory to their lord.
Laughing heartily, Ravana then, stupefied as he was with anger, spoke to those
demons viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demons as follows:
"Today, I will send Rama and Lakshmana to the abode of Death, with my arrows looking
similar to the sun at the time of dissolution of the Universe."
"By killing the enemies now, I will take vengeance for Khara, Kumbhakarna, Prahasta
and Indrajit."
"The sky overcast by my arrows, like clouds, will not be distinctly seen. Neither
the quarters, nor the heaven, nor the seas will come to view."
"With a multitude of plumed arrows joined with my bow, I will kill, by turns, the
troops of monkey-chiefs today."
"By mounting on a chariot, having a speed equal to that of wind, I will destroy
today the armies of monkeys, with waves of arrows arising out of the ocean of my bow.
"Like an elephant, today I will destroy ponds in the form of troops of monkeys
shining like the filaments of lotus, with their faces resembling full-blown lotuses."
"With their faces transfixed with arrows, the monkey-leaders, lying on the
battle-field today will adorn the earth as with lotuses together with the stalks."
"With each arrow released in battle today, I shall tear one hundred full of monkeys,
the most furious of their troop, fighting with trees."
"By killing the enemy today, I shall wipe off the tears of those demons, who lost
their brothers and sons."
"With the monkeys pierced with my arrows, lying scattered in the battle-field and
bereft of their lives today, I shall cover the earth so fully, that it would be possible to see its
surface only with effort."
"Today, I shall satiate the crows, vultures and all those other creatures which eat
the flesh, with the flesh of enemies, struck by my arrows."
"Arrange my chariot quickly. Bring my bow swiftly. Let all the remaining demons
here, follow me to the combat."
Hearing that command of Ravana, Mahaparshva ordered the army-chiefs, standing there,
as follows: "let the army be made ready quickly."
Going around the city of Lanka, the army-chiefs for their part, with quick
resolution, joined hand in hand and hastened the demons in every house to set out for the
battle.
The demons, of terrible aspect and having awful faces, then roaring, with their arms
equipped with various weapons viz. swords, sharp-edged darts, pikes, maces, clubs, plough-like
weapons, sharp-edged javelins, huge Kutas and Mudgara, staffs, discuses of every kind, sharpened
axes, slings for throwing stones, stones or cylindrical wooden pieces with iron pikes and other
excellent weapons, rushed out within a moment.
Then, as per the orders of Ravana, the army-commander hurriedly brought a chariot,
moving swiftly, along with a charioteer and yoked with eight horses. Thereupon, the awful Ravana
mounted that chariot, shining with his own splendour.
Then, surrounded by several demons, Ravana sallied forth quickly, as though he was
cracking the earth with a profundity of his strength.
Thereupon, a great noise emanated on all sides from tabors, drums, Kettle-drums and
counches along with the clamour of the demons.
A clamour was heard, saying "There comes the ruler of demons, the abductor of
Seetha, the destroyer of Brahmanas, the enemy of gods, notorious for his bad conduct, accompanied
by his canopy and pair of whisks, to fight with Rama, the foremost among the Raghu dynasty."
By that huge sound, the earth trembled. Hearing that sound suddenly, the monkeys ran
away in fear.
The long-armed Ravana, for his part, with extra-ordinary energy, surrounded by his
ministers, turned up for victory in quest of victory.
Mahaparshva and Mahodara as also Virupaksha, who was difficult to overpower, as
order by Ravana, then ascended their chariots.
Those demons, roaring elatedly, as though cracking the earth, and emitting an awfull
uproar, sallied forth, longing for victory.
Then, the powerful Ravana, resembling the all-destroying Time in the form of Yama,
along with his army-troops of demons, set out for the battle with his raised bow.
Then, that Ravana, the great chariot-warrior, ascending his chariot driven by swift
horses, sallied forth to the gate, where Rama and Lakshmana were.
Then, the sun lost its radiance. The quarters too were enveloped in darkness. The
birds emitted fearful notes. The earth too trembled violently.
The cloud rained blood. The horses stumbled. A vulture descended on the top of the
ensign. Jackals emitted sinister howls.
His left eye too throbbed. His left arm trembled. He became pale-faced. His voice
was a little lowered.
When Ravana the demon was sallying forth for the battle, the following evil
phenomena, predicting his death, appeared in the battle-field.
A meteor with a sound similar to a thunder, fell down from the sky. Ill-omened
vultures together with crows cried out aloud.
Ignoring these dreadful bad omens due to his ignorance, Ravana marched forward for
the purpose of the massacre in battle, driven as he was by fate.
On hearing the sound of the chariot of those mighty demons, that army of monkeys too
returned for the fight.
A tumultuous battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were fond of
victory and summoning each other for combat with rage.
Thereupon, the enraged Ravana, with his arrows decked with that army of monkeys.
Some monkeys had their heads chopped off by Ravana. Some had their hearts pierced.
Some were made deprived of their ears.
Some were struck down breathless. Some were torn in their ribs. Some had their
skulls smashed. Some were deprived of their eyes.
Whichever side Ravana was coming in his chariot on the battle-field, his eyes
rolling in anger, those monkey-warriors, on that side, could not with stand the rapidity of his
arrows.Hearing those words of Lakshmana, that valiant Rama, the annihilator of his enemies,
taking hold of his bow, fixed an arrow on the bow-string.
In the forefront of battle, Rama released terrific arrows towards Ravana. Then,
occupying another chariot, Ravana the king of demons rushed towards Rama, even as Rahu the
seizer-demon rushes towards the sun.
Ravana for his part, standing in his chariot struck Rama with thunderbolt-like
arrows, as a cloud strikes gushes of rain on a huge mountain.
With an attentive mind, Rama showered golden decked arrows, looking like blazing
flames of fire, on Ravana in the battle-field.
The gods, celestial musicians and kinnaras the mythical beings thought that the
battle was not equal between Rama standing on the ground and Ravana fighting from a chariot.
Hearing their nectar-like words, the illustrious Indra, the chief f celestials then
called Matali and spoke as follows:
"Go quickly with my chariot to Rama, who is standing on the earth. After reaching
the earth, invite him to take his seat in the chariot and carry out a great service to the
gods."
Hearing the words of Indra, Matali, the charioteer of Indra, offering salutation to
him by bowing his head, spoke then the following words:
"O Indra! Providing with green horses the excellent chariot, I will proceed then
immediately and perform the duty of a charioteer to Rama."
Then came the glorious and excellent chariot of Indra, having variegated body decked
in gold, which was fitted with hundreds of tiny bells, with its pole of cat's eye gems shone like
the morning sun, yoked to excellent green horses, having golden chaplets on their heads, having
white whisks, covered with nets of gold, shining like the sun and bearing a flag-staff raised on a
golden bamboo. Ascending the chariot, as enjoined by Indra and descending from paradise, Matali
approached Rama.
Then Matali, the charioteer of Indra, along with a whip in his hand, stayed in the
chariot itself and joining his palms in salutation, spoke the following words to Rama.
"Indra has sent this chariot to you for your victory, O the mighty and the glorious
Rama, the destroyer of adversaries!"
"Here is the great bow belonging to Indra, an armour shining as fire, some arrows as
bright as sun and a stainless auspicious spear."
"O heroic king! Mounting this chariot with me as a charioteer, kill Ravana the king,
as earlier Indra the lord of celestials killed the demons."
Duly circumambulating that chariot (as a mark of respect) and offering his
salutation, when thus spoken by Matali, Rama then ascended the chariot, causing the three worlds to
shine forth with his splendour.
Then ensued a tumultuous and thrilling battle, between the great armed Rama and
Ravana, the demon.
That Rama, who was skilled in the use of great missiles, struck the missile presided
over by Gandharvas and the missile presided over by gods, by means of missiles of the same
type.
Ravana, the king of demons was very much enraged and again released another
extra-ordinarily terrific missile presided over by demons.
Those arrows, decked with gold, discharged from Ravana's bow, turning as they were
into highly poisonous snakes and rolled towards Rama.
With flaming mouths wide open and vomiting blazing fire, those dreadful snake-like
arrows dashed towards Rama alone.
All the quarters stood covered by highly poisonous serpents, whose impact was as
hard as that of Vasuki (the king of serpents), with the flaming coils. Even the corners between the
quarters stood enveloped by them.
Seeing those serpents rushing towards him in the battle-field, Rama released the
terrific and dangerous missile presided over by Garuda the eagle (an enemy of serpents).
With golden shafts which shone like flames, discharged by Rama's bow turning into
golden eagles (the enemies of serpents) those arrows flew all around.
Those arrows of Rama, which can assume any form at will, appeared in the form of
eagles and destroyed all those arrows, which flew with a great speed in the form of snakes.
Enraged on his missile having been frustrated by Rama, Ravana streamed forth
terrific showers of arrows on Rama.
Tormenting Rama of unwearied action with thousand arrows, Ravana then pierced Matali
with a multitude of arrows.
Targeting with only one arrow, Ravana tore off the flag-staff. Striking down the
golden flag-staff from the top of the chariot down to the seat of the chariot, Ravana struck even
Indra's horses with a multitude of arrows.
Seeing Rama afflicted, the gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Charanas the
celestials bards along with the demons, as also Siddhas the demi-gods and the great sages felt
dejected. Seeing the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by Rahu in the shape of Ravana, the
monkey-chiefs too, along with Vibhishana, felt perturbed.
Seeing thus the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by the planet Rahu in the shape
of Ravana, the planet Mercury stood, assailing the constellation Rohini presided over by the god
Prajapati (the lord of creation), the beloved of the moon the heavenly body and spelling disaster
to all created beings.
Blazing as it were in fury, the ocean rose high at that time, as though it was going
to touch the sun, its mist-wreathed waves moving to-and-fro.
The sun, looking ashy in colour assuming a piercing aspect, and its rays grown
exhilarated, appeared in a headless trunk in its lap and united with a comet.
The planet Mars stood assailing in the sky, the constellation Vishakha, presided
over by the gods Indra and Agni (the god of fire), which is adorned by the kings of Kosala.
That Ravana, having ten faces and twenty arms, holding a bow tightly in his hands,
looked like Mount Mainaka.
Being overwhelmed by Ravana the demon in the battle-front, Rama could not fit his
arrows to his bow.
The enraged Rama, knitting his eye-brows and with his eyes turned slightly
blood-red, was provoked to fierce anger, as though he would burn out the demons.
Seeing the face of the sagacious Rama getting provoked of anger, all the living
beings got frightened. The earth too began to tremble.
The mountain, with lions, tigers and swaying trees, was trembled. Even the ocean,
the lord of rivers, became agitated.
Dense clouds, emitting harsh sounds and assuming a stern aspect, roamed all over in
the sky, thundering.
Seeing the very much enraged Rama and also the terrific portents, all the living
beings were frightened. Fear seized Ravana too.
Seated in their aerial cars, gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, great Nagas
(semi divine beings having the face of a man and the tail of a serpent), the sages, demons, giants
and those eagles remaining in the air, saw then the battle of two heroes, fighting steadily with
various dreadful weapons and looking like the final dissolution of the world.
Getting rejoiced on observing that great battle, all the gods and demons who had
come to witness the conflict at that time, responded:
The demons who reached there cried out to Ravana, "Be victorious!". Those gods
called to Rama saying again and again: "Be you victorious!".
In the meantime, that evil-minded Ravana, who caused enemies to cry, stroking with
anger a great weapon wishing to strike Rama, took hold off with fury, a spike, which was powerful
as a thunderbolt, which made a loud noise (when hurled at a target), capable of exterminating all
enemies, resembling the mountain-peaks, which with its sharp points dreadful to conceive and to
behold, resembling a smoke-crested mass of fire blazing at the end of the world-cycle, exceedingly
furious, which was difficult to approach even for Death, which was unassailable, which was a terror
for all beings, capable as it was of tearing and splitting them and blazing as it was.
That valiant Ravana, surrounded by warriors of demons in battle, was very much
enraged and took hold of that spear at its middle.
With blood-red eyes in anger, Ravana with his collossal body, duly raising the spear
and bringing rejoice to his own army, roared terribly in battle.
The terrific noise made by Ravana then trembled the earth, the sky, the four
quarters and the angles of the compass
By that roar of that evil-minded Ravana of a collossal body, all the living beings
were frightened. The ocean too got agitated.
Taking hold of that large spear, that Ravana of great prowess, emitting a very loud
roar, spoke the following harsh words to Rama:
"Raised in fury by me, O Rama! This spear with the power of a thunder-bolt, will
take away surely your life along with the life of your bother, your help-mate."
"Killing you with my strength now, I, who always commend war-fare, will make you
level with the valiant demons, who have been killed in the battle-front."
"Wait, I will kill you with the spear now, O Rama!" Saying so, that demon hurled
that spear.
That spear, wreathed as it was in a circle of lightning, provided as it was with
eight bells and making a loud noise, released from Ravana's hand, splashed, as it went into tehs
sky.
Seeing that blazing spear of terrible appearance, the valiant Rama who was born in
Raghu dynasty, having stretched his bow, released the arrows.
With streams of arrows, Rama warded off that spear, which was rushing upon him, as
with streams of water, Indra the lord of celestials warded off the fire shooting up at the time of
dissolution of the world.
That large spear of Ravana consumed those arrows coming forth from Rama's bow, as
fire would consume the moths.
Seeing those arrows smashed by coming into contact with the spear and reduced to
ashes even while positioned in the sky, Rama was seized with fury.
That Rama, the delight of Raghus, was quite enraged and took hold of that spear
brought by Matali the charioteer, as desired by Indra the lord of celestials.
That spear, lifted up by the powerful Rama, which was rendered resonated by the
bells, began to blaze like a blazing meteor at the time of the dissolution of the world.
That spear, hurled by Rama, fell on that Ravana's spear. Torn down by Rama's spear,
the large spear of Ravana fell on the ground, with its lustre extinguished.
With terrific arrows of high speed, with their shafts made of reeds, going straight
to their target, Rama pierced the exceedingly fleet horses of Ravana.
With his sharp arrows, Rama then pierced the chest-region of Ravana. He also struck,
quite deliberately, the forehead of Ravana with three arrows.
With all his limbs torn down by arrows and with blood flowing from his limbs, that
Ravana in the midst of demons, shone like a blooming Ashoka tree in the midst of a multitude of
trees.
With his limbs severely injured by Rama's arrows and with his body bathed in blood,
that Ravana felt exhausted in the middle of a multitude of demons and gave went to a violent anger
at that time.Ravana listening to Seetha's words which were harsh thereafter replied to Seetha's unpleasant words 
which are seen to be pleasant.
"In whatever way gentle language is used to women in that way they will be under control. In whatever 
the way men speak dear words, in that way, they will be rejected."
"In your matter desire which has risen is subduing my anger like horses running obtain a 
bad path being subdued by a good charioteer."
"Desire of men is unfavorable. In which man's desire is tied up, in that man there is compassion 
and fondness."
"O one with a beautiful face! For this reason, although you are suitable to be killed and suitable 
to be humiliated, interested in Rama who is in sham exile, I am not killing you."
"O Seetha! Here whatever harsh words you are speaking about me, because of those words, you are 
suitable to be slayed."
The king of ogres Ravana speaking thus to Seetha, full of anger and fury spoke a subsequent word 
to Seetha.
"O Seetha with the best complexion! Whatever limit has been made by me to you, those two months are 
protectable to me. Thereafter ascend my bed."
"Above two months you not desiring me as husband will be killed in my kitchen for my breakfast."
Seeing Seetha being frightened by Ravana those Deva and Gandharva maidens grieved with troubled 
eyes.
Some in the way of lips and like manner some others with faces and eyes consoled that Seetha 
frightened by that ogre.
Consoled by them Seetha proud of virtuous conduct spoke words beneficial to self to the king of 
ogres Ravana.
"Whoever prevents you from these actions which are blameable, such a person interested in your 
welfare there is none. This is definite."
"In all the three worlds except you who even by heart will desire me who am the wife of virtuous 
Rama like Sachi the wife of Indra."
"O vile ogre! Whatever sinful word you spoke to me who is the wife of the great resplendent Rama, 
from that word where will you go to be released?"
"Like an elephant in a rut and a hare at war in the forest, in the same way, O vile one! Rama is like 
an elephant and you are said to be like a hare."
"Such you are not shameful abusing the lord of Ikshvaku dynasty Rama. You are not getting Rama's 
matter so much."
"O ignoble one! your these eyes which are cruel, crooked, which are black and reddish brown, which 
are seeing me, for what reason are they not falling."
"Thus speaking about me who am the wife of virtuous Rama and the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha how 
your tongue did not fall off."
"O Ravana! Although you are suited to be burnt into ashes, not having the mandate of Rama and preserving 
austerity, I am not reducing you into ashes with my glory."
"Wise Rama's I am not capable of being abducted by you. This act has been made for your slaying. 
In this, there is no doubt."
"By you who is strong, brother of Kubera possessed of the army, removing Rama for what reason abduction 
of wife has been done."
King of rakshasas Ravana listening to Seetha's words turned around his cruel eyes and saw Seetha.
Ravana was qual to a black cloud, with big shoulders and neck with the strength and gait of a lion, 
glorious with the radiant tip of tongue and eyes.
He was tall with a moving front portion of the crown, with excellent garlands and anointments, wearing 
red garlands and clothes, with ornaments made of refined gold.
Like Mount Mandara tied by Vasuki for producing nectar, Ravana was well tied by a black big thread.
Equalling a mountain the king of ogres shone with those perfect shoulders like Mount Mandara with 
its peaks.
With the color of just risen sun, decorated by earrings, he was like a mountain with Ashoka trees 
with red flowers and shoots.
Equalling a Kalpavriksha he was like the embodiment of spring season. Like a funeral mound in a 
grave-yard was horrible even though decorated.
With red eyes due to anger Ravana was looking at Seetha sighing like a serpant and spoke to Seetha.
O follower of Rama possessing bad conduct, without wealth! Now I will destroy you like the sun destroying 
morning twilight with light.
The king Ravana who causes enemies to cry thus speaking to Seetha, thereafter orders all ogre 
women with horrible appearances.
Ravana ordered one with a single eye, one with a single ear one with ears as covering, one 
with cow's wars, one with the ears of an elephant, one with dangling ears, one without ears, and one with the feet 
of an elephant and one with the feet of a horse, one with the feet of a cow, one with hair over feet, one with a single 
eye and one with a single foot, one with big feet, one without feet, one with a big head and neck, one with big 
breasts and stomach, and one with a big mouth and eyes, one with a long tongue, one without tongue, one without 
nose, one with the face of a lion, one with the face of a cow, one with the face of a pig.
"O ogres! How the daughter of Janaka, Seetha becomes under my control quickly, thus all of you 
together do that task."
"With hostile and favorable tasks, with kind words, with gifts and dividing words and exertion 
of punishment, bring Seetha under my possession."
Ravana thus ordered again and again with a mind full of lust and anger frightened Seetha.
Thereafter an ogre named Dhanyamalini quickly neared Ravana, embraced him, and spoke these words.
"O king! Sport with me. O lord of ogres! Of what use to you is this Seetha who is colorless and 
a wretched human."
"O king! Lord Brahma did not assign to Her wonderful best luxuries earned by the might of your 
arms. This is definite."
"The body of one who desires a woman without desire suffers pain. Good happiness will occur to 
one who loves a woman who desires him."
Thus spoken to by that ogre that Ravana who was strong equalling a cloud, thereafter being taken 
away turned back laughing."
That Ravana departing was as though shaking the earth and entered his house with the luster of 
blazing sun shine.
Deva and Gandharva maidens and Naga maidens surrounding Ravana in all directions entered the best 
among houses.
That Ravana frightened Seetha who was steadfastly intent on virtue and who was shaking, leaving 
Seetha, infatuated with love, entered his own house which was shining.That sinful Ravana, infatuated by his desire for Seetha, became emaciated by his
sinful action and by his despising of well-disposed people like Vibhishana.
Though the occasion for war was lacking Ravana thought of consulting with his
ministers and well-wishers then to be a fit time.
Approaching a great chariot, covered by a golden net, adorned with gems and corals
and yoked with trained horses, Ravana mounted on it.
Ravana the excellent among demons ascended that most beautiful chariot, with a
rattling sound resembling the rumbling of a large cloud and then proceeded towards the
assembly-hall.Warriors holding swords and shield as well as demons wearing all types of weapons,
marched in front of Ravana.
Demons wearing all types of unusual dresses and adoring various kinds of jewellery
then marched, duly surrounding him from sides and even behind.
Great chariot-warriors in chariots, on excellent elephants in rut and horses
supportively coming in different gaits, rushed after Ravana quickly.
Some had maces and iron bars in their hands. Some had javelins and iron clubs. Some
were holding axes. Some others had darts in their hands.
As Ravana was proceeding to the assembly-hall, loud blare of thousands of trumpets
along with tumultuous noise of conches were produced.
That excellently great chariot, making noise of the sound of its wheels, soon
entered the beautiful royal high-way.
The spotlessly white umbrella, held on Ravana's head, shone like a full-moon.
On his left and right sides, two fans of yak's tails with crystal handles and golden
fringes were shining.
All those demons standing on ground offered their salutation by bending their heads
and joining their palms to his the best of demons, mounted on the chariot.
Ravana the harasser of enemies, possessing great splendor, while being praised by
demons through cheers of victory, approached that organized assembly.
Ravana with great splendour, with his body shining brightly, entered that assembly
hall, which was paved with gold and silver, whose interior was wrought with pure crystal, carpeted
with skins of deer, guarded by six hundred evil spirits, ever shining and well-constructed by
Visvakarma.
Ravana, that hall, occupied a big and excellent throne embedded with jewels (cat's
eye gems), covered with skin of deer called Priyaka and furnished with pillows.
Thereafter Ravana, as a king, ordered his messengers, who were moving fast as
follows: "There is a gigantic work before us. I know what the enemies are doing. Therefore, bring
all the demons here quickly."
Hearing those words, the messenger impelled the demons staying in entertainment
places, in bedrooms or in gardens and went without fear to every house in Lanka.
Some of the demons mounted beautiful chariots; some mounted wild and strong horses
and some mounted on elephants. Some others went on foot.
That city, extremely crowded with chariots elephants and horses rushing fast
together, appeared like birds rushing fast in the sky.
Parking horses, elephants and various kinds vehicles like chariots, they entered by
foot the assembly-hall as a mountain-cave is entered by lions.
Touching the feet of the king and greeted in turn by the king, some sat down on
seats, some others on mats (of Kusa grass) and others on the ground.
Congregating in the assembly hall at the king's command, those demons took their
position round Ravana the king of demons, each according to their rank.
Ministers who were scholars well versed in deciding action those endowed with good
qualities, those who were all-knowing, king's ministers who could perceive things by their power of
intellect and many warriors in hundreds, gathered according to their importance in that assembly
hall, wrapped with gold, for providing felicity in all actions.
The high-souled and illustrious VibhiShana ascended an excellent auspicious and
spacious chariot yoked with good horses with its various parts decked in gold and drove towards the
assembly-hall of Ravana his elder brother.
Then, that younger brother Vibhishana told Ravana his name and offered salutation to
the feet. Suka and Prahasta followed suit. Ravana gave them suitable seats separately.
The aroma of the best aloe and sandal paste painted on the persons as also of
garlands worn round the necks of those demons duly adorned with ornaments of gold and gems and
attired in excellent clothes diffused all round in the assembly-hall.
The assembled persons there did not yell loudly. None uttered untruth or even talked
vociferously. All of them were ready for action and were endowed with terrible energy. All of them
sat, perceiving their lord's face.
In that assembly, that Ravana, full of mind, shone with brilliance among the
assemblage of those demons possessing great strength, like Devendra (the Lord of heaven) amidst
Vasus (a class of gods)While Prahasta the Army chief of demons was slain in the battle by Nila the foremost
among the monkeys, Ravana's army possessing terrible arms took to flight with the speed of a
tide.
The demons went and told Ravana that Prahasta the Army chief had been killed by Nila
the son of Fire-god. Hearing those words of the demons, Ravana was possessed of anger.
Hearing that Prahasta had perished in the fight, Ravana was afflicted with anger and
his heart filled with grief and he addressed the foremost of his leaders as Indra the Lord of
celestials to the leaders of the celestial troops (as follows):
"That enemy is not to be despised; under whose blows the destroyer of Indra's host
the leader of my army with his followers and elephants fell."
"I myself shall go to that wonderful battle-front without hesitation in order to
destroy the enemies and to gain victory."
"As a forest is consumed by blazing fires, so shall I scorch that army of monkeys
now along with Lakshmana and Rama with a multitude of arrows. Today, I shall satiate the earth with
the blood of the monkeys."
Speaking thus, Ravana the enemy of the Lord of celestials ascended his chariot which
shone like a flame and was yoked to a team of excellent horses with its brilliance of an effulgent
body.
Ravana the best among the kings of demons sallied forth with the sound of couches,
kettle-drums, cymbals, clapping of hands and leonine roars and well-acclaimed by agreeable
encomiums.
That Ravana along with the flesh-eating demons whose forms resembled mountains and
clouds and whose glances flashed like torches shone like Rudra the Lord of Immortals surrounded by
genii.
Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary energy, issuing all at once from the city,
observed a ferocious army of monkeys with trees and rocks in their hands, ready for combat and
roaring like a vast ocean and a mass of thunder-clouds.
Seeing that army of demons who were excessively furious, Rama whose arms resembled
great serpents, accompanied by his forces and having great fortune, spoke to Vibhishana the best
among the wielders of weapons (as follows):
"Who is in command of this army, furnished with every kind of standard, banner and
canopy, armed with javelins, swords, stakes and other weapons and missiles and composed of
imperturbable soldiers and elephants as high as the Mahendra Mountain?"
Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the equal of Indra in valour, then narrated to
Rama about the choicest army of the foremost among demons of the highest peculiarity (as
follows):
"O Prince! That hero who has a face with a coppery hue resembling a newly rising
sun, coming on the back of an elephant causing its head to sway, know him to be Akampana."
"He who, standing in his chariot, brandish his bow which has a splendour of Indra's
bow, whose standard bears the image of a lion, and who shines like unto an elephant with its
terrible curved tusks, he is Indrajit who is renowned for the boons he had received from
Brahma."
"He who, the archer like unto the Vindhya, Asta or Mahendra Mountains, standing in
his chariot, a mighty warrior, of superior strength, who wields a bow of unequalled size and having
an exceedingly grown body, he is called Atikaya."
"He who, with tawny eyes resembling the dawn, riding an elephant with its bells
jangling, who is shouting aloud, he is that strong demon of the highest peculiarity is called
Mahodara."
"He who, ascending the brilliantly caparisoned horse raising high a gleaming
javelin, possesses a velocity of a well-directed thunder-bolt and resembles a mass of evening
clouds and a mountain, he is Pishacha."
"He who, seizing a sharp spike with a possesses the velocity of a well-directed
thunder bolt and comes mounting on an excellent bull which shines like a moon, he is the
illustrious Trishiras."
"The other resembling a thunder-bolt, of large and well-developed chest, who has an
attentive mind, has the King of Snakes as his standard, who is moving and twanging his bow, he is
Kumbha."
"He who, holding a mace decorated with gold and diamonds, which are radiant (as
fire) and also smoky (studded with sapphires), who advances as a standard bearer tot he army of
demons, he is Nikumbha of Prodigious exploits."
"He who, mounted in a chariot, adorned with flags, gleaming like a glowing blazer,
who is furnished with bows swords and a multitude of arrows, he is Narantaka who shines brightly
over there and who, in combat, fights with mountain-tops."
"He who, surrounded by ghosts of dreadful form of rolling eyes, with heads of
tigers, buffalo mighty elephants, deer and horses, under an excellent white canopy with slender
ribs and shining like a moon, he who is the humbler of the gods themselves, shining like unto Rudra
amidst the genii, is the suzerain Lord of Demons there."
"Ravana, decked with a diadem, who has brought Indra the Lord of celestials and
Vaivasvata the Lord of Death low, is shining like the sun. His countenance is graced by ear-rings.
His formidable stature equals the Vindhya the Lord of Mountains."
Then, Rama the annihilator of enemies, answered Vibhishana and said "Alas! What
glory, what majesty is Ravana's the Lord of Demons!
"Ravana is beaming like the sun with his rays difficult to be gazed, neither can the
eye rest on him such is the binding strength of his magnificence!"
"The body of celestial or demonical heroes may not be so radiant in this manner as
this body of the king of demons."
"All the warriors of the suzerain Ravana are as high as hills. All fight with
mountains. All wield fiery weapons."
"Amidst the fiery ghosts of terrible aspect, this king of demons shines like Yama
the Lord of Death surrounded by blazing genii endowed with hideous forms."
"By good luck, that wretch comes today within my range of sight! Today, I shall
expunge my wrath, born of Seetha's abduction!"
Having spoken thus, the valiant Rama who was accompanied by Lakshmana, took up his
bow and then standing erect, drew out an excellent arrow.
Thereafter, that powerful Ravana spoke to those exceedingly strong demons as
follows: "Take up your positions unfalteringly and happily at the gates and principal exits, the
outposts and fortifications."
"Learning of my presence along with you here, taking this to be a weak point and
storming this desolate city which is otherwise difficult to be overpowered, the monkeys when united
may destroy it by surprise."
Having dismissed those counsellors and as the demons departed as ordered, Ravana
thereafter began to split under the waters of the sea of monkeys, in the same way as a gigantic
fish would rend the entire expanse of the sea.
Seeing Ravana with his radiant bow, in the battle, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeys
tearing up a huge mountain-top, ran towards that king of demons.
Seizing a mountain-top with its many trees and ridges, Sugreeva hurled it on Ravana
the demon. Seeing that mountain-top coming towards him, Ravana quickly broke it asunder with his
arrows with golden shafts.
While that mountain-top with its well-developed ridges and excellent trees was rent
asunder and fell on the earth, Ravana like unto another Yama the Lord of Death, loosed an arrow
resembling a great serpent.
The enraged Ravana, taking that arrow with the speed of a thunder bolt of Indra the
Lord of celestials and possessing the brilliance of a fire, hurled it to kill Sugreeva.
That arrow released by Ravana's arm reached Sugreeva, having a bodily splendour
equal to that of Indra's thunder bolt, and pierced his body in its flight as formerly Guha's spear
when he discharged it at the Krauncha Mountain.
Wounded by that arrow, which bereft him of consciousness, that warrior fell moaning
to the earth. Beholding him falling on the ground, deprived of his senses in the battle-field, the
demons raised a shout of triumph.
Then, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha, Jyotimukha and Nala; of exceeding
corpulence tearing up rocks, rushed towards Ravana.
That Lord of Demons, with hundreds of arrows, possessed of sharp points, rendered
their projectiles fruitless and pierced those leaders of the monkeys with a multitude of marvellous
golden shafted arrows.
Pierced by the arrows of Ravana the Enemy of Gods, those monkey-Generals of
terrifying stature fell on the ground. Thereupon, he covered that formidable army of monkeys with a
shower of arrows.
Assailed and fallen down, those monkey-warriors, emitted cries as though struck by
an arrow of terror, whom Ravana was destroying with his darts and fled for refuge to Rama who is
capable of affording protection to all.
Then the high-souled Rama the skilful archer, taking his bow, set out at once.
Lakshmana, however, approaching him with joined palms, spoke very meaningful words follows:
"O, noble Brother! Of my own accord, I am able to kill this wretched Ravana. O,
Lord! I shall slay him. Permit me to do so."
The exceedingly powerful and the truly courageous Rama spoke to that Lakshmana as
follows: "Go, Lakshmana and also be strenuous in this duel."
"Ravana is endowed with great strength and possesses an outstanding prowess during a war. The Three Worlds themselves could not withstand his fury. There is no doubt about it."
"Seek out his weak points and guard against your own. Defend yourself vigilantly
with your eye and bow."
Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana embraced him, thereafter offering obeisance and
bidding him farewell, he entered the battle-field.
Lakshmana then saw Ravana with arms as large as the trunks of elephants, who was
brandishing his dreadful and fiery bow, covering those monkeys whose bodies he had severed with a
close rain of darts.
The exceedingly energetic Hanuma, born of Maruta the god of wind, beholding this,
rushed on Ravana in order to bring that rain of arrows to an end.
Approaching his chariot, the sagacious Hanuma lifted his right arm and spoke the
following threatening words to Ravana:
"You have obtained the boon of invulnerability to the celestials, demons, celestial
musicians, ogres and semi-divine beings. But monkeys are a danger to you."
"This five-branched right hand of mine, which I now raise, will rob you of your life
that has long been resident in your body."
Hearing the words of Hanuma, the exceedingly valiant Ravana, his eyes inflamed with
anger, answered.
"Strike quickly without fear, O Monkey! Win eternal renown. Thereafter, I shall
destroy you, after measuring your strength."
Hearing the words of Ravana, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke the following words:
"Recollect that I have killed your son Aksha already."
Thus spoken, the highly energetic and the valiant Ravana the Lord of Demons struck
Hanuma the son of Anila a violent blow on his chest with the palm of his hand.
Hanuma, thus struck with Ravana's palm, reeled repeatedly. Thereafter the highly
sagacious and illustrious Hanuma secured his balance within a moment and in fury, struck Ravana the
enemy of Immortals with the very palm of his hand.
Under the violent impact of the blow of the mighty Hanuma Ravana shook like a
mountain when the earth trembles.
Beholding Ravana struck in the fight by Hanuma's palm; the sages, monkeys,
semi-divine beings, along with celestials and demons raised a resounding approbation.
Then, the extremely spirited Ravana, having regained his breath, spoke the following
words: "Well done! Well done! O, monkey! You are my adversary, worthy of praise by your
valour!"
Then, Hanuma answered, "O, Ravana! Cursed by that strength since you do still
survive!"
"O, foolish fellow! Why this boasting? Now come, strike me once! My fist is about to
dispatch you to the Abode of Yama the Lord of Death!"
Hearing the words of Hanuma, the powerful Ravana, enraged, his eyes red with fury
and whirling his fist with force knocked it down violently on Hanuma's chest.
Under the shock, Hanuma reeled once again. Seeing that mighty Hanuma exhausted,
Ravana turned his chariot towards Nila.
With his terrific arrows in the likeness of serpents, Ravana the powerful Lord of
Demons pierced the vital parts of his enemy, thus overwhelming Nila the Monkey-general.
Nila, the Army General of Monkeys, tormented by that hail of arrows, with one hand
hurled a great rock at Ravana the king of demons.
Meanwhile, Hanuma of exalted mind, burning with courage, regained his breath and in
his martial ire cried out furiously towards Ravana, the Lord of Demons who occupied in fight with
Nila as follows: "It is not proper to engage in a combat with a person who is already doing a fight
with another."
Then, the mighty Ravana, however, shattered the rock hurled by Nila with seven
pointed arrows and it fell down, crumbling to pieces.
Seeing that rock crumbling to pieces, Nila the Army-general the destroyer of enemies
who resembled the Fire of Time, glowed with fury.
In that fight, Nila hurled Aswakarna trees, Shala trees with extensive flowering,
Chuta trees and other various types of trees.
Ravana, confronting those trees, bursted them and showered a hail of dangerous darts
on Nila the son of Fire-God.
Showered by a multitude of shafts, as from a cloud, the mighty Nila assumed a
diminutive form and leapt on to the point of Ravana's standard.
Seeing Nila the son of Fire-God standing well on the point of his standard, Ravana
inflamed with fury. Then, Nila shouted loudly.
Beholding that monkey sometimes leaping on to the point of Ravana's standard
sometimes on to the tip of his bow and sometimes on to the peak of his diadem, Lakshmana, Hanuma
and Rama were astonished.
The mighty Ravana, amazed at the monkey's agility, seized a marvellous and glowing
arrow called Agneya the weapon of Fire.
Thereafter, those monkeys who felt rejoiced to see Ravana disconcerted at the
agility of Nila and had found an occasion for jubilation, shouted joyously.
Then, provoked by the shouts of the monkeys, his heart possessed with confusing,
Ravana did not know what to do.
Ravana the demon, taking up an arrow, charged with the missile presided over by the
fire-God, aimed at Nila who had perched on the tip of his standard.
Then, Ravana the king of demons said,: "O monkey! You are endowed with agility
combined with a supreme power of magic."
"Do you save your life if you can, eventhogh you are creating numerous deeds of
various kinds indeed worthy of your own self, O, monkey!"
"Even then, the arrow charged with a mystic missile I am about to loose, will severe
you from life, which existence you seek to preserve."
Thus speaking, Ravana the long-armed King of Demons, having placed Agni Missile with
his arrow, struck Nila the Army-General.
Struck on the chest by the arrow combined with a missile, Nila being burnt all over,
suddenly fell to the ground.
Yet by virtue of the powerful aid of his father and his own native vigour, though
brought to his knees on to the earth, he was not deprived of his life.
Seeing Nila unconscious, Ravana, eager for fight, in his chariot whose rattling
sounded like thunder-clouds, rushed on Lakshmana.
Coming to the centre of the battle-field, the powerful Ravana the King of Demons
prevented Lakshmana to go forward, halted, standing there in his glory and lifted up his bow.
Lakshmana of indomitable courage spoke to that Ravana who was lifting up his
unfathomable bow (as follows): "O, King of Demons! Now enter into combat with me; cease from
fighting with the monkeys!"
Hearing that marvellously modulated voice that resounded like the twanging of a
bow-string, Ravana drawing near his adversary, who stood close to his chariot, answered in
anger:
"O, Lakshmana! By my good fortune, you in your perverted mind, reached within my
range of sight so as to meet your death. This very instant, you will go to the region of Death,
after having collapsed by the bang of my rain of arrows."
Then, Lakshmana, unmoved spoke to that Ravana who was roaring with his sharp and
protruding teeth (as follows): "Greatly dignified ones eschew bragging! O, the foremost of
evil-doers! You are sounding your own praises!"
"O, King of Demons! I know your valour, strength, energy and courage! Come! I now
stand here, with my bow and arrows in hand. O what use are vain boasts."
Thus accosted, the King of Demons, infuriated, loosened seven marvellously plumed
arrows which Lakshmana shattered with his beautiful golden-shafted arrows of sharp ends and
edges.
Beholding those arrows shattered like great cobras with their hoods shattered,
Ravana got angry and loosened other sharp arrows.
Lakshmana, however, caused a well-aimed rain of missiles from his bow to fall on
Ravana and nay, even broke Ravana's arrows with his arrows called Khura, Ardhachandra, the
excellent Karni and Bhalla. He did not feel perturbed.
Seeing his successive arrows proving in vain, Ravana the King of those hostile to
Gods was astonished at Lakshmana's skill and released more whetted shafts upon him.
Lakshmana, the equal of Mahendra the Lord of celestials, fixing some sharpened
arrows, swift as lightning and of blazing effulgence on his bow-string, discharged them on Ravana
in order to strike him down.
Whereupon, Ravana the King of Demons shattered those pointed arrows and struck
Lakshmana in the forehead with a struck Lakshmana in the forehead with a shaft as bright as the
Fire of Time, which had been bestowed on him by Brahma the Lord of Creation.
Struck by Ravana's arrow, Lakshmana reeled a little and was scarcely able to retain
his bow. But, coming to his consciousness with difficulty, he shattered that weapon belonging to
Ravana, Indra's enemy.
Then, Lakshmana the son of Dasaratha struck Ravana, whose bow was broken, with three
pointed darts. The king, pierced by those arrows, swooned and regained his senses with
difficulty.
Ravana, the enemy of celestials, whose bow was broken, struck by the arrows, his
limbs spattered with flesh, and streaming with blood, himself of formidable energy, seized in the
battle a spear gifted to him by Brahma the Lord of Creation.
Ravana the Lord of the country of demons hurled with strength on Lakshmana, that
blazing spear, emitting smoke and as bright as fire, frightening the monkeys in the fray.
Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata struck that weapon falling upon him with
arrows and darts, as if it were a sacrificial fire. Nevertheless, that spear entered Lakshmana's
broad chest.
The mighty Lakshmana, struck by the spear, lay on the earth, breathing fire. The
king, rushing suddenly on him who was yet insensible, seized him brutally in his hands.
Though he was able to lift up Himavat, Mandara and Meru mountains as also the Three
Worlds with the Gods, he could not raise Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata.
Lakshmana, though wounded in the breast by Brahma's weapon, recollected that he was
an inconceivable fraction of Vishnu Himself.
Ravana that thorn in the side of the Gods, though overcoming that Lakshmana who
removed the pride of demons, was unable to bear him away with his hands.
Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma the son of the Wind-God, rushed towards Ravana and
struck angrily on his chest with his fist, resembling a thunder-bolt.
By that blow of the fist, Ravana the Lord of Demons reeled and fell on his knees to
the ground.
A lot of blood oozed out from his face, eyes, and ears. Reeled and motionless, he
became and sat in the middle of the chariot.
Seeing Ravana despite his redoubtable strength swooned on the battle-field, sages
and monkeys began to shout in triumph as did also celestials and the demons (invisibly present on
the scene).
Then, the courageous Hanuma lifting up Lakshmana in his arms, who had been wounded
by Ravana, brought him to Rama's presence.
That Lakshmana, whom his foes were unable to move, became light for Hanuma because
of friendship and great devotion of Hanuma the son of Wind-God towards him.
That spear leaving Lakshmana, who was overcome in the battle, returned to its
position in that chariot of Ravana.
The mighty Ravana too, regaining his consciousness in the great battle-field, picked
up his sharp arrows and the great bow.
Healed and free from that lance, Lakshmana the annihilator of his foes, recollected
of himself as a part of the inconceivable Vishnu the Lord of Preservation.
Beholding the great army of monkeys whose great warriors were overthrown on the
battle-field, Rama rushed on Ravana.
Meanwhile, Hanuma approaching Rama spoke the following words: "You have to punish
the demon by climbing my back, as Vishnu on Garuda in order to fight with the Enemy of Gods."
Hearing those words spoken by Hanuma the son of Wind-God, Rama soon after mounted
the great monkey, Hanuma. Rama the Lord of men then saw Ravana standing in his chariot in the
battle-field.
The mighty Rama became angry on seeing him and rushed upon that Ravana like unto
Vishnu with his uplifted mace rushed upon Virochana.
Rama made a sound in drawing the cord of his bow and like unto the roll of thunder,
spoke in a deep voice to Ravana as follows:
"O, Tiger among the Demons! Stay, stay! Having evoked such a displeasure to me,
where will you flee and get an abandonment?"
"Even if you seek refuge in the region of Indra the Lord of celestials or Yama the
Lord of Death or the Sun or Brahma the Lord of Creation or Agni the Lord of Fire or Shiva the Lord
of dissolution or in the ten regions, even in those abodes you will elude me from now on."
"O, Ravana the King of Demons! The one who was struck by the spear, fell swooping
this day only to recover consciousness immediately, will now, assuming the form of death, claim
you, your sons and grandsons in battle."
"Here is he, under whose blows of arrows, fourteen thousand demons of terrible form
perished, who had established themselves in Janasthana and were furnished with excellent
weapons."
Hearing the words of Rama, Ravana of great strength, full of rage and recollecting
his former hostility struck with flaming arrows resembling the tongues of the Fire of Dissolution,
on Hanuman the son of Wind-God, who with extreme velocity, was bearing Rama in the
battle-field.
Even when struck by that demon with his arrows in the battle, the vigour of Hanuman,
who was endowed with native strength, increased still further.
Thereupon, seeing Hanuman the Tiger among the monkeys getting wounded by Ravana,
Rama was transported with anger.
Going near his chariot with his sharp and pointed arrows, Rama shattered it along
with its wheels, horses, banner, canopy, great standard, charioteer, darts, spears and swords.
Thereupon, with a great force, Rama struck with his shaft shining brightly as the
thunderbolt, that Ravana, the enemy of Indra, in his broad and beautiful chest, even as the mighty
Indra would strike the Mount Meru with his thunderbolt.
That valiant King of Demons, whom neither thunder nor lightning could cause
disturbance or trembling; stumbled letting fall his bow at the valiant impact of Rama's missile
which created a deep injury.
Seeing that Ravana swooning, the magnanimous Rama took up a blazing arrow shaped
like a crescent moon and immediately used it to shatter the diadem of Ravana the Lord of Demons,
which was of bright hue.
In that battle-field, Rama said to that Lord of Demons whose splendour was dimmed,
the setting of his diadem river, who resembled a venomous snake robbed of its poison or like a sun
its rays extinguished, bereft of lustre.
"You have accomplished a highly terrific great feat and my brave soldiers have
succumbed beneath your blows. Now, you are weary and in this condition, I shall not put you under
the clutches of Death."
"O, King of the Ranger of night! I know you have been tormented in the battle. Go
and return to Lanka. Having regained your breath, come back in your chariot with your bow and then
standing in your chariot, you will witness once more my prowess."
At these words, that King Ravana, his joy boasting subdued, his bow shattered, his
horses and chariot slain pierced with arrows, his great diadem broken, he soon returned to
Lanka.
While that mighty Ravana the Lord of Demons and the enemy of celestials and titans
returned to Lanka, Rama arranged for drawing out arrows from monkeys and from Lakshmana too, in the
forefront of that vast battle-field.
That Ravana, the adversary of the King of the Gods being vanquished, the celestials,
Asuras the multitude of beings in all the quarters, the creatures of the ocean with the great
serpents as also all beings on earth and in waters rejoiced very much.On hearing Makaraksha having been killed, Ravana who had been ever victorious in
battle, grinding his teeth in rage, reflected on what to do then and there, and as greatly furious
as he was, instructed Indrajit, his son to proceed to the battle-field.
"O hero! Either remaining yourself invisible or visible, kill Rama and Lakshmana,
the brothers of great prowess. You are superior in strength by all means."
"You have conquered Indra, of incomparable deeds, in battle. Can you not kill those
two men, on seeing them in the battle-field?"
Hearing the words of Ravana, that Indrajit, bowing to the command of his father,
poured oblations into the sacred fire, with due ceremony, on the sacrificial ground.
Even as he was pouring oblations into the sacred fire there, the female-demons
carrying red turbans (for the use of priests) hastily arrived at the spot where Indrajit was
there.
Weapons (such as a lance) served as blades of Shara grass (for being spread around
the sacrificial fire). Chips of wood of Vibhitaka tree served as wooden sticks to feed the
sacrificial fire as also red robes and iron ladles were used for cleaning and pouring clarified
melted butter into the sacrificial fire.
Having spread on the ground around all the sides of the sacrificial fire with other
weapons along with lances, the demon seized hold of the neck of a live goat, entirely black and
consigned it to the fire.
Such omens as betokened victory appeared in the smokeless fire which burst into
mighty flames, when it was fully aroused by that single offering.
Becoming visible in person, the god of fire, who was shooting out flames towards the
right and who shone brightly like refined gold, received that offering.
Offering oblations in fire and gratifying the gods, the devils and demons, Indrajit
ascended an excellent and splendid chariot, capable of disappearing from sight.
Drawn by four horses, provided with sharp arrows and a mighty bow placed on it, that
excellent chariot looked beautiful.
Adorned with gold, that chariot glittered on account of its body and was decorated
with carved images of antelopes, full moons and crescents.
The flag-post of Indrajit shone like a flaming fire, provided, as it was, with large
rings of gold and decorated with cat's eye gems.
Protected by the missile presided over by Brahma, which was as efflugent as the sun,
that Indrajit endowed with exceptional strength, became difficult to be attacked.
Coming forth from the city and having acquired the capacity of vanishing from the
sight, by offering oblations into the sacred fire, with the uttereance of spells sacred to demons,
that indrajit, who was ever victorious in war, spoke as follows:
"By killing both the princes who left home to become religious mendicants in the
forest in vain, I will present a gift of victory secured in the battle, to my father, Ravana
today."
"By making the earth bereft of monkeys today and by killing Rama and Lakshmana, I
will create a great spleasure". Thus speaking, Indrajit vanished from thes sight.
Impelled, as he was, by Ravana, the fiery Indrajit, with his barbarons bow and steel
arrows, swiftly came to the battle-field enraged.
That Indrajit saw the two heroes, showering a multitude of arrows. Both the princes,
having mighty prowess, looked like three- hooded serpents in the middle of the monkeys.
Concluding that both of them were the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana and stringing
his bow, he covered them with a flood of arrows, as the rainy clouds do.
That Indrajit with his chariot, reaching the sky and remaining invisible, struck
Rama and Lakshmana with his sharp arrows.
When enveloped by a stream of arrows Rama and Lakshamana, fitted arrows to their
bows and revealed divine missiles.
Though covering the sky with a net-work of arrows, the two mighty princes could not
touch Indrajit with their arrows charged with mystic missiles and which were efflugent like the
sun.
Covering the sky, the illustrious Indrajit created a dark-like smoke. He made the
quarters also invisible, by enclosing them with mist-liek darkness.
While Indrajit was moving about, neither the sound produced by the impact of his
palm on the bow string was heard, nor the sound of his wheels or the clattering of hoofs of his
horses could be heard, nor did his form come tot he view.
In that thick darkness, that long-armed Indrajit showered hails of his steel arrows,
like wonderful shower of rocks.
That enraged Indrajit in battle, abundantly pierced Rama in all his limbs with his
arrows, which were earlier granted as boons to him and which were effluent like the sun.
Both Rama and Lakshmana, the foremost of men, who were being struck with steel
arrows, like two mountains being hit by torrents, released sharp golden-shafted arrows.
Those arrows, adorned with plumes of heron, reaching Indrajit in the sky and
piercing him, fell to the ground, soaked in blood.
Shining beyond measure with a flood of arrows, the two excellent men began to chop
off those arrows which were falling on them with many arrows called by the name of Bhallas.
Both Rama and Lakshmana for their part directed their excellent missiles in the
direction from which they saw the aforesaid sharp arrows, fallen.
Indrajit for his part, who was a superior chariot-warrior and who was swift in
discharging missiles, rushed on towards all sides and pierced Rama and Lakshmana with his sharp
arrows.
Those valiant princes, Rama and Lakshmana pierced deeply with well-made goldne
shafted arrows, appeared like two Kamshuka trees in flowering.
No one could perceive his rapid movement, like the position of the sun when the sky
is thickly overcast with clouds, nor his form nor his bows and arrows, nor any other thing about
him whatsoever could be known.
Struck down by him, the monkeys were killed. The monkeys dropped dead in hundreds on
the earth's surface there.
Then, Lakshmana for his part was enraged and told his brother that he would employ
the missile presided over by Brahma for the purpose of killing all the demons.
Then, Rama spoke to that Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks as
follows: "You ought not to kill all the demons on earth, merely for the sake of a single
demon."
"You ought not to kill on this earth one who is not fighting or one who is hiding or
one who seeks refuge with joined palms or is fleeing or is intoxicated."
"O long-armed Lakshmana! We shall try to kill Indrajit alone. We will employ mystic
mssiles with great impetuosity and which are equal to venomous serpents."
"On seeing this demons, the leaders of mokey-troops will forcibly kill this petty
demon, who is skilled in conjuring tricks and whose chariot remains invisible."
"Scorched by my mystic missiles, he will fall dead on the ground, even if he enters
the earth or into heaven or into the subterrranean world or penetrates the vault of heaven and
remains completely hidden in this manner."
Speaking highly meaningful words in the aforesaid manner, the great-souled Rama,
surrounded by the foremost of monkeys, started to reflect on the speedy means of killing the
furious Indrajit, the demons of cruel deeds.Then, Ravana an eminent person in the assembly, having seen all that gathering,
instructed Prahasta the chief of his army (as follows):
"O, commander! You are allowed to issue an order to see that well-trained warriors
belonging to the four divisions of the army (viz.cavalry, infantry, chariots and elephants) are
entrusted with the defense of the city."
Prahasta, resolute in his mind to follow the king's orders stationed the whole army
both outside as well as inside the city.
Thereafter, Prahasta after keeping the whole army in defence of the city, sat in
front of the king and spoke (as follows):
Your army, as strong as you are, has been positioned both outside and inside the
city. Pray do quickly, with an undistracted mind, whatever is preferable to you."
Hearing the words of Prahasta, who wished the welfare of the kingdom, king Ravana,
with a desire to obtain happiness, spoke in the desire midst of his friends as follows:
When you are in difficult situations regarding virtue pleasure and wealth, you are
able to have a correct notion of pleasant and unpleasant things, happiness and sorrow, gain and
detriment as well as advantages and disadvantages."
"All of my works undertaken by you with an act of attention, were never in
vain."
"I will obtain maximum prosperity, while abiding with you, as Indra obtains
properity while abiding with moon, planets, stars and celestials."
"I am intent on reminding all of you again. But I could not inform this matter
earlier to Kumbhakarna because of his sleep."
"This most powerful Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the wielders of weapons, was
indeed sleeping for the last six months and now, he woke up."
"Seetha the beloved wife of Rama was brought from the forest of Dandaka, the place
frequented by demons."
Seetha of languid pace, does not like to reach my bed. I do not imagine any other
woman similar to Seetha existing in the three worlds."
"She has a slim waist, well-developed hips, and a face similar to an autumnal moon.
Looking like an idol of gold and being placid She appears like an illusory image created by
Maya.
"Seeing Her feet with rose-coloured soles, smooth and evenly resting on ground with
the rosy soles, my lust is kindled."
"Seeing her countenance similar to the flame of a sacrificial fire and looking like
the radiance of the sun, with her prominent nose and the pretty clear and handsome eyes, I became
unrestrained, having submitted to the will of my passion."
"I have been polluted by lust and equally by anger and pleasure thus making me pale
and I have been ever since in grief and anguish."
"Looking forward Rama, her husband, that longish large eyed Seetha, requested me to
give time for one year. I accepted the auspicious words of the charmingly eyed Seetha. I am wearied
of this lust, like a horse galloping along a path continuously."
How the monkeys or even Rama and Lakshmana can cross the unassailable ocean,
completely infested as it was with sea-animals?"
"on the other hand, a huge destruction was done to us, by a single monkey. The
consequences of their acts are unpredictable. Tell me what is there in your mind, according to your
own understanding."
"We have no fear with human beings. Even so, the matter can be discussed. Earlier,
together with you, I conquered the celestials in a battle between the celestials and demons. You
also conquered them. Knowing the whereabouts of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana together with Sugreeva
and other monkeys reached the other shore of the ocean."
"Let a consultation be held by you and a judicious line of course suggested, so that
Seetha may not have to be handed -over to them back and Rama and Lakshmana may be killed."
"I do not see any other's capability to cross the ocean even so with the monkeys.
Victory is surely mine."
Hearing the lamentation of Ravana who was captivated by lust, Kumbhakarana became
angry and spoke the following words:
"You should have contemplated thoroughly that very moment when Seetha was brought
here forcibly only after a single impulsive thought from the hermitage of Rama, who was accompanied
by Lakshmana, even like the river Yamuna fills the depression at its source the moment it descends
on earth."
"O, emperor! If all this act of consultation with us was done at the beginning of
this action itself (of bringing Seetha here), it would have been worthy of you."
"O, Ravana! A king who performs king's functions with a mind duly ascertained by
justice, will not repent thereafter."
"Actions done pervertedly without use of any stratagem get spoiled, even as
oblations not intent on devotion got spoiled.
"He who is not aware of prudence and imprudence, wants to do actions which are to be
done before at a later stage and actions which are to be done later at a stage before."
"Seeing superior strength in a hasteful enemy, some look for his weak point, even as
swans seek the cleavage in the Kraunca mountain."
"This great act was undertaken by you without proper thinking. By good fortune, Rama
did not kill you even as the meat mixed with poison would kill the consumer."
"O, irreproachable brother! Therefore by killing your enemies, I shall neutralize
the dishonourable act undertaken by you in relation to your enemies."
"O, ranger of night! I shall destroy your enemies. I shall do battle with the two
brothers, even if they are Indra and the sun-god or the god of fire and the wind-god or Kubera (the
god of riches) and Varuna (the god of water).
"Entering the combat with a mountain-sized body and fiery teeth, roaring the while
and attacking with an immense bludgeon, I shall strike terror in Indra himself!"
"Even before Rama strikes me once more with a second arrow, I shall drink his blood.
Cheer up freely.
"I shall try to fetch victory, which brings pleasure to you, by the killing of Rama.
By exterminating Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the leaders of monkey-troops."
"Enjoy yourself freely. Drink excellent of wines to the extent of your desire
without any anxiety. Rama, having been dispatched by me to the abode of death, Seetha will be at
your disposal forever."Hearing that Vajradamshtra was killed by Angada, Ravana spoke the following words to
the General of his forces who, with joined palms, stood near him.
"Let the invincible demons of irresistible courage go forth soon, with Akampana as
their head, who is skilled in the use of every weapon and missile."
"This excellent demon is a chastiser, a protector and a leader in battle. He ever
desired my welfare and always loved war."
"There is no doubt that he will prove victorious and Rama, Lakshmana, the mighty
Sugreeva and the other terrible monkeys."
Taking that command of Ravana, the mighty Akampana of quick resolution then
mobilized the army.
Those foremost of demons of terrifying appearance, furnished with every kind of
weapon and fearful to look upon, rushed into the fray where their general had dispatched them.
Then, Akampana of the stature and colour of a cloud, whose voice resembled a
thunder, ascended his great chariot, decorated with fine gold and set out, surrounded by dreadful
demons.
Even celestials were indeed unable to upset Akampana in a great battle. Hence, among
the demons, he was shining like the sun, by his splendour.
As he sped on his way, hastened and eager to enter the battle, the horses drawing
his chariot were suddenly deprived of their energy.
The left eye of Akampana, who delighted in warfare, began to twitch. His countenance
grew pale and his voice trembled.
At a time of a good day, marked by fine weather, it turned into a day of bad weather
with a bitter wind beginning to blow. Birds and beasts uttered cruel and fearful cries.
That demon, who had the shoulders of a lion and the agility of a tiger, disregarding
those portents, rushed towards the battle-field.
While Akampana advanced thus with his troops, an immense tumult arose that seemed to
convulse the ocean.
By hearing that clamour of the demons coming for the battle, the huge army of the
monkeys, brandishing trees and rocks, was frightened.
A highly fierce battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were ready to
lose their lives for the sake of Rama and Ravana.
All the monkeys and demons, who were willing to kill each other, were very strong
and valiant. All were resembling mountains.
The tremendous clamour of the aforesaid warriors, yelling in their rage and
strength, making savage cries, were distinctly heard on the battle-field.
A highly terrific dust, in a thick coppery colour, raised by the monkeys and demons
enveloped all the ten quarters.
The combatants, enveloped by that dust, which was whitish like a piece of silk
shaken by the wind, could no longer distinguish each other on the battle-field.
Neither standard, banner and shield, nor horse, weapon and chariot could be
discerned in that pall of dust.
A great tumultuous clamour, of warriors, making challenging cries and rushing upon
each other, was heard on the battle-field, yet in that confusion, no form was visible.
In the darkness, the greatly enraged monkeys killed the monkeys themselves and the
demons killed the demons themselves in battle.
Those monkeys and demons killing other and their own people then made the earth
dampened with blood, anointing its body with mud.
Under the stream of blood being sprinkled, the dust was laid, revealing the earth
covered with bodies and corpses.
The demons and the monkeys vigorously struck each other swiftly with blows from
trees, spears, maces, javelins, stones, bars and picks.
The monkeys of dreadful deeds, resembling mountains, fighting with their arms
appearing like iron bars, killed the demons in battle.
The enraged demons with darts and javelins in their hands, struck the monkeys there
with their cruel weapons.
The extremely enraged Akampana, the general of the army of demons, cheered all those
demons by his terrible prowess.
The monkeys however leaping upon them and snatching their weapons through their
strength, crushed those demons with blows from large trees and stones.
Meanwhile Kumuda, Nala and Mainda the courageous monkeys in an outburst of anger,
displayed unsuprassed rashness.
Those exceedingly valiant chiefs of monkeys, as in sport, in the battle-front, with
mighty blows of trees, created a great carnage among the demons. All of them repeatedly crushed the
demons with every kind of weapon.Hearing those words of the high=souled Hanuma, Ravana duly excited with anger, ordered 
for the killing of Hanuma.
While it was ordered by the evil-natured Ravana for the killing of Hanuman, Vibhishana 
did not agree to the killing of Hanuma, who was entrusted with the functions of a messenger.
Seeing Ravana getting enraged and looking to that affair (of the killing of an envoy) that 
has arisen, Vibhishana who was firm in accompanying any object, reflected upon an appropriate action 
to be done.
Then, deciding on the right action, Vibhishna, who was skilled in communication and a 
conqueror of enemies spoke softly the following very meaningful and useful words to Ravana, his venerable 
brother.
"O king of demons! Forgive and give up your anger. Be gracious and hear my words. Virtuous 
kings of excellence, knowing the distant and the near, do not cause the killing of an envoy."
"O hero! Killing this monkey is against a royal virtue and any universal custom condemns 
it. Hence, it is improper for you also to do it."
"You are indeed the knower of what is right. You are a person of gratitude. You are well-versed 
in royal virtues. You know both the distant and the near in beings. You know the highest truth."
"If even learned persons like you are seized by anger, then the knowledge of scriptures 
is indeed just a labor in vain."
"O king of demons! O annihilator of enemies, dangerous to be approached! Therefore, be 
graceful. After ascertaining about right and wrong, let appropriate punishment be ordered to the envoy."
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana the lord of demons was greatly enraged and replied 
in the following words:
"O Vibhishana, the annihilator of enemies! There is no sin, even if the sinners are killed. 
So, I shall kill this monkey, who performed sins."
Hearing those words, rooted in unrighteousness, enveloped in a great anger and accepted 
by the dishonorable, Vibhishana the best among those who were endowed with understanding, spoke the 
following words, comprising of the highest truth.
"O king of demons! O lord of Lanka! Be gracious enough. Hear my words endowed with righteousness 
and significance. O king! Sages say that messengers should not be killed at all places and at all times."
"There is no doubt that this enemy is arrogant. He has created an unlimited displeasure 
for us. But, sages do not talk about the killing of an envoy There are indeed severe punishments, intended 
for an envoy."
"Some of the punishments to an envoy are deforming the limbs, striking with a whip, shaving 
the head, and impressing marks on the body. Indeed, we have not heard at any time of killing a messenger."
"How can a person like you, hold an intellect trained in religious merit and purpose 
and a right judgment on cause and effect, be subject to anger? Wise people indeed contain their anger."
"O hero! There is no one equal to you, who can discuss about the law or duty, none about 
universal custom, and none in capturing the essence of scriptures. You are indeed excellent among all 
the celestials and demons in these matters."
"O king of demons! You are valiant. You are heroic. Even celestials and demons cannot 
conquer you. You conquered a multitude of proud celestials and demons together with their kings in battles 
several times"
"I do not see any merit in killing this monkey. Let this carnal punishment be employed 
on those by whom this monkey was sent."
"He is a person, sent by our enemies, whether he is good or bad. It is not worthy of 
killing him, who is an envoy, who is dependent on others, and who talks for the cause of others."
"O king! Moreover, If he is killed, I do not find any other person, who can travel through 
the sky and come here again to this shore of the great ocean."
"O conqueror of enemies! Therefore, do not make an effort to kill him. On the other hand, 
you ought to strengthen such effort on celestials including Indra."
"O Ravana, who is fond of war! If he is dead, I do not find any other hero, who can incite 
those two arrogant princes, who are hindered by a long distance, for war."
"O Ravana who can gladden the hearts of demons! It is not proper for you, who are difficult 
to be conquered by even celestials and demons having sufficient prowess energy and courage, to crush 
the arrival of a war."
"There are more than a crore of valiant warriors in your charge, well-maintained, who 
desire your welfare, quite devoted, having colossal merits, born in a good tribe, holding high spirits 
and excellent wielders of weapons."
"Therefore, let some who follow your command, by talking a portion of your army, subjugate 
those two stupid princes, to make your power known to your adversaries."
Ravana, the mighty and eminent king of demons is also the lord of ogres and the adversary 
of the world of celestials, understood the cherished and excellent message of Vibhishana his brother 
with his due presence of mind."On hearing of Nikumbha and Kumbha having been killed, Ravana was very much flared up
like fire.
Engulfed with both anger and sorrow, Ravana ordered the wide-eyed Makaraksha, the
son of Khara (as follows):
"I am commanding you! Accompanied by an army, go my son! Kill Rama, Lakshmana and
the monkeys."
Hearing Ravana's words, Makaraksha, the son of Khara, thinking himself as a hero,
was rejoiced and assured Ravana that he would do it certainly as commanded.
Having respectfully saluted, even by performing circumambulation, the mighty
Makaraksha, by the orders of Ravana, came forth from these shining palace of Ravana.
Makaraksha the son of Khara asked the commander of an army who was in the vicinity
to bring a chariot and the army swiftly.
Hearing his words, the army-commander of the demons brought the chariot and the army
to his proximity.
Walking clockwise round the chariot and ascending it, Makaraksha asked the
charioteer to drive forward the chariot quickly to the battle-field.
Then Makaraksha spoke the following words to those demons, "O demons! All of you
begin your fight before my presence."
"The mighty Ravana, the king of demons commanded me to kill both Rama and Lakshmana
in battle."
"Today, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva the monkey and the other monkeys with
my excellent arrows, O demons!"
"By hurling the spears, I will destroy completely the huge army of monkeys who
arrived today to the battle-field, as the fire destroys the dry wood."
Hearing those words of Makaraksha, all those strong demons, wielding various kinds
of weapons, were steadfast to fight.
Those cruel demons, who can change their forms at will, who had protruding tusks,
had tawny coloured eyes, had their disheveled hair, creating terror with their colossal bodies,
then marched forward like roaring elephants, shaking the firmament and surrounded the huge-bodied
Makaraksha.
There arose a great tumult sounded, on all sides, of thousands of couches and
kettle-drums including leonine roars and clapping of arms.
The long whip then slipped down from the hands of Makaraksha's charioteer and the
flag-staff of that demon also suddenly fell down by the will of the province.
Those horses, yoked to his chariot, deprived of their diversified gait, were walking
with flurried feet and went timidly, with tears in their eyes.
At the time of marching of that dreadful and evil-minded Makaraksha, a harsh and
fearful dust-storm blew forth.
Though seeing those portents, all those highly valiant demons ignored them and set
out to the place, where both Rama and Lakshmana were there.
Saying thunderously, "I shall take the lead", those demons who resembled black
clouds, elephants and buffaloes in hue, who had been wounded pointedly more than once by maces and
swords in the battle-front and who were skilled in martial art, moved hither and thither in the
battle-field.Raghava's younger brother Lakshmana is very much infuriated at Seetha who spoke to him rudely, as such 
he journeyed towards Rama at once as though he is yearning to see Rama immediately, albeit his heart 
wanted him to stand guard to Seetha. 
Quickly taking hold of intervallic time then the ten-headed Ravana approached Vaidehi adopting an aspect 
of a sanyaasi, a meandering Brahman friar. 
That sanyaasi is now cloaked in smooth silky saffron, his head-hair is neatly tufted, sandals are wooden, 
umbrella is on right shoulder, and on his left shoulder a shaft of sanyaasi is shouldered, onto which 
his handy water vessel is hooked, and he proceeded towards Vaidehi in a mien of meandering sanyaasi. 

As with a pitchiest gloom overcoming the sunless and moonless lively eventide, that great-mighty Ravana 
came over to Vaidehi in that forest, when she is without two of the brothers, namely Rama and Lakshmana. 

As a sinister planet looks over Star Rohini when she is devoid of Moon, that extremely sinister Ravana 
then looked over the glorious and youthful princess Seetha. 
On observing ferocious Ravana whose activities are iniquitous, the trees of Janasthaana are not in full 
sway, nor the wind is in full swing. 
On seeing him who is seeing with his bloodshot eyes, River Godavari too is frightened and started to 
rush off quietly, whose onrush will be rapid otherwise. 
In the meanwhile the Decahedron demon Ravana, who is all the while waiting for some lapse of Rama, neared 
Vaidehi in the getup of a sanyaasi. 
That disgraceful Ravana made advances in a graceful mien of Brahman almsman to Vaidehi who is thinking 
over her husband, like the slow moving Saturn making advance to Star Citra which will be ominous. 
Like a wellspring shrouded by grass, enshrouded in a decent getup of a Brahman friar, in a trice Ravana 
leeringly stood before of Vaidehi, the admirable wife of Rama. 
While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are 
fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and 
sitting in the straw-cottage, and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry 
silks, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. 
He who is hit by the arrows of Love-god that king of demons Ravana, on seeing Seetha entered resonating 
the resonances of Vedic-hymns as precursory in seeking alms, and spoke these well-mannered sentences 
to her who is in solitariness. 
Ravana really acclaimed her who is an excellent one in all the three worlds, beaming forth with the 
beauty of her body, and who is like Goddess Lakshmi but for Divine-lotus as Her settle, for Seetha is 
devoid of her settling, namely Rama. 
"Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded 
with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?" Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha 
"Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous 
Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a 
self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God. 
"Your teeth are evenly, smooth and their tips are like jasmine buds, and your whitish broad eyes are 
spotless, reddish at ends, and pupils are black. 
"Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant's trunks, and these two breasts of yours that are 
ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up 
and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they 
are covetable for they are beautiful. 
"Oh, allurer, your smile is alluring, teeth are alluring, and your eyes allure, oh, beauty, your waist 
is palmful, your hair velvety, your breasts are jostling, and you rob my soul as a spate robs riverbank. 

"I have not hitherto seen any earthly female with this kind of features on the face of earth; or, a 
goddess - no; a gandharva female - no; yaksha female - no; kinnaraa female - no, none whosoever! 
"I marvel why an excellent one in all the three worlds by her features, more so, fragile and youthful 
as yourself should be living here in the thick of forest. 
Such as you are you go back, let safety betide you, as you are unsuited to live in here, for this forest 
is the dwelling for ghastly demons who by their wish will be changing their guise. 
"Delightful rooftops of skyscrapers, flourishing and richly fragranced pleasure-gardens of cities alone 
are meetly to you to saunter. 
Oh, beauteous lady, I opine that only best garlands, best scents, best foodstuffs, best clothing are 
meetly to you, oh, lady with black pupils, hence it is meet and right to you to have a best husband.
"Getting at you, the garlands, scents, foodstuffs, or clothing, they all become the best, because you 
are the best beauteous one, as such, he alone becomes a best person who gets you as his wife, and it 
is meet and right to you to choose such a husband,  
"Oh, curvaceous lady, who are you? Oh, one with an impeccable smile, do you belong to Rudraa-gods, or 
Marut-gods, or to Vasu-s? To me you are beaming forth like a goddess. 
"This is the dwelling-place of demons, and no goddess, nor a gandharva, nor a kinnara can arrive here, 
but how you have come here? 
"Here, simians, lions, leopards, tigers, likewise other predators, bears, tigers, vultures will be moving. 
How you are not frightened from them? 
"Being alone in this forest, oh, lady with a lovely face, how you are unafraid of horrendous and mighty 
elephants possessed of rut? 
"Oh, auspicious lady, who are you? Whose are you? Also from where are you? And being lonely, what for 
you are moving in dreadful Dandaka forest that is adored by demons?" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. 
When the wicked minded Ravana praised her in this way, Vaidehi the princess from Mithila has seen him 
who has arrived in the getup of Brahman and started to revere him with all the respects affordable to 
a casual guest. 
She firstly fetched a seat him, then invited him with water for feet-wash, and then said to him who 
looked gracious in his bearing, 'alms are ready.' 
Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and finding no reason to refute him flatly, as he has come like a Brahman, she invited him as a Brahman.
Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and as he came with an unimperilling appearance of a Brahman, she invited him as she would 
ordinarily invite a real Brahman. 
"Oh, Brahman, this is the Darbha-grass-seat and you be seated comfortably, here is water, receive it 
for hand and feet wash, here is the forest grown victuals for your sake... dine on them relaxedly..." 
Thus Seetha said to Ravana. 
Ravana thoroughly observed that wife of the king, Maithili, when she invited him talking civilities 
contextual in inviting a guest, that too Brahman sanyasi, and he firmed up his mind to abduct her even 
forcibly, and started to dedicate himself for destruction. 
Then she looked forward for her shapely husband who has gone on a hunting game, and who must be returning 
along with Lakshmana, and though she looked intently she could only see the green backdrop of that great 
forest, but not Rama or Lakshmana. On hearing the exciting advise of Shuurpanakha then Ravana bade adieu to ministers, and indeed on resolving 
his further task he proceeded to his personal palace chambers. 
While following up his thinking about that task he got a pertinent thought, and on deliberating about 
the credits and discredits, strengths and weaknesses of that thought he decided that 'this is to be 
done in this method only.' On taking a decision in that way and with a firm mind he indeed proceeded 
to his excellent vehicle-garage. 
That lordly demon then has gone to the vehicle garage in secrecy, and directed the charioteer thus as, 
'let the chariot be harnessed.' 
When that brisk-paced charioteer is said in this way he instantly harnessed the favourite and choicest 
chariot of Ravana with horses and got it ready. 
That chariot which is decorated with golden ornaments, yoked with monster-faced mules that have gem 
studded trappings is rideable by the wish of the rider, and sitting in such a chariot which is wholly 
golden and which rides with a sound like the pealing of thunder, that celebrated Ravana, the brother 
of Kubera and the lord of demons, travelled towards the lord of rivers and rivulets, namely the ocean. 

Dasha-aanana, the decahedral demon, whose complexion like the smoothened Lapis-gem is lustrous, whose 
regalia that comprise white long-furred fans, white parasol and the like is spectacular, whose ornaments 
made out of refined gold are glittering, who similar to a kingly mountain with ten pinnacles and crags 
by way of his ten heads and twenty arms is gorgeous, and such a chief of demons who by that way is an 
adversary of gods and cutthroat of eminent-sages, seated in a nitid golden chariot that is rideable 
by the wish of its steersman, he shone forth like a black-cloud fringed with the streaks of lightning 
and rimmed with flights of cranes. 
That dauntless Ravana forged ahead while viewing the area along the coastline which is interspersed 
with thousands of mountains and which is with variously flowered and fruited trees. 
Everywhere the coastland is bedecked with lotus-lakes containing clean and cool waters, and with extensive 
thresholds of hermitages containing Fire-altars. 
Entire coast is gleaming with banana plantation and glistening with coconut trees, and the saala, palm, 
and tamaala trees are also in full blossom. 
It is brightened up with thousands of reptiles and birds, with those many celestial beings that frequent 
the earth like gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s. And with eminent sages who have highly controlled food-habits, 
as well. It is also refulgent with the self-denying Siddha-s, Carana-s, and with sages that are the 
brainchildren of Brahma, namely Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s. 
With thousands of celestial maidens divine in their mien, namely apsara-s, who are prettified with divine 
ornaments and garlands, and who are also the experts in the methodical sex-games that seaside is pervaded. 

That seacoast is adored by the propitious wives of gods and frequented by the assemblages of gods who 
thrive upon ambrosia, and even patronised by demons that strive for ambrosia. 
It is spread with swans, ruddy-gees and frogs, and there the waterfowls are very noisy, and stones overlain 
on the coast are like lapis-gems, and with the ambience of ocean that whole delta is appearing smooth 
and sludgy. 
While Ravana, the brother of Kubera, is quickly transiting he saw everywhere the whitish and widish 
aircrafts belonging to the deified souls who acquired higher worlds, and from those aircrafts adorned 
with divine flowery tassels and piloted by the wish of their steersmen, instrumental and vocal music 
is resonating, and gandharva-s are singing and apsara-s are dancing in them. 
Ravana proceeded while observing thousands of woodlands with sandalwood trees that are soothing and 
satisfying the sense of smell, and that oozed sweet-smelling resin at their bases. 
He also observed on his way the forests and woodlands containing the noteworthy aloe plants, Takkola 
trees, and the nutmeg trees that are with fruits and aromatic, as well. 
Also seen are the flowers of Tamaala trees, shrubberies of pepper, and heaps of desiccating pearl-oysters 
along the seashore. 
Thus, he saw the peaking boulders, like that the reefs of corals, and like that also at the mountains 
that have golden and silvern crests. 
On seeing the delightful, serene, and marvellous cascades, and cities that are abundant in wealth and 
agricultural produce, and abundant with gemlike womenfolk, and that are replete with elephants, horses, 
and chariots, Ravana proceeded further. 
Ravana observed the delta adjacent to seacoast of that kingly ocean to be uniform and smooth, while 
the light air breezing in there is soft for touch, thus it looked heavenly. 
There Ravana also saw a banyan tree which in sheen is like a black-cloud, and the branches of which 
are stretching all over for a hundred yojana-s in length, and on which sages made their abode for practising 
ascesis. 
This is the tree on the branch of which once highly mighty Divine Eagle Garuda swooped to perch, clawing 
an elephant and a mammoth tortoise, for the purpose of dining them out on that tree-branch. 
While descending rapidly then that best bird among birds Garuda suddenly broke that tree's branch which 
is full with leaves, owing to the impact of his high impetuosity. 
Adhering to that tree-branch there are eminent sages like, Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s, 
Aja-s, and even sages like Dhuumraa-s that thrive on fumes and smokes are there, and there they are 
collectively practising asceticism upside down while clasping branches with their legs. 
For the sake of the grace of those sages Garuda took flight from that tree, grasping that broken tree-branch 
of a hundred yojana length along with those pendulous sages with his beak, and both of the elephant 
and tortoise with both of his claws. 
That virtue-souled Garuda consumed the meat of his prays, namely the elephant and the giant tortoise 
with a single foot, and destroyed the province of tribesmen with the same broken tree branch, and thus 
that supreme bird Garuda gained an incomparable happiness in rescuing those great-sages. 
When his valour has become twice as much with that happiness that heedful Garuda indeed resolved to 
bring ambrosia from heaven. 
Smashing the guard of iron-grid completely and crashing the unbreakable diamond -like strongroom in 
which the ambrosia is safeguarded, then Garuda carried off ambrosia from the palace of Indra. 
Ravana on his way saw such a banyan tree named as Subhadra which is a much sought after tree for assemblages 
of great sages, and which betokens the deeds of that best-winged Garuda. 
On going to the other side of the lord of rivers, namely ocean, Ravana saw a pleasing hermitage in the 
sacred and scenic interior of the forest. 
At that place Ravana saw the demon named Maareecha, wearing jute-clothes and black deerskin and tufts 
of hairs, and the one with regulated diet. 
That demon Maareecha welcomed the king Ravana and customarily entertained him catering all the offerings 
that are beyond the scope of humans. 
On personally offering meals and drinking water, and venerating him properly Maareecha spoke this sentence 
to Ravana which is connotative of significance. 
"Oh, king of the demons, is everything well with your Lanka? Oh, king, for what reason you have put 
in an appearance again, that too in a trice? 
When Maareecha spoke to him thus, that highly radiant and eloquent Ravana then afterwards spoke this 
sentence to Maareecha. Impelled by force of Destiny and with his red-blood eyes through anger due to
infatuation, that Ravana spoke to his charioteer as follows:
"O evil-minded fellow! Despising me as though I were bereft of manliness, incapable,
deficient in prowess, cowardly, petty-minded, devoid of energy, bereft of brilliance, deserted of
conjuring tricks and abandoned by mystic missiles, you are acting as per your discretion!"
"Why have you carried away this chariot of mine, thus humiliating me in the presence
of my enemies and overlooking my will?"
"O vulgar fellow! You have destroyed my fame which was earned through a long period,
prowess, vital power and the trust of people today."
"While my adversary, having an illustrious prowess and making others delightful
through feats of his valour, stood looking on, myself, who has an ardent desire for fighting and
who was made contemptible by you!"
"O evil-minded fellow! In case you do not, by perversity, carry away this chariot at
any event, this expectation of mine that you stand corrupted by the enemy, will be a fact."
"This act, which has been done by you, is only befitting of enemies. This is indeed
not the work of a friend, who wishes me well."
"If you inhabited with me in Lanka for a long time and if you remember my merit,
drive back the chariot swiftly till my enemy does not withdraw."
Hearing those harsh words of the foolish Ravana, the friendly-minded charioteer
spoke the following conciliatory words of Ravana:
"I was neither frightened nor I was stupid. I was not bribed by the enemies, nor was
I a blunderer. I was not disloyal to you. I have not forgotten the benefits conferred by you."
"An act which was not to your taste was done by me as something conducive to your
interest, by wishing well of you, for protecting your honour and with mind affectionately disposed
towards you through attachment."
"O monarch! Like somebody who is petty-minded and unworthy, you ought not to hold
me, devoted as I am to your pleasure and good, quilty in this matter."
"O monarch! Like somebody who is petty-minded and unworthy, you ought not to hold
me, devoted as I am to your pleasure and good, guilty in this matter."
"I understand your exhaustion, due to your strenuous fighting in the great battle. I
am not reflecting on the inclination of your valour or on your superiority over your enemy."
"The horses of my chariot were broken down and were exhausted by drawing the
chariot. They became miserable and thoroughly fatigued, like the cows lashed by heavy rain."
"I am seeing inauspiciousness in all the portents, which appear to us in large
numbers and duly examined by me."
"(Propitious and unpropitious) time and place, (good and bad) omens, facial as also
the strength and weakness of the warrior occupying the chariot must be ascertained (by a
charioteer)."
"The eminences and depressions of the ground as well as the parts which are level
and rugged, the time appropriate for the combat and the visible weak points of the enemy must be
known (by a charioteer)."
"How to arrive and retreat, how to hold one's position and to recede all this must
be known by a charioteer, seated in the chariot."
"This action appropriate was taken by me in order to give rest to you and to these
horses of the chariot as also to relieve your terrible fatigue."
"O the valiant lord! This chariot was not removed by me arbitrarily. That which was
done by me was because I was overwhelmed with affection for my master."
"O annihilator of enemies! O hero! Give me a command! I will do that which you will
enjoin me to do, with due attention and with a mind which feels relieved of all that is due."
Satisfied with the explanation given by his charioteer and applauding him in many
ways, Ravana who was avaricious of fighting, spoke the following words:
"O charioteer! Take this chariot quickly towards Rama. Ravana does not turn back in
battle, without killing his enemies."
Thus speaking Ravna the lord of demons was pleased and then presented a beautiful
and excellent ornament for the hand to him. That charioteer, after hearing Ravana's instruction,s
drove the chariot back to the battle-field.
Impelled by Ravana's command, that charioteer thereupon quickly drove the horses
forward. Then, that chariot of Ravana stood within a moment, before Rama's chariot on the
battle-field.When Maareecha spoke those acceptable and equitable words, Ravana rejected them like
a person with a death wish rejects medicament. 
Ushered by the Terminator the king of demons Ravana, uncouthly spoke these
unbefitting words to Maareecha who had been speaking conducive and beneficial words of advise.

"All these meaningless words that are being said to me are decidedly worthless, in
effect, like the seeds seeded in wastelands. 
"But it is impossible to scare me away from a war with that iniquitous and imprudent
Rama, that too, from a human being, with these words of yours. 
"He who bolted off to forest in a single-foot on hearing the artless words of a
woman, forfeiting his kingdom, friends and relatives, and even his mother, likewise his father too,
you cannot scare me away from such a Rama. 
"But his wife Seetha who is dearer to him more than his lives is certainly seizable
by me in association with you, as that Rama had purposelessly killed Khara in a war. 
"In this way my thinking is decided and it is lingering on in my heart, and it is
impossible to roll back my mind or heart even for Indra coming along with gods and demons.

"If you are asked about the credits or discredits, or either of the danger or
ideation of the deed for determining its modus operandi, it will be apt of you to talk like this,
but I did not seek any viewpoints of yours. 
"Even if someone is asked, and if he desires his own welfare, then he has to submit
his opinion to the king suppliantly upraising his palm-fold, may he be an intellectual, or an
astute adviser. 
"The king being lord of the land is to be addressed preceded with gentility, with
auspicious and beneficial words that do not contradict the interests of that lord, more so, they
shall be inclusive of etiquette. 
"Or else, oh, Maareecha, even if a beneficial word is said, but if it is said with
reprehension it will not gladden that king who insists upon honour, for that said word is
dishonourable, let alone reprehension. 
"The kings with infinite vigour embody five constituents forces of Fire, Moon, Rain,
Terminator, and that of Indra, the Administrator of Natural Forces. 
"Oh, nightwalker, thus the kings being great-souls personify the sultriness of Fire,
sternness of Indra, softness of Moon, suppleness of Rain, and harshness of Terminator, and
therefore in all situations they are respectable and reverential. 
"But you are ill-advisedly babbling with me in this way, incognizant of rectitude
and holding on to your obsession, and wishing ill of me, as I am on your doorstep. 
"Oh, demon, I did not ask the rights and wrongs concerning me, nor that which is
expedient for me, but oh, demon of untold bravery, I have said this much to you. 
" 'It will be apt of you to proffer a helping hand in this deed.' This much I said
to you. And such as you are you may now listen to that task which you have to undertake during the
course of your assistance as I detail it to you. 
"On becoming an amazing silver-potted golden deer you move in front of Seetha in the
hermitage of Rama, and on verily alluring Vaidehi you can go away as you like. 
"On seeing you as a wholly illusory golden deer curiosity arises in Vaidehi, and
indeed she tells Rama, 'bring that one quickly.' 
"Further, on Rama's coming out of his hermitage you go distantly and blurt out in
this way, 'ha Seetha' and even as, 'ha, Lakshmana,' mimicking Rama's voice. 
"On hearing that, and further hastened by Seetha, even Soumitri apprehensively
follows the path of Rama in all his fondness for Rama. 
"When Rama is diverted from hermitage, Lakshmana as well, I will carry off Vaidehi
effortlessly like the Thousand-eyed Indra who once carried off Sachi Devi. 
"Oh, demon, on carrying out this stint in this manner you may go as you like, and to
you oh, Maareecha with solemn vows, I will grant half of my kingdom. 
"Hence, oh, gentle one, get going on a trouble-free path for the easy achievement of
the task, and I for myself will follow you to Dandaka forest along with the chariot. 
"My goal will be achieved just by misleading Raghava, and by gaining Seetha without
a conflict, then I will proceed to Lanka along with you. 
"If you are not going to do so, oh, Maareecha, for sure I will kill you now itself.
I will get my work done through you even under duress, and indeed, any subject setting against his
king will never succeed safely. 
"Your life may be indefinite on reaching Rama, but your death is surely definite now
as you are conflicting with me. Hence, keeping all this in view you come to a conclusion that would
be conducive to your interests, and whatever desirable to you let it be done in that way. " Thus
Ravana spoke to Maareecha. Ravana, goaded by death, spoke the following harsh words to Vibhishana, who was very
stable and who had spoken wholesome words:
"One can stay together with an enemy or even with a furious snake, but one cannot
stay together with an adversary yet avowing himself as a friend"
"O, demon! I know the conduct of kinsmen in all the worlds. These kinsmen always are
rejoiced at the calamities of their kinsmen"
"O, demon! The kinsmen indeed insult and even humiliate their kinsman, who is an
effective leader, a person of education and right conduct and a valiant man."
"The horrible kinsmen with their concealed thoughts and treacherous minds, terrific
ones as they are, always rejoice each other in adversities."
"Previously in a forest called Padmavana, some maxims were spoken by elephants,
which saw men with nooses in hand. Hear and I shall tell them."
"For us, fire or weapons or nooses are not begetting fear. The terrific kinsmen,
incited by selfishness are begetting fear to us."
"These kinsmen will inform the strategy to our enemies to seize us. There is no
doubt about this. Out of all fears, the fear of kinsmen is very much troublesome for us. It is a
well known thing."
"There is wealth in cows. There is fear for kinsmen. There is fickleness in women.
There is austerity in Brahmins."
"O, gentleman! Hence, it is not of liking to you that the people are venerating me,
that I obtained riches and that I am sitting tight in the heads of enemies".
"As drops of water fallen on lotus leaves do not get clung to those leaves, so also
a friendship does not cling to vulgar ones."
"As rainy clouds in autumn, even though thundering, cannot get the earth saturated
with water, so also friendship does not have tenderness of heart in vulgar people."
"As a honey bee, even though getting nectar from a flower, does not stick on to that
flower due to its eager desire for more, you also belong to that category as friendship does not
stick on to vulgar people."
"As even though trying to drink nectar from a flower of grass, a honey bee cannot
get it, so also friendship cannot be extracted from vulgar persons."
"How an elephant abuses its body by helping itself with dust after taking bath
earlier with its trunk, friendship gets an abuse in vulgar persons in the same manner."
"O, demon, walking about by night! If any other person utters these words in this
manner, he will be ceasing to exit at this moment. O, destroyer of race! A curse upon you!"
Hearing those harsh words from Ravana, Vibhishana who advocates justice, wielding a
mace in his hand, soared high into the sky, along with four other demons.
Then, the illustrious Vibhishana who became angry also spoke these words to king
Ravana, his brother after moving into the sky.
"O, king! You are a brother to me. You utter whatever you like. Elder brother is
like a father. Even if he is not staying in a right path, he is to be respected. But I cannot
forbear these harsh words from you."
"Those who have an ill composed mind and who get conceded to the occasion do not
assimilate the words of prudence, spoken by a well wisher."
"O, king! Men who forever speak pleasing words are easy to be obtained. But one who
speaks of useful but unpleasing words as also the one who listens to them, are rare to be
obtained"
"I could not ignore you, being destroyed by the noose of Yama (god of death); tied
around you and which snatches away all beings, as none can ignore a burning house."
"I do not wish to see you, being killed by Rama with his sharp arrows, adorned with
gold and each resembling like a blazing fire."
"Persons who are valiant, strong and skilled in weaponry, when time comes, sink down
(ruin) as a dam constructed with sand sinks down."
"As an elder brother, bear the words spoken by me, who desire your welfare. Guard
this city and yourself along with demons, by all means. Let all be well with you. I am departing.
Be a happy person without me."
"O, Ravana the ranger of the night! My words are not relishing to you, who are being
restrained by me duly desiring your welfare. Persons whose duration of life is to end, do not
accept the salutary words spoken by their well wishers"Beholding those foremost of monkey leaders pointed out by Shuka- the most valiant
Lakshmana; Rama's right arm, his own brother Vibhishana standing close to Rama, the terribly
powerful Sugreeva the king of all monkeys, the strong Angada grandson of Indra the wielder of
thunderbolt, the powerful Hanuman, the imincible Jambavan, Sushena, Kumuda, Nila, Nala the
excellent of monkeys, Gaja, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Mainda and Dvivida- that Ravana - his heart became
agitated a little, was enraged and then abused those two heroes Shuka and Sarana who had completed
their report.
Ravana spoke (the following) excited and harsh words, in a voice choked in anger to
Shuka and Sarana who stood saluting with their faces bent down.
"It is not befitting to utter unpleasant words by dependent ministers to their king
who has the power to mete out any punishment or reward."
"Is it proper for both of you to shower irrelevant praise on our enemies who are
adverse to us and are approaching for a war?"
"In vain have you sat at the feet of your elders, your preceptors and the aged,
since the essence to be followed from political sciences has not been grasped by both of you."
"Or if you have imbibed them, you have not remembered them. You are over-burdened
with ignorance! Being associated with such foolish ministers, it is a miracle that I am still able
to retain my sovereignty."
"Have you no fear of death that you dare address me thus rudely, I whose tongue that
you dare tongue dispenses good and evil?"
"Trees may survive in the forest, even if disturbed by fire. But the guilty cannot
survive, if touched by the royal scepter."
"If my anger is not softened by the services they rendered earlier, I would have
killed thse two miscreants who are praising the band of enemies."
"Keep away from my neighbourhood. Do not be seen anywhere here. I am recollecting
your past services and hence do not wish to kill you. Both of you, who are ungrateful and
unfaithful towards me, are just as dead to me."
Hearing Ravana's words, Shuka and Sarana felt ashamed to see Ravana paid obeisance
to him saying, "Be thou victorious!" and went away.
The demon Ravana spoke to Mahodara who was standing nearby as follows: "Bring me the
spies here quickly."
Hearing those words, Mahodara immediately ordered for the spies. The spies came
hurriedly as per the orders of the king, paid obeisance to him by joining their palms and
approached him, having made a complement expressing their desire to see him victorious.
Then, Ravana the king of demons spoke the following words to those spies, who were
faithful, brave, energetic and free from fear:
"You go from here to investigate about the first impression concerning Rama, as
regards who are his intimate friends and in respect of those who joined on his side with a liking
towards him."
"Find out what are his hours of sleeping and waking and what he intends to do next.
You ought to come here, after acquainting with all this information completely and skillfully."
"An enemy in battle, got known through spies by kings, will be defeated with only a
little of effort."
Those spies on their part delightfully replied, "May it be so", kept Shardula in
their front and made their circumambulation clockwise around Ravana.
Having thus made circumambulation to Ravana the excellent and the distinguished
demon, the spies went to the place where Rama along with Lakshmana were there.
Having gone in a disguised manner, those spies saw Rama and Lakshman together with
Sugreeva and Vibhishana in the neighbourhood of Mountain Suvela.
Seeing that army, those demons became overwhelmed with fear. However, they were
observed by the high-souled Vibhishana the Lord of demons.
Accidentally, the deomons there were caught by Vibhishana, who said that the demon
Shardula among them was wicked and got him alone seized.
That Shardula also, who was going to be killed by the monkeys, was got released by
Rama. The other demons also were got released by Rama, the kind man.
Those demons, harassed by the courageous and the quick-paced monkeys, became
insensible, heaved a sigh and reached back Lanka.
Those spies, who always wander outside and who were valiant rangers of the night,
thereafter approached Ravana and informed him that Rama's army was camping in the vicinity of the
Suvela mountain.When that missile was made defunct, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, doubled
his fury and in his anger, began to employ another missile immediately.
Ravana, who was endowed with extraordinary splendour, started to release another
cruel and terrific missile built by Maya the demon, on Rama.
Then, from that bow, came forth, blazing pikes, maces and clubs, which were hard as
adamant, on all sides.
Various kinds of furious mallets, deceptive nooses and blazing thunderbolts came
forth, like piercing gales at the time of the destruction of the world.
The glorious Rama, the foremost among the knower in the use of excellent missiles
and who was endowed with extra ordinary splendour, struck down that missile with an excellent
missile presided over by Gandharvas the celestial musicians.
When that missile was made defunct by the great souled Rama, Ravana with his coppery
eyes in anger, employed a missile presided over by the sun-god.
Then came forth resplendent and large discuses, from the bow of that intelligent
Ravana, of terrific impetuosity.
Even as they came forth and falling on all sides, the sky was blazing and the
quarters illuminated, as by the moon, the sun and other planets.
In the forefront of Ravana's army, that Rama split those discuses and other strange
weapons, with a multitude of arrows.
Seeing that missile struck down, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, pierced
Rama with ten arrows in all his vital parts.
Eventhough that Ravana struck Rama with those ten arrows released from his great
bow, Rama of extraordinary energy was not shaken.
Then, Rama the victorious in battle, was quite enraged and struck Ravana in all his
organs with a multitude of arrows.
In the meantime, the mighty and enraged Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, the
destroyer of valiant enemies, seized hold of seven arrows.
Lakshmana of great brilliance, with those arrows of high velocity, tore off into
many pieces, the flag-staff of Ravana, which bore the emblem of a man's head.
The glorious and mighty Lakshmana, with a single arrow, tore the head of Ravana's
charioteer, which was adorned with blazing ear-rings.
With five sharp arrows, Lakshmana then chopped off Ravana's bow, which looked like
an elephant's trunk.
Bouncing forward, Vibhishana killed, with his mace, the excellent horses of Ravana,
which looked like black clouds and were tall as mountains.
Leaping down with speed from his large chariot, whose horses had been killed, Ravana
then exhibited a violent anger towards the younger brother of Rama.
Then, Ravana, of great energy and prowess, hurled a spear looking like a blazing
thunderbolt, on Vibhishana.
Even before the spear reached Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it with three of his arrows
and a loud cheer then arose from the monkeys in the battle-field.
That gold-crowned spear, torn into three pieces, fell like a large meteor with
sparks of fire falling from the sky.
Thereupon, Ravana took hold of another large most competent spear, which was
difficult to be approached even by Yama the lord of Death and blazing as it was, with its own
splendour.
The mighty and the evil-minded Ravana swiftly hurled that very great spear, burning
with a radiance similar to that of a blazing thunder-bolt.
In the meanwhile, the valiant Lakshmana quickly rushed towards that Vibhishana, who
got a danger to his life.
To rescue that Vibhishana, the heroic Lakshmana, having stretched his bow, threw out
streams of arrows on Ravana who was holding a spear in his hand.
Poured in with a multitude of arrows discharged by the great-souled Lakshmana,
Ravana with his attach frustrated, did not make up his mind to attack Vibhishana further.
Seeing Vibhishana his brother rescued by Lakshmana, that Ravana, turning his face
towards Lakshmana spoke the following words:
"O Lakshmana, exalter of your own strength! As Vibhishana was rescued by you in this
way, this spear, on letting off Vibhishana the demon, is being hurled on you now."
"This spear, having blood-marks and hurled by bludgeon-like arm, having pierced your
heart, will depart only after taking your life."
Thus saying, the greatly enraged Ravana roared and hurled towards Lakshmana, that
unfailing spear, which was adorned with eight loudly clamouring bells, which had been designed by
Maya the demon by dint of his conjuring trick, capable of destroying adversaries and blazing as it
was with splendour.
That spear, with a sound equal to Indra's thunder-bolt, hurled by the terribly swift
Ravana, soon fell with speed on Lakshmana in the battle-front.
Rama repeatedly uttered to that spear even as it was rushing forth (on Lakshmana) as
follows: "May it be well with Lakshmana! May you prove useless! May your effort be frustrated!"
That spear, which was looking like a venomous serpent, released by the enraged
Ravana in the battle, quickly penetrated the bosom of Lakshmana, who stood fearless.
That spear, like the tongue of Vasuki (the lord of serpents), blazing with a great
dazzle, fell on the broad chest of Lakshmana, with enormous speed.
Penetrated very deeply and pierced through his heart by the spear due to the force
exerted by Ravana, Lakshmana fell to the ground.
Seeing Lakshmana in that state, Rama, of extraordinary splendour, who was stationed
in the vicinity, became sorrowful at heart because of the love towards his brother.
Rama, whose eyes were filled with tears, reflected just for a while and then was
very much enraged, like fire at the time of dissolution of the world.
Becoming aware that it was not the time for feeling despondent, and looking at
Lakshmana, Rama resumed that highly tumultuous battle with a great and whole-hearted endeavour,
determined as he was to destroy Ravana.
Then, Rama saw Lakshmana, who was struck by the spear in that Great War, bathed as
he was in blood and looking like a mountain with a snake (entering its centre).
Even with an exertion to pull out that spear hurled by the mighty Ravana, those
foremost of the monkeys could not those foremost of the monkeys could not do it because they were
being tormented by Ravana the foremost of demons with a stream of his arrows.
Penetrating through Lakshmana's bosom, that spear touched the earth. Seizing hold of
awful spear with his hands, the mighty Rama drew it out and getting enraged, broke it during the
course of the battle.
While Rama was drawing the spear out; arrow, which pierced his vital organs, were
sunk by the mighty Ravana on all his limbs.
Ignoring those arrows and having embraced Lakshmana, Rama spoke to Hanuma and
Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, as follows:
"O the chiefs of monkeys! Remain just encompassing Lakshmana. Let this malicious
Ravana of evil designs be killed. The time to manifest my prowess, which I have been wishing for
long, has come, as for a chataka bird, the site of a cloud would come, as sought by it, at the end
of a hot season."
"I take this vow in truth before you, at this moment, O monkeys, that without delay,
you will see the world devoid of Ravana or Rama (myself)."
"I encountered with the loss of sovereignity, the dwelling in the forest, the
wandering around in the woods of Dandaka and the rough treatment of Seetha by the demons."
"A great and terrible suffering has happened to me and an agony equivalent to hell.
Now, by killing Ravana in battle, I will relieve myself of all that agony."
"That sinful demon, for whose sake, this army of monkeys has been brought by me,
Sugreeva has been anointed on the throne after killing Vali and for whose sake the ocean has been
crossed and a bridge built on it, has come within the range of my sight in the battle-field
now."
"This Ravana, having come within the range of my vision, cannot survive, any more
than the one who has come within the range of vision of a snake injecting deadly poison with its
very glance or than a serpent who has come within the range of vision of Garuda, the king of birds
and the enemy of serpents."
"O the foremost of the monkeys who are so difficult to conquer! Seated on the
mountain-peaks, you witness at ease, this battle between myself and Ravana."
"Let the three worlds (viz. the earth, heaven and the intermediate region) including
Gandharvas the celestial musicians, the gods, the sages and the celestial bards see today the
Ramahood of Rama during the course of my battle."
"I shall perform today a feat, which people in the world including all living beings
both mobile and immobile, as also gods, will ever narrate together, describing how the battle
proceeded, as long as the earth is able to support those who occupy it."
Thus speaking, Rama with an attentive mind in the battle-field, struck Rama with
sharp arrows, decked in pure gold.
Thereupon, Ravana streamed forth blazing steel arrows and then clubs, as clouds
would stream forth the rains.
A tumultuous sound arose from the excellent arrows, released by Rama and Ravana, as
they struck each other.
The arrows of Rama and Ravana, split asunder and scattered off, with their blazing
points, fell from the space on to the surface of the earth.
The loud sound, produced by the impact of the bow-string on the palms of those two
heroes Rama and Ravana, which struck terror in all the living beings, was felt astonished by the
audience.
Torn asunder by the streams of a multitude of arrows by the great-souled Rama, who
was armed with a blazing bow, while coming in collusion with him, Ravana took to his heels out of
fear, like a cloud when pushed by a tempest."Give attention to my words as I speak, oh, sire, Maareecha, I am an anguished one,
and when I am in such an anguish you are the ultimate course to me, isn't so." Thus Ravana started
addressing Maareecha. 
"You are aware as to how my brother Khara, and the mighty armed Duushana, also my
sister Shuurpanakha, and even the highly fiery demon and devourer of raw-flesh Trishira, and even
numerous other night-walking demons who are cocksure of hitting their targets have made Janasthaana
as their residency, and while residing there they put the sages of that great forest that tread a
righteous path to torture, of course, all this as assigned by me. 
"You are equally aware of the stationing fourteen thousand braving demons in
Janasthaana, who are the followers of the wish of Khara, who are with fiendish exploits, and who
are the troublemakers to the sages of Dandaka forest or to the intruders therein, aren't you.

"But recently those great mighty demons that are the residents of Janasthaana,
namely Khara and others, preparing themselves inordinately and wielding diverse weapons and
assaulters, for their part had an encounter with Rama in a combat. 
"With rancour tiding in him, and without making any scathing remark in the least,
that Rama brought his bow into play with arrows in the van of the combat. 
"But that foot-soldier, that too, a human, has completely wiped out those
fourteen-thousand demons with flaring fieriness with his fierce arrows. 
"Khara is hewed down, Duushana is mowed down, and even Trishira is hacked down,
thereof that Dandaka forest is rendered free from the fear of demons. 
"He who is put to flight by his infuriated father, and who came to Dandaka forest
along with his wife, that ignoble Kshatriya is the slaughterer of that demonic army of mine, as his
lifespan is diminished. 
"He is out of character, brutal, firestorm, senseless, selfish, one with his senses
unconquered and righteousness discarded, and he is an unrighteous soul just delighting in the
disservice of all beings. 
"By whom my sister is disfigured stripping off her nose and ears, that too, without
any enmity but just depending upon his own brawn, I would like to inveigle such a man's nymphean
wife Seetha holding sway on her in Janasthaana, and in that matter I want you to be my aide in
Dandaka forest. 
"Oh, highly powerful Maareecha, with you and with my brothers standing by my side as
my associates, I indeed care a damn for all of the gods if they are going to wage a war against me,
therefore, oh, demon Maareecha, as you are capable of rendering aid you should indeed become my
aide in this venture. 
"In valour, war and verve there is none similar to you, you are a topmost stalwart
in trickery, and a matchless expert in illusive-tricks. 
"I have come nigh of you only for that reason, oh, nightwalker, and listen to that
deed which you have to do in the course of helping me as I detail you. 
"On becoming an astounding golden deer with silver dots, you move in front of Seetha
in the hermitage of that Rama. 
"On seeing you in the shape of a deer, Seetha undoubtedly bids her husband
forthwith, and even Lakshmana, saying, 'lay hold of it.' 
"Then on the diversion of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, I will comfortably and
unimpededly abduct Seetha in that lonely place, as planet Rahu abducts the shine of moon.

"Thereafter Rama will be enervated by the abduction of his wife, and then surely and
conveniently I wish to retaliate him if he is going to come up against me, for my inner-soul will
be firstly gratified with its volition, namely possessing Seetha." Thus Ravana requested Maareecha.

On listening the very word of Rama that honest-souled Maareecha's mouth is
completely dried up, and he is fully frightened. 
Wetting dried up lips with his tongue he has become goggle-eyed almost like an
about-to-die animal, and he agonisingly looked up at Ravana with winkless eyes. 
Maareecha's heart sank with scare as he is aware of Rama's valour when he was in the
great forest of Tataka, thus suppliantly making palm-fold he started telling about factuality of
Rama to Ravana, which is beneficial both to Ravana and to himself, as well, if only Ravana is
heedful of it. Returning to the City of Lanka, Ravana the King of Demons was afflicted with the
fear of Rama's arrows, his pride was humbled and his senses troubled.
The king was overcome by the high-souled Rama, like an elephant is by a lion or a
serpent by an eagle.
The Lord of Demons was maddened in recollecting Rama's arrows resembling the Rod of
Brahma the Lord of creation and possessed of the splendour of lightning.
Resting on an excellent and charming throne made of gold, Ravana looked at the
demons and spoke the following words:
"All that great penance performed by me became a waste indeed, for, I who am equal
to Mahendra the Lord of Celestials have been defeated by a mere man!"
"The terrible words of Brahma the Lord of Creation saying, 'You know of the threat
from men' appear true. That is so."
"I sought immunity from death at the hands of celestials, titans or celestials
musicians, or semi divine beings or demons or serpent-demons, but f man I made no mention."
"Rama the son of Dasaratha is the man I think of whom Anaranya born of Ikshvaku
dynasty formerly spoke, saying: 'O, the worst of demons, the worst of your race and the wretched
one! In my race will be born a man who will slay you in battle with your sons, ministers, army,
horses and charioteer."
"Further, I was formerly cursed by Vedavati when she was humiliated by me. The same
Vedavati is born as the highly fortunate Seetha the daughter of Janaka."
"What was predicted by Parvati the consort of Shiva, Nandishvara the attendant of
Shiva, Rambha the wife of Nalakubara and Punjikasthala the daughter of Varunda has come to pass!
The words of the sages never prove false."
"On account of all this and admitting it, you should exert yourselves to the
uttermost. Let the demons go to the summit of Charya Mountain."
"Awaken that kumbhakarna, who is without equal in prowess, who humbles the pride of
the celestials and demons, and on whom the curse of Brahma the Lord of creation rests."
Having known that Prahasta being slain and knowing himself to have been defeated in
the battle, Ravana issued his commands tot he dreadful army, saying:
"Guard the gates with utmost care. Man the ramparts. Rouse Kumbhakarna who is
slumbering soundly."
"Kumbhakarna is sleeping happily, his understanding vitiated by lust and free from
all anxieties. The demon sleeps for nine, seven, ten or eight months.
"Having deliberated with me nine days ago, he has since fallen asleep. Awaken
quickly that mighty Kumbhakarna."
"The mighty armed Kumbhakarna, the foremost of all demons will kill the monkeys and
the two princes at once in the battle."
"This Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the demons and a great mark in the battle,
being fond of a rustic comfort, is always sleeping stupidly."
"If Kumbhakarna is awaken, there will be no worry for me, who stand defeated by Rama
in this highly terrific battle."
"What is the use of him, who possessing a strength equal to that of Indra the Lord
of celestials, cannot help me in such a dreadful catastrophe?"
Hearing those words of Ravana, those demons very briskly went to the abode of
Kumbhakarna.
Entering the beautiful cave of Kumbhakarna, with a large door, having an area of a
Yojana on all sides and bearing a floral perfume, the demons of mighty strength, though shaken off
by Kumbhakarna's breaths, remained stable forcefully with difficulty and went into the cave.
Entering that beautiful cave inlaid with diamonds and gold, those tigers among
demons beheld Kumbhakarna, of terrific prowess, who was sleeping.
They together tried to awaken Kumbhakarna who was sleeping nastily like a spread-out
mountain in a great slumber.
His limbs covered with down which stood on end, breathing like a serpent, as he
slept, Kumbhakarna of irresistible valour emitted dreadful snores, his nostrils being horrible, and
his mouth a gaping hell. Stretched to his full length on the earth, he gave forth an odour of
marrow and blood, his limbs were adorned with golden armlets and he wore a diadem as bright as the
sun, thus did that lion among demons, Kumbhakarna, the slayer of his foes, appear!
Then, those powerful demons, in order to satisfy him, placed a heap of venison as
high as Mount Meru, in front of Kumbhakarna.
Those excellent demons piled up a great mass of wonderful food with the meat of
deers, buffaloes and pigs.
Then, the demons placed pots of blood and various kinds of meat in front of
Kumbhakarna.
They rubbed Kumbhakarna the scourge of his foes with the most rare sandalwood and
refreshed him with celestial and fragrant garlands as well as sweet-smelling perfumes.
They burnt incenses and hymned the praises of that warrior who proved fatal to his
foes. They cried out noises which burst forth on every side like thunder.
They blew couches which were as bright as the moon and with impatience, made with
impatience, made sounds tumultuously all at once.
Those demons made sounds by clapping their hands, in order to awaken Kumbhakarna and
shook him too, creating a great clamour.
The birds passing through the sky ran helter-shelter and fell down soon on hearing
the sounds of the couches, drums, gongs, clapping of hands and leonine roars.
As the illustrious Kumbhakarna did not waken from his slumber despite those great
sounds, all troops of demons seized hold of bars, pestles and maces towards him.
Then, the cruel demons struck that sleeping Kumbhakarna on his chest with
mountain-tops, pestles, maces, hammers and their fists.
Even with all their strength, the demons could not stand upright before the
breathing winds of Kumbhakarna, the demon.
Then, the terribly strong demons firmly seated themselves round him and began to
beat drums, cymbals, kettle-drums and myriads of couches and trumpets.
Ten thousand demons surrounded him all at once. Beating that colossus who resembled
a heap of antimony, the demons on their part tried to rouse him by making sounds. Even then, he did
not wake.
As they were unable to rouse him by these means, they resorted to more energetic and
ruthless methods.
They beat horses, camels, donkeys, and elephants with sticks whips and thongs, so
that they trample upon him and blasted kettle-drums, couches and drums.
They crushed his limbs under piles of heavy logs and pillars, as also maces lifted
with all their strength.
The entire Lanka, with its mountain and groves, was filled with great noise. He
nevertheless did not wake.
Then, they beat a thousand drums all around with sticks of refined gold.
Yet, as he did not wake from his profound slumber, being under the spell of a curse,
the demons were enraged.
All those demons of terrible strength were filled with a great fury. Some others
assembled their strength to awaken that demon.
Some beat drums, some shouted, some tore out his hair and some others bit his
ears.
Some poured hundreds of pitchers of water into his ears but Kumbhakarna, plunged in
deep sleep, did not stir.
Some strong ones, armed with rocks and hammers, struck the rocks and hammers on his
head, chest and other limbs.
Though smitten by missiles fastened with ropes on all sides, the giant bodied demon
did not wake.
A thousand elephants ran up and down on his body till Kumbhakarna lightly woke up
and became aware of the pressure.
Being insensible to those violent blows of crags and trees hurled upon him, but
under the prompting of extreme hunger, Kumbhakarna suddenly sprang up from sleep, yawning due to
loss of sleep.
Waving his arms resembling serpent's coils or the peaks of mountains, hard as cut
diamonds, that demons opening his monstrous month like unto the face of a submarine fire,
yawned.
His mouth yawning horribly resembled hell and appeared like the sun rising under the
high peak of Meru Mountain.
That mighty demon, being awake, yawned, heaving a sigh, like unto a tempest arising
from a mountain.
That figure of Kumbhakarna, rising up, stood out resembling Time at the dissolution
of the world, prepared to devour all beings.
His huge eyes, resembling flames of fire, with a glitter equal to that of lightning,
appeared like great blazing planets.
Then, the demons pointed to various kinds of victuals, boar and buffalo. The mighty
Kumbhakarna devoured them.
Then, the hungry Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, ate the meat and being thirsty
drank the blood and gulped pitchers full of fat and wine.
Thereupon, knowing that Kumbhakarna was gratified of his hunger, the demons
approached him, saluting him with their heads bent and surrounded him on all sides.
Raising his eyelids that were heavy with sleep, his gaze still veiled, he directed
his glance towards those demons and spoke as follows:
That excellent demons kindly addressing all the demons and surprised at being
roused, spoke the following words to the demons:
"For what reason have you thus wakened me so suddenly? Is all well with the king or
anything in peril here?"
"Surely, there must be some great danger from an external source since you have
wakened me in haste."
"Now, I shall drive away the misfortune from Ravana the King of Demons, even if I
have to cut Mahendra himself to pieces or to freeze the Fire.
"For a petty reason, one does not indeed awaken, one such as I, from my slumber.
Hence, tell me frankly, for what reason you have roused me."
Yupaksha, a minister of the King, with his hands joined salutation, spoke (as
follows) to Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of his enemies, thus talking excitedly.
"O, Prince! There is no threat whatsoever at anytime for us from celestials but a
mere man is driving us back by a tumultuous tremor."
"O, Prince! It is not indeed the celestials or demons who have put us in such a
peril as it comes to us from a man."
"Monkeys, whose forms are as large as mountains, are besieging Lanka. There is a
tumultuous peril for us from Rama, who is furious on account of Seetha's abduction."
"Already, a single monkey set fire to our great city of slew the youthful Prince
Aksha with his escort of elephants and retinue."
" ' Get thee hence' were the words addressed by Rama who is equal to the sun in
splendour, to Ravana in person the Lord of Demons and the trouble-some person to celestials."
"That which this king never suffered at the hands of Gods or Demons or Danavas, he
has had to endure here from Rama, who released him from the danger to his life."
Hearing about the humiliation of his brother in the battle through the words of
Yupaksha, Kumbhakarna rolling his great eyes, spoke to Yupaksha (as follows):
"O, Yupaksha! Now itself, after conquering the entire army of monkeys with Lakshmana
and Rama on the battle-field, then only I shall see Ravana."
"I shall satiate the demons with the flesh and blood of monkeys and, as for Rama and
Lakshmana, I shall drink their blood myself."
Hearing these haughty from that demon, whose anger increased his ferocity, Mahodara
the chief of warriors of demons, having offered obeisance with joined palms, spoke the following
words:
"O, the mighty armed! When you have listened to the words of Ravana and considered
the advantages and disadvantages of the matter, even afterwards you can conquer the enemies in
battle."
Hearing the words of Mahodara, the might Kumbhakarna of great valour prepared to
depart, surrounded by demons.
The demons, having awaken that sleeping Kumbhakarna of dreadful eyes, form and
valour, went to the King's palace in haste.
All those demons, approaching Ravana who was seated on the throne, said to him with
joined palms, as follows:
"O, Lord of Demons! Kumbhakarna, your brother, has wakened. Is it your will that he
should enter the battle field from there itself or do you desire him to come here and see you?"
Ravana answered those demons who stood before him and with a glad heart, said: "I
want to see him here. Bring him after extending the honours due to him in a befitting manner."
Uttering "Be it so", all those demons as commanded by Ravana, returned to
Kumbhakarna and spoke the following words:
"The king, the lion of all the demons, desires to see you. Go and gratify your
brother!"
Hearing his brother's wish, Kumbhakarna the inviolable demon of great prowess,
uttering "so be it", leapt up from his couch.
Washing his face and bathing, refreshed and delighted, adorning himself well and
feeling thirsty, he hastened them to bring him a drink which can boost up his strength.
Thereupon, those demons brought him quickly the wine and various kinds of eatable
there, in their hurry to take Kumbhakarna with them as per Ravana's commands.
Having drunk two thousand pitchers, Kumbhakarna prepared to set out and slightly
inebriated and flushed, he was exhilarated and filled with energy.
The fuming Kumbhakarna, going to his brother's palace along with the army of demons,
appeared like Yama the Lord of Death at the end of all-destroying Time. He caused the earth to
tremble with his foot-steps, while marching.
The royal high way was illumined by his body, like unto that orb of a thousand rays
(the sun) by its flashes illumines the earth and he went there, surrounded by a circle of demons
paying obeisance, resembling Indra the Lord of Celestials approaching the abode of Brahma the Lord
of Creation.
Seeing that slayer of his foes on the royal high way, that monster as high as the
peak of a mountain, those monkeys stationed outside the city, as also their leaders, were
frightened suddenly.
Some gained refuge in Rama who affords protection, some fell down tottering, some
fled away perturbed in all directions and some others lay on the ground, confounded with fear.
Seeing that colossus appearing like a great peak, having a diadem who seemed to
touch the sun with his brilliance, the monkeys were seized with terror and had grown immensely in
size, fled hither and thither.
Coming to know that the chief minister's sons were killed by the high souled who had 
cleverly concealed the expression made an excellent thought.
That Ravana ordered (as follows) five foremost leaders of the army viz. Virupaksha, Yupaksha, 
Durdhara the demon, Praghasa and Bhasakarna, all of them brave demons, skilled in strategy, eager to 
capture Hanuma and equal to the speed of wind in battle.
He ordered as follows: "March, all of you O generals, taking a large army together that 
monkey be punished."
"Approaching that monkey, you ought to become diligent. Action should be taken by you 
which is not out of accord with time and space."
"Judging him by his actions, I do not think of him as a mere monkey. By all means, he may 
be an evil spirit, putting on an extraordinary might."
"This evil spirit may be some being evolved for our sake by Indra the Lord of celestials 
with a strength of his askesis. Celestials, demons, and sages along with Nagas the serpent-demons, Yakshas 
the spirits and Gandharvas the celestials musicians were conquered by me along with you all together. 
Even the same offensive surely will be effected by them. It is such an evil spirit created by Indra. 
There is no doubt about it. Let it be captured forcibly. This monkey of a great prowess should not be 
despised by you."
"Earlier, I saw the monkeys of great prowess like Vali and Sugreeva, the mighty Jambavan, 
Nila the Chief of the army and so on like Dvivida. Their scheme of performance is not so fearful as this; 
nor their efficacy, nor their prowess, nor their intellect, nor this capacity to change their form or 
energy at will."
"Keeping in view that it is a great evil spirit standing in the form of a monkey, exert 
a great effort and capture it."
"The three worlds including Indra, celestials, demons and humans are not fit to stand 
before you in the battlefield."
"Even then, the one who is skilled in strategy, desirous of a victory in a battle is 
to protect himself. Victory in a battle is indeed unreliable."
All of them, having a great strength and a blaze equal to that of fire, accepting the 
orders of their king and augmenting their strength with chariots, elephants in rut, horses of extra 
ordinary swiftness and various kinds of sharp weapons sallied forth with great speed.
Thereafter, those valiant demons saw that Hanuma the great monkey, encircled by his rays 
of splendour like a rising sun, shining, standing on the archy door-way, possessing enormous energy, 
strong mental disposition and colossal strength.
Immediately on seeing that Hanuma of great intellect, great swiftness and a gigantic 
body, all those demons, stationed in all quarters, attacked him with their terrific weapons from every 
side.
Durdhara discharged five sharp and fierce steel arrows with a lustre of black lily petals 
and yellow tops to descend into Hanuma's head.
Pierced in the head by those fire arrows, Hanuma leapt roaring into the sky, making the 
roar reverberating in all directions.
Then the mighty and the valiant Durdhara leapt into the sky with his chariot. Stretching 
his bow and throwing hundreds of sharp arrows, he attacked Hanuma.
Hanuma warded him off from showering the arrows on him in the sky, as the wind wards 
off a rainy cloud from raining at the end of a monsoon.
Thus afflicted by that Durdhara, Hanuma then emitted a roar once again and swiftly expanded 
his body.
Like a mass of lightning on a mountain, Hanuma instantaneously fell on Durdhara's chariot, 
by jumping up from far above with great speed.
Losing his chariot whose axle and pole had been broken and all his eight horses destroyed, 
Durdhara then dropped down, losing his life, to the ground.
Engrossed in anger to see his fallen on the ground, the inviolable virupaksha and Yupaksha, 
the annihilators of enemies, jumped up into the air.
Jumping up in the air all of a sudden those two demons struck me in the chest with their 
clubs that long-armed Hanuma standing in the clear sky.
Striking down the swiftness of those violent demons, the mighty Hanuma whose prowess 
is equal to that of Garuda the eagle, again descended onto the ground.
Approaching a sala tree and uprooting it, Hanuma the monkey killed those two valiant 
demons.
Getting to know all those mighty three killed by Hanuma, Praghasa with a great alacrity, 
forcefully attacked Hanuma. The valiant Bhasakarna, highly enraged, attacked taking a spear in his hand.
The two generals stood by the side of the illustrious Hanuma. Praghasa pierced Hanuma 
with a sharp-pointed spear and Bhasakarna attacked him with a dart.
With his limbs wounded by those two demons, Hanuma with his body-hair anointed by 
blood, became enraged, with his blaze similar to that of a rising sun.
Having plucked up the top of a mountain with its various animals serpents and trees, 
the heroic Hanuma the best among monkeys, killed those two demons.
When those five army generals were killed, Hanuma then destroyed the remaining 
army.
Like Indra the thousand-eyed god destroying the demons, Hanuma destroyed the horses by 
striking them with horses, the elephants with elephants, the warriors with warriors and the chariots 
with chariots.
The earth had its path-ways blocked on all sides with the elephants and the horses killed, 
with the demons killed and with the big chariots which had their axles broken.
Like Yama the Time-spirit waiting for the right moment for the destruction of the mortals, 
the heroic Hanuma, killing the eminent demons and the army generals with their troops and vehicles in 
the combat waited for the right moment at the archway.Hearing and sustaining that the five army generals along with their followers and vehicles 
were disposed of by Hanuma, Ravana looked at Aksha, his son, violent in combat and who was inclined 
to fighting as well as sitting in front of him.
Goaded by the looks of Ravana, the energetic Aksha, wielding a golden dotted bow, quickly 
sprang up, like a fire switched up by the foremost of brahmins in a sacrificial fire, by offering oblations 
to it.
Mounting a great chariot, having the splendour of a newly risen sun and overlaid with a 
protective armour of highly refined gold, that valiant chief of demons sallied forth towards that mighty 
monkey.
Aksha's chariot was earned through many kinds of his penances. It was shining with a 
protective armour of highly refined gold, adorned with a flag on a flag-staff studded with gems and 
yoked well with eight excellent horses, having speed equal to that of a mind.
That chariot was unassailable by celestials or demons. It moved without hindrance to 
any place. It shone like a sun and could move within the sky. It was well-conceived with a quiver, eight 
swords and tied with bells. It was orderly arranged with spears and lances in their respective places.
Then, Aksha having a prowess equal to that of celestials, came forth, mounting that chariot 
decorated with golden wreaths, having a brilliance of moon and sun, filled with every right thing and 
shining like rays of sun.
Aksha, filling the sky earth and its mountains with sounds of horses elephants and chariots, 
together with his army, approached the efficient Hanuma the great monkey, standing at the archy doorway.
Approaching that Hanuma, standing there readily to destroy mortals, similar to a fire 
that is to destroy the world, the yellow-eyed Aksha was bewildered, born of a surprise and looked to 
him with great esteem.
That Aksha, the mighty prince, assessing the swiftness of that high-souled Hanuma and 
his prowess about his adversaries as also his strength, increased his body more and more 
like the sun when the frost has faded away.
Understanding Hanuma's prowess to be unrestrainable and stable in battle, Aksha, 
exhibiting anger initially, became stable and mentally composed and incited Hanuma to battle by discharging 
three sharp arrows towards him.
Recognizing that Hanuma, as a haughty monkey, after having gallantly conquered his adversaries 
and accustomed to fatigue, that Aksha, grasping the bow and arrows in his hand, saw him with an excited 
mind.
Having a golden chain, a pair of armlets and charming earrings, Aksha of swift prowess, 
approached Hanuma. Their unmatched get-together in combat became a baffle to even the celestials and 
demons.
Seeing that battle between Hanuma and Aksha, the earth uproared. The sun did not shine 
brightly. The wind ceased to blow. The mountain shook. The sky made a reverberant sound. The ocean too 
was agitated.
Then, that eminent demon, who correctly knew how to fix his gaze on the target, to fit 
an arrow to the bow and to discharge it, hurled on Hanuma's head, three arrows which were well-painted, 
having golden shafts and feathers which resembled venomous serpents.
Oozing the blood from his wound caused by those arrows descended into his head (by Aksha), 
looking like the newly risen sun, his eyes bathed in blood rolling rapidly, Hanuma shone brightly like 
the sun is surrounded by a circle of rays, having the arrows as its rays.
Seeing in the battle that Aksha the prince, with his marvellous weapons and picturesque 
bow, that Hanuma the excellent one among Sugree's counsellors, was rejoiced and with an inclination 
to fight, grew in size.
That Hanuma, endowed with strength and prowess, resembling the sun appearing on a peak 
of Mandara mountain whose anger was increased, then burnt prince Aksha along with his army and 
vehicles, by the rays of fire emanating from his eyes.
That demon in the form of a cloud, raining down arrows, then wielding a bow in the form 
of a rainbow, soon discharged arrows at Hanuma standing in the form of a mountain, like a cloud showering 
rain on a high mountain.
Seeing that Aksha the prince, possessing an impetuous valour, endowed with enhanced splendour 
strength and vigour with a capacity to move within the sky like a cloud, coming to the battle, Hanuma 
roared with joy.
Boastful of his valour in battle because of his childish attitude, Aksha wit an enhanced 
fury and red-blood eyes approached Hanuma who was incomparable in battle, as an elephant approaching 
a well-covered with heaps of straw.
As Aksha forcefully discharged his arrows, Hanuma roared a sound of thunder and bounced 
quickly to the sky assuming a terrible sight, stretching out his arms and thighs.
That strong and valiant Aksha, the foremost among the demons, and the best among car 
warriors went chasing Hanuma who was flying upwards, diffusing arrows like a cloud showering hailstones 
on a mountain.
That valiant Hanuma, whose swiftness was equal to the mind and possessing impetuous valour 
in battle, rushing forth like wind in the space between one arrow and another and thus escaping aksha's 
arrows moved in the path visited by wind (the sky).
With a respectful faculty of sight, Hanuma saw that Aksha who was wielding his bow and 
readily inclined to fight, covering the entire sky with excellent arrows with various types of tops 
and became thoughtful.
Then, the mighty-armed Hanuma, who knew how to act under particular circumstances, roaring 
when pierced in the breast with shafts by the high souled heroic, Aksha, reflected on the prowess of 
his adversary in battle.
"The mighty Aksha, possessing the lustre of a rising sun, is performing a great act, 
as a mature youth. My mind is not conceding here to kill him, who is distinguished in all acts of warfare."
"He possesses a great intellect and is also prominent by his valour. He is well-composed 
and highly tolerant in battle. Due to his eminent deeds and virtues, he is undoubtedly adored by saints, 
Nagas the serpent-demons and Yakshas the semi-divine being."
"He is standing very much before me and looks me straight in the eyes, reassured as he 
is, by his prowess and enthusiasm. His swift-moving prowess trembles even the minds of celestials and 
demons."
'If neglected, he would undoubtedly overpower me. His prowess is getting augmented in 
battle. The only option left for me is to kill him now. It is not proper to neglect a spreading fire."
The valiant and mighty Hanuma, reflecting thus about the swiftness of the adversary 
and determining his course of action, then acquired a course of action, then acquired momentum 
and also made up his mind to kill him.
That Hanuma, the heroic son of the wind, killed using the blows of his palm, those eight 
horses possess a great speed in the path of the sky with alertness and also have the capacity to bear the burden 
while turning in different directions.
Then, the great chariot of Aksha, thus struck by the palm and subdued by Hanuma the counsellor 
of Sugreeva, had its interior broken, its carriage pole loosened and its horses dead and fallen from 
the sky to the ground.
Leaving the chariot, wielding the bow and sword, Aksha the chariot warrior leapt 
to the sky. Having a terrible power of penance and leaving his body like a sage, he then was seen departing 
to heaven because of his Yogic penance.
Thereafter, Hanuma with his prowess equal to that of wind, approaches Aksha moving in 
the sky, which is often frequented by Garuda the eagle, the wind and Siddhas the ascetics endowed with 
supernatural powers slowly grasped his feet firmly.
That Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of the wind god, his father, and the excellent 
one among monkeys, spinning around Aksha like grasping a great serpent an eagle for a thousand times 
in the battle, hurled him down to the floor rapidly.
With his arms, thighs, hips and neck broken, blood dripping, his bones and eyes crushed, 
his joints displaced and his sinews shattered, that demon was killed by Hanuma.
Hanuma, having crushed him on the ground, created a great fear for Ravana. Aksha, thus 
having been killed, Hanuma was gazed on with excessive astonishment by great sages who moved everywhere 
without obstruction and having great voes as also by spirits Yakshas the semidivine beings, Pannagas 
the serpent-demons and by celestials with Indra the lord of celestials.
Killing that Aksha, possessing a lustre equal to that of Jayanta the son of Indra the 
lord of celestials and having his eyes resembling blood, the heroic Hanuma reached the same archy door 
way again, like Yama the lord of death expecting in a moment any mortal getting destroyed by him.Filled with anger about his son Aksha having been killed by Hanuma, yet reconciling his 
mind, the high-minded Ravana the king of demons for his part then instructed Indrajit (his eldest son) 
possessing the qualities of god (as follows):
"You are well acquainted with mystic missiles. You are the foremost among those who are 
conversant with weapons. You cause anguish even to celestials and demons. Indra and other celestials 
perceived your performance with your missiles acquired by propitiating Brahma the creator."
"Celestials together with troops of storm-gods joining Indra the lord of celestials were 
not able to endure the strength of your missiles in battle."
"In a battle against you, everyone in the three worlds gets exhausted. You are protected 
yourself by your great intellect and strong arms. You are guarded by your penance. You are aware of 
apportioning place and time properly."
"There is nothing impossible for you in your acts of war. With your purposeful thinking, 
everything is possible for you. There is none in the three worlds, who does not know the force of missiles 
as also your (physical) strength."
"The strength of your penance as also your prowess and strength in battle resemble mine. 
Admitting you in the squeeze of battle, my mind does not get fatigued because of the re-assurance."
"All the Kimkaras, a demon called Jambumali, the heroic sons of ministers, and the five 
chiefs of the army have been killed, as also the army together with a highly abundant number of horses, elephants 
and chariots."
"Your beloved brother Aksha the prince also has been killed. O annihilator of enemies! 
The strength which is in me or you is indeed not there in them at all."
"O intelligent one! Seeing the great strength, power, and prowess of this monkey and keeping 
in view your strength, exhibit your valor accordingly."
"Keeping in view your strength and of the army, O the foremost among those employing 
missiles, exert yourself in such a way, that further destruction of our army may stop, the moment you, 
whose enemies have died, have arrived near Hanuma."
"O hero! The armies cannot protect you, even if they are in multitudes. There is no use 
taking a weapon like a strong thunderbolt against the monkey. There is no limit to the strength of 
Hanuma the son of the wind god. It is not possible to kill him, who resembles fire, using any weapon."
"Perceiving well the fact in this way and with your mind composed by the thought that 
success can be achieved by your effort, and remembering the strength of arrows of your wonderful 
bow, go and duly proceed with your work, without any hindrance."
"This thought of my sending you is not indeed the best option. But, this decision is 
said to be according to the duties of a king and is the commendation of a warrior class."
"O destroyer of enemies! You have to learn surely the skill to employ various weapons 
in battle. You have to aspire for a victory too in battle."
Hearing the words of his father, Indrajit the strong demon, possessing a power similar 
to that of gods, with an undepressed mind and with his intellect resolved to fight, performed a circumambulation 
in honor of Ravana the lord.
Acclaimed by the beloved people of his class, Indrajit who was violent in battle 
then entered the battlefield with an accomplished enthusiasm.
Indrajit, the illustrious son of Ravana, has eyes like lotus petals and is endowed with 
extraordinary energy rushed forth like an ocean on full-moon days.
That Indrajit, alike Indra the lord of celestials, ascended a chariot with unchecked 
speed and yoked with four sharp-toothed tigers, having their swiftness similar to Garuda the king of 
eagles.
That Indrajit, the chariot-warrior, best among the wielders of bow, skilled in the use 
of weapons and excellent among those proficient in the use of missiles, went swiftly in his chariot 
to where Hanuma was.
Hearing the rattling sound of Indrajit's chariot and the twang of his bow, the heroic Hanuma 
became more thrilled with delight.
Indrajit, skilled in warfare, taking a very big bow with pointed arrows, went aiming 
towards Hanuma.
While Indrajit who was energetic in battle, was going ahead to the combat, with 
a bow in his hand, all the quarters became gloomy, and ferocious animals howled in many ways.
Nagas and Yakshas, great sages moving in astronomical circles, Siddhas and a multitude 
of birds going around the sky, gathered there and clamored loudly with great rejoicing.
Seeing Indrajit coming swiftly with the chariot, Hanuma made a noise with great resonance 
and grew up his body speedily.
Ascending on his wonderful chariot and wielding a colorful bow, Indrajit on his part, 
stretched his bow, which made a glaring sound like that accompanying a stroke of lightning.
Those two warriors, Hanuma and Indrajit, possessed great velocity and a great strength 
as also fearless in combat, confronted in battle like Indra the Lord of celestials, and Ravana the 
Lord of demons who tightened hostility with each other.
Hanuma, of immeasurable strength, having expanded his body, aborted the swiftness of 
arrows of that Indrajit, the great chariot-warrior, the wielder of a bow and well-renowned in battle. 
Hanuma wheeled about in the path of the wind god, his father.
Then, the heroic Indrajit, the destroyer of strong enemies, discharged long and sharp-pointed 
arrows, having beautiful feathers, provided with picturesque golden shafts, with good inclination and 
as swift as lightning.
Hearing the rattling sound of the chariot and the sound of wooden tomtoms, kettledrums, and war drums as well as the sound of the bow-string being plucked, Hanuma sprang up again.
Making the total target of Indrajit who was skilled in hitting his target useless, Hanuma 
the great monkey swiftly wheeled about between the arrows.
Hanuma, the son of the wind god, again stayed in front of his arrows and stretched out his 
hands sprang up.
Those two warriors, full of swiftness and skilled in their war-fare, staged an excellent 
battle, which captivated the minds of all beings.
Indrajit could not know the weakness of Hanuma, nor did Hanuma know the weakness of high-minded 
Indrajit. Those two warriors, who were equal in prowess to gods, coming into collision with each other, 
became unbearable to each other.
The aim of his arrows getting aborted and even his unfailing arrows falling, the 
high-minded Indrajit, who was well-known for hitting his target, got hold of a great thought.
Given that the monkey is incapable of being slain, Indrajit, Ravana's son 
then formed an idea as to how to resort to capture Hanuma the chief of monkey-warriors.
That warrior, Indrajit, excellent among the knowers of missiles and possessing a great 
splendor, then fitted to his bow, a missile presided over by Brahma the creator.
Indrajit, who knows the true nature of missiles, feeling certain that he was incapable 
of being killed, bound that Hanuma, the son of wind-god, who presided over by Brahma the creator.
Fastened with the weapon discharged by the demon, Hanuma became motionless and fell  
to the ground.
Realizing that he had been bound by a missile presided over by Brahma the Lord of creation 
that Hanuma failing to keep his swiftness, considered it to be a favor of Brahma the creator done to 
him.
Knowing it to be a missile presided over by Brahma the creator and consecrated by spells 
sacred to Brahma, the creator, Hanuma then recollected a boon got by Lord Brahma, the grandfather of 
the entire creation.
"I cannot liberate from the bondage of the missile due to the power of Brahma 
the father of the world. Thus knowing the bondage, through the missile presided over by Brahma the self-born 
creator imposed by the enemy, it must be obeyed by me."
Thinking of the potency of the missile and the grace of Brahma, the grandfather of the 
entire creation enjoyed by him, and thinking about his capacity to liberate from it (which was going 
to alight on him after a while) that Hanuma obeyed the command of Brahma the grandfather of the entire 
creation.
"Since I am being protected by Brahma, Indra, and the wind god, I do not have fear, even though 
I am fastened by the missile."
"Even if I were captured by the demons, a great advantage is foreseen. There will be 
a dialogue with Ravana. Therefore, let the enemies capture me."
That Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies and who acted after fully considering the pros 
and cons, ascertained his objective and stayed motionless. Approached and captured forcibly by the enemies 
as also frightened by them, he made a scream.
Seeing that Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies falling motionless, the demons then tied 
him with plaited chords of hemp and bark of trees.
Hanuma approved of being forcibly bound and reviled by the enemies, with an assured feeling 
that Ravana was curious as he was, to see him.
That powerful Hanuma, tied with those chords of hemp and bark, was relieved of the missile, 
since the bondage of that missile does not indeed coexist with another bondage.
Conceiving that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, bound with the bark of trees, 
as having been relieved of the missile, the heroic Indrajit, on his part, then became thoughtful as 
follows: "A person tied with other means cannot indeed be bound again by the missile."
"Alas! My great exploit has been rendered futile. The scope of the mystic formula has 
not been considered by the demons. Once the spell has been made ineffective, another missile cannot 
be operative. All of us became jeopardized."
Hanuma, liberated from the missile being dragged away by the demons and afflicted by 
the ties of ropes, could not realize that he was liberated from the missile.
That Hanuma, then being beaten with sticks and fists by the cruel demons, was dragged 
to the vicinity of Ravana.
Then, recognizing that Hanuma, tied with barks of trees and ropes, but liberated by the 
missile, Indrajit slowed that mighty Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys, to Ravana there sitting along 
with a body of his attendants.
The demons showed to Ravana, the king of demons that captured Hanuma, the jewel among 
the foremost of monkeys who looked like an elephant in a rut.
So went round the following conversations from the heroic demons there: "Who is this 
being? Whose savant is he? Where has he come from? What is his pursuit? Who is his alley?"
Thereafter, some demons, highly enraged, said to one another as follows: "Let this monkey 
be killed, even roasted alive and devoured."
After crossing over the path swiftly, the high-souled Hanuma saw there the palace of 
Ravana, decorated with highly precious stones and his elderly attendants sitting at the feet of Ravana.
That Ravana, who was endowed with extraordinary energy, saw Hanuma as the foremost of 
monkeys, being dragged hither and thither by demons of ugly countenance.
Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys also saw Ravana the king of demons, charged with luster 
and strength and blazing like the sun.
That Ravana, rolling his red-hot eyes with rage by seeing that Hanuma and thereafter 
seeing his important ministers who were elder to his by clan and character sitting there, ordered them 
to interrogate Hanuma.
Questioned, as per order, by those ministers as to the purpose of his operation and the 
motive of his act, that Hanuma at the outset informed, "I came from Sugreeva as an envoy."Jambumali, the demon with great tusks, wielding a bow, donning crimson garlands and clothes, 
wearing beautiful chaplet and charming ear-rings, possessing a gigantic body, having round and open 
eyes, the demon causing diseases, unconquerable in battle, a strong demon and the son of Prahasta, commanded 
by Ravana, started stretching with rashness his big bow resembling a rainbow garnished splendorous 
arrows and which brilliance was similar to that of lightening and produced a sound like that of  
thunder.
The tumultuous sound created out of the twanging of that bow soon filled up the quarters, 
intermediate points and the sky.
Seeing him, arriving by a chariot yoked with donkeys, Hanuma who was endowed with 
swiftness was thrilled with joy and made a noise too.
The long-armed Jambumali transfixed sharp arrows into that great monkey, Hanuma who was 
standing on the top of the archy doorway.
He transfixed Hanuma the leader of monkeys in the face with an arrow with a crescent-shaped 
head, on the head with an arrow having an ear-shaped top, and in the arms with ten steel arrows.
That crimson face of Hanuma, hit by an arrow, shone like a full-blown lotus touched by 
a sun's ray in autumn.
The face of Hanuma, which was naturally crimson, and smeared with blood, beamed 
like a large lotus in the sky sprinkled with drops of sandal.
Hanuma, struck by those arrows, was enraged with that demon and then saw by his side, 
a big rock of a very large measure.
Uplifting that rock with strength, the athletic Hanuma hurled it with force. The enraged 
the demon then struck back that rock with ten arrows.
Seeing that work in vain, the powerful Hanuma of terrific prowess, uprooted a very large 
sal tree and whirled it around.
Seeing the mighty Hanuma, whirling around the sal tree, the exceedingly strong Jambumali 
discharged numerous arrows.
He split the sal tree with four arrows and struck the arms of Hanuman with five arrows, 
in the chest with one arrow and the space between the breast with ten arrows.
Hanuma, with his body full of arrows, was highly enraged and took the same iron rod 
as well as clasping it swiftly, whirling it around.
Spinning the iron rod with great speed, Hanuma, richly endowed with strength and highly 
agitated, threw it on the broad chest of Jamubumali.
That Jambumali's head was not there, nor his arms, nor his knees, nor his bow, nor his 
chariot and nor his horses were seen nor his arrows.
Thus struck by Hanuma, the mighty Jambumali, with his limbs and ornaments crushed to 
powder was instantly killed, and fell dead on the ground.
Hearing Jambumali having been killed, as also the mighty Kimkaras, Ravana was angry with 
his red enraged eyes.
Since the mighty son of Prahasta was killed, Ravana rolling his red eyes with rage, 
immediately ordered the sons of ministers possessing high strength and prowess, to go to the battle.Thereafter, an energetic demon named Shardula came and saw the army, commanded by
Sugriva, which was drawn up in a battle array.
That demon, the spy of Ravana the evil natured king of ogres, coolly observed that
army from all sides, speedily returned to Lanka and spoke to their king as follows:
"Boundless and immeasurable like another ocean, this multitude of monkeys and bears
is approaching Lanka.".
"These brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the sons of Dasaratha, the excellent and the
most dignified men endowed with beauty have arrived in the cause of Sita and settled in a camp
after reaching the sea shore" .
"O, monarch! Their army is employed around a radius of ten yojanas (eighty miles)on
all sides. You have to ascertain this truth quickly"
"O, monarch! Your other spies also ought to ascertain the fact quickly. Under such
circumstances, either conciliation or an act of giving away or sowing dissention (in the enemy's
ranks) may be employed."
Hearing Shardula's words Ravana the lord of demons was perturbed and immediately
determined his cause of action. Then he spoke the following words to a demon by name, Shuka the
foremost among those who know their duty.
"Going quickly, speak fearlessly to king Sugriva on my behalf, according to my
command, in an excellent and gentle voice, as follows:"
O, great king! You are indeed born in a noble family, possessor of a great strength
and are a son of Riksharaja. No gain whatsoever or any harm will accrue to you (from this battle)
.O, lord of monkeys! Nevertheless, you are like a brother to me."
"What does it matter to you, if I have embezzled the wife of a wise prince?
(Therefore) return to Kishkindha"
"This Lanka cannot be reached by monkeys in any way. It cannot be acquired even by
celestials and Gandharvas (celestial musicians), why to talk about men and monkeys?"
Then Shuka the demon heralded by Ravana turned himself into the form of a bird and
quickly flew into the sky.
Proceeding in the sky for a distance continuously over the ocean, Shuka then stood
up in the sky itself and spoke these words to Sugriva:
Shuka repeated all the words the wicked Ravana had told him to say to Sugriva. As he
was still speaking, the monkeys bounded into the air to reach him at that moment quickly to tear
off his wings and to smite him by their fists.
The demon thus attacked was forcibly seized by all the monkeys and immediately
brought down to the ground from the sky.
Shuka being harassed by monkeys spoke the following words: "O, Rama! Messengers are
not to be killed. Let your monkeys be restrained properly."
"That messenger, who by abandoning the opinion of his king will speak about his own
opinion though he being a messenger and he who on the other hand speaks that which was not told to
him, that messenger is indeed fit to be killed."
Hearing Shuka's complaining words, Rama spoke to the foremost of monkeys, who were
beating him as aforesaid, saying "Do not kill him"
Perceiving no fear from monkeys, Shuka became light winged, virtually standing in
the sky and spoke again the following words.
"O, Sugriva, rich in courage and possessing great strength and valor! What am I to
tell Ravana, whose nature is to cause world to cry?"
Hearing the aforesaid words, the mightily strong Sugriva the king of monkeys and the
foremost among them, with a merciless mind then spoke to the blame less Shuka, Ravana's spy, as
follows:
"O, Ravana, worthy of killing! You are not my companion. You are not worthy of
sympathy. You are not the person who helped me in any way. I do not like you, as you are Rama's
enemy. Hence, You are worthy to be killed like Vali, along with your associates"
"O, the king of demons! I am killing you along with your sons, relatives and other
kinsfolk. Arriving with a great army, I will reduce the entire Lanka and all of you to ashes."
"O, stupid Ravana! You along with your younger brother will not be left unkilled by
Rama, even if you are protected by all including Indra (the lord of celestials) or even if you have
disappeared (by virtue of conjuring trick) or obtained, the solar orbit or entered the nethermost
subterranean region or even if approached the lotus feet of Shiva (the lord of Kailasa
mountain)"
"I do not see any protector to you as such in the three worlds, nor do I see any
devilish being or a demon or a Gandharva (celestial musician) or an ogre coming forward to protect
you."
"You killed Jatayu, the king of vultures and who was senior to you in old age. Why
the wide-eyed Sita was not taken away in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana? Having made her
captive, you do not recognize her for what she is."
"You are unaware how strong, high soled and irresistible even to celestials, is this
Rama the excellent man of Raghu dynasty, who shall deprive you of your life."
Thereafter, Angada the son of Vali and the foremost of the monkeys spoke as follows:
"O, Sugriva the highly intelligent! He is not an ambassador. He appears to me as a spy."
"All our army has been indeed evaluated by him, standing here. Let him be made
captive. Let him not return to Lanka. This indeed finds favor with me."
Commanded then by the king Sugriva, the monkeys jumped up, seized and bound him, who
without defence, wailed loudly.
Harassed by those monkeys there, Shuka on his part cried loudly towards Rama, the
high soled son of Dasaratha as follows:
"My wings are being pulled out forcibly. My eyes are being pierced. If I die, all
the sins incurred by me between my birth and my death would fall to your share."
Hearing that lamentation of Shuka, Rama did not allow his killing by the monkeys.
Rama ordered monkeys to release him, as he came as an ambassador.Hearing the death of Dhumraksha, Ravana the King of demons was possessed of anger
and began to hiss like a serpent. Polluted by anger, with long and burning sighs, he addressed the
cruel and mighty Vajradamshtra, a demon (as follows)
"O, warrior! Go ahead as the head of the demons and slay Rama the son of Dasaratha,
as also Sugreeva and his monkeys!"
"So it be" answered the leader of the demons who was a conjurer and departed with
many divisions of the army that surrounded him. With the utmost attention, he assembled teams of
elephants, horses mules camels and chariots adorning them with conspicuous flags and banners and he
himself was well-prepared.
Adorned with colourful bracelets and a diadem, Vajradamshtra set out immediately,
wielding a bow and well-covered by an armour.
That army-general circumambulated and ascended his chariot, duly decorated with
flags and shiningly adorned with purpose.
Infantry of every kind issued forth, furnished in their hands with weapons such as
clubs, excellent javelins, smooth pestles, harpoons, bows, lances, spears, swords, discus, maces
and sharp axes.
All those excellent demons in their resplendent and coloured uniforms, full of
strength and mounted on elephants furious with rut, resembled moving mountains.
All those excellent demons in their resplendent and coloured uniforms, full of
strength and mounted on elephants furious with rut, resembled moving mountains.
That whole army of demons paraded, looking as brilliant as the clouds, with
lightning and sound in the rainy season. They emerged from the southern gate where the General
Angada is stationed.
While those demons set forth, inauspicious portents appeared. From a cloudless yet
burning sky, meteors fell. Fearful jackals, emitting their howls, belched forth flames and
fire.
The dreadful beasts then foretold destruction of demons, who while entering the
combat, stumbled miserably.
Ever after seeing these portents Vajradamshtra of exceeding prowess and sharpness,
shored up courage and being fond of battle, set out for the combat.
The monkeys, burning for victory, seeing their enemies advancing, made tremendous
shouts which echoed every quarter.
Thereafter, a tumultuous battle ensured between the monkeys and the demons, who were
cruel, of ferocious form and desirous of each other's destruction.
Some warriors of great energy, coming for war, their necks, and bodies severed, fell
to the surface of the earth, their entire bodies bathed in blood.
Some other warriors, who did not turn back in battle, with arms resembling steel,
approached one another, attacking with various kinds of weapons.
An extremely great and terrible noise, breaking the hearts, was heard there from
trees, rocks and weapons.
A terrific noise of the wheel-rims of chariots and the bow, along with the
tumultuous sounds of couches, kettle-drums and tabours arose there.
Some demons, leaving weapons, performed battle with their arms. The demons were
beaten and their bodies made fragmented by the monkeys of fighting arrogance, with their palms,
feet, fists, trees and knees. Some demons were crushed to powder with rocks.
Tremendously frightening the monkeys in the battle by his arrows, Vajradamshtra
moved himself in the battle-field like Yama the God of Death moving at the time of dissolution of
the worlds, wielding a noose in his hand.
The strong demons skilled in weaponry and wielding various kinds of weapons, killed
the army of monkeys in that battle, with their increased anger.
The courageous Angada the son of Vali, twice possessed of anger, killed all those
demons in the battle, like a world-destroying fire.
The valiant Angada with his raging red eyes lifted a tree and killed all those troop
of demons, like a lion killing small animals. Angada, with his prowess resembling that of Indra the
Lord of celestials, brought about a terrific destroyer of the enemies.
The terribly strong demons, struck by Angada there, had their heads shattered and
fell down like chopped off trees.
The earth then appeared fearful, it being covered with chariots, conspicuous flags,
horses, bodies of monkeys and demons with streams of blood flowing there.
That battle-field, decorated with necklaces, bracelets worn on upper arm, garments
and umbrellas looked like an autumnal night.
By the swiftness of Angada, that great army of demons there trembled then, like a
cloud by the swiftness of wind.Ravana conveyed insignificant words that Seetha who was surrounded by ogresses, wretched, without 
happiness and pity.
"You are with thighs like the trunk of an elephant. Seeing me covering your breasts and belly, 
you desire to obtain the disappearance of self due to fear.
"O wide-eyed one! You are endowed with bodily excellencies, pleasing to all people. I desire you. 
O lovable one! respect me."
"O Seetha! Here there are no humans or ogres with the ability to change form. Let your fear caused 
due to me be removed."
"O one with fear! Obtaining women belonging to others or abducting them by force is a righteous deed 
for ogres by all means. There is no doubt in this."
"O Seetha! It is like this. desire very much may behave in whatever way it likes in my body. But 
I will not touch you without lust."
"O queen of my heart! In this matter, fear is not to be made. O love! Believe in me. Truly become 
with love. Do not become absorbed in sorrow like this."
"Single plait, the bed of ground, mediation,dirty cloth, fasting at an inappropriate time - all these 
are not useful to you."
"O Seetha! After getting me gain wonderful garlands, sandals, Agallochums, a variety of clothes 
and best ornaments, the best drinks, beds and seats, song and dance and musical instrument."
"You are a gem among women. Do not be like this. Make decorations on your limbs. O one with a good 
body! Getting me how will you become unsuited for luxuries?"
"This your youth born beautifully is passing away, whichever youth is quickly passing away will 
not come back again like the flow of water."
"O one with auspicious appearance! The creator of form, that creator of the world, Lord Brahma 
has made you and stopped - I think thus. There is not another who is equal to your appearance."
"O Seetha! Obtaining you endowed with beauty and youth, which man even if he is Lord Brahma himself 
will disregard (leave) you."
"O one with a face like that of the moon! O one with broad hips! Whichever limb I see, my eye is 
getting tied in that that limb."
"O Seetha! Become my wife. Leave this ignorance. In all my many best women brought from here and 
there, become foremost consort. Let there be auspicious to you."
"O timid one! Whatever gems that have been brought by force, all those, my this kingdom and also 
myself belong to you."
"O charmful lady! Conquering the entire earth together with a chain of various cities for your sake, 
I can give it to king Janaka.
"In this world, I do not see another one who is equally matched to me. See my very great power."
"Suras and Asuras defeated with broken flags by me in war many times are powerless to stand in 
an army against me."
"Desire me! Now let your best decoration be made. On your body let ornaments also with great brilliance 
be fit. I will see well your form together with decoration."
"O one with the best face! O timid one! With consideration enjoy luxuries according to your desire 
together with decoration. Drink. Rejoice."
"You donate land and wealth according to your wish. With confidence behave freely in my matter. 
Fearlessly order also."
" By my grace with your sporting, tour relatives will also sport. O auspicious one! You see my 
wealth and my fame."
"O beautiful one! What can you do with Rama clad in tatters, with lost hope of victory, with gone 
fortune? Roaming in forests, observing austerities, and also sleeping on the floor, I doubt if Rama is alive or not."
"O Seetha, Rama indeed does not get an opportunity even to see you like moonlight covered by dark 
clouds with cranes at the front."
"Like Keerthi got by Hiranyakasipu from Indra's hand, Rama is not suited to get you from my hands."
"O one with a beautiful smile! O one with beautiful teeth! O one with beautiful eyes! O charmful 
one! O timid one! You are stealing my heart like a serpent stolen by Garuda.
"You are Wearing a silk cloth in a bad condition. You are emaciated. Even though you have not decorated, 
seeing you I am not getting happiness in my wives."
"O Seetha! Whoever women living in gynaeceum endowed with all virtues, have sovereignty on all 
of them."
"O one with black hair! Those women and apsaras who are the best among the three worlds will 
serve you like the goddess of wealth."
"O one with beautiful hips! O one with beautiful eyebrows! Enjoy according to your comfort whatever 
gems and wealth belonging to Kubera, all those three worlds, and me."
"O Seetha! Rama is not equal to me by austerity, not equal by might; not equal by strength, not 
equal by wealth, by brilliance, and by fame."
"O playful one! I will give hordes of wealth and land. You drink. Roam freely and play. Enjoy luxuries. 
Sport according to comfort in me. Your relatives may sport together in you."
"O timid one! With body decorated with gold colored, pure garlands, roam with me in forests born 
at sea shore filled with groups of flowered trees and with humble bees."
When Seetha spoke thus Ravana is embittered, and knitting his eyebrows he indeed spoke these rudish 
words to Seetha. 
"I am known as Ravana, oh, lady with superb complexion, let safety betide you, the highly valorous and 
ten-headed stepbrother of Kubera. 
"I am that Ravana at whose sight all the gods together with gandharva-s, evil-spirits, birds and snakes 
will always be frightened and fleeing, as with the people frightened and fleeing from death. 
"I am that Ravana who when infuriated for some other reason took up a duel with Kubera, his brother 
from stepparent, wherein that Kubera is set up against and completely trounced in a combat. 
"I am that Ravana by whom Kubera, the god for Wealth-Management whose vehicular transport is handled 
by humans, is tormented fearfully and made to completely abandon his wealthiest place which is presided 
over by him till then, and I am the one who made that Kubera to flee to the excellent Mt. Kailash where 
he is somehow living, because I will not cause any harm on Mt. Kailash as I hold it sacred. 
"I am that Ravana, oh, auspicious lady, who just by his valour acquired Kubera's auspicious aircraft 
known as Pushpaka, whose pilotage is just by the wish of its aviator, with which I will be travelling 
in skies. 
"Just by seeing rancour-shot face of mine, oh, Maithili, all the gods will quickly shoot off, even if 
Indra is leading them, then where is the question of their confronting me. 
"Where I will be staying there the Air-god wafts doubtfully, lest his gusts and blasts may hurt me, 
and the Sun also effectuates his singeing sunbeams as cooling moonbeams, lest I may abduct his wife 
Prabha, the Sunshine. 
"At places where I will be staying or freely moving there the leaves of trees will be less of rustle, 
lest I may wilt them up, and there the gush of water of rivers too will quieten, lest I may dry them 
up. 
"My magnificent city known as Lanka is there on the other shore of the ocean, plethoric with all kinds 
of amenities, as well as with ghastly demons, which city will be on par with Indra's Amaravati, but 
for meekly gods and meaningless souls. 
"That gorgeous city is completely walled in with compound walls that are adorned with whitish silver, 
and its palace-chambers are golden, and its archways are fully jewelled with lapis jewels. 
"It is encumbered with elephants, horses and chariots, well sounded by the sounds of trumpets, and with 
trees which yield fruits that fulfil all the savours, and it is bedecked with chirrupy pleasure-gardens. 

"Oh, princess, oh, self-respectful lady, if you reside there together with me, hè, Seetha, then you 
will not think of yourself as one from among human females. 
"Revelling in humanly luxuries, over and beyond in heavenly luxuries also, you will not recollect humanly 
Rama, whose longevity is lessened. 
"Though Rama is the eldest son, king Dasharatha established his dear son Bharata as king, and because 
Rama is spineless he is put to flight to forests, and now, what is he and what am I, in matter of sovereignty. 

"Rama is subverted from kingdom, thus dwindled is valour, thus winded down is his anima, thus he has 
become a pitiable one, thus he became an ascetic as nothing else is there for him to undertake, oh, 
broad-eyed lady, what do you aspire to do with such a Rama? 
"I, the king of all the demons, am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you in love, and instead 
of beseeching me to love you, your rejection and speaking this way, is unapt of you.
"Although I am the king of all the demons, on seeing you I am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came 
to you, thus you love me... but rejecting me this way is unapt of you, as you alone will be loosing 
heavenly comforts, if you reject me. 
"Oh, modest lady, on refusing me you surely become remorseful like Uurvashi who once kicked Puruurava 
with her feet. 
"He that Rama is merely a human, and in war he equals me not by my finger, oh, richly colourful lady, 
and I chanced here merely by your serendipity, thus you honour me and my desire to possess you..." Thus 
Ravana spoke to Seetha. 
Vaidehi who is spoken thus is infuriated on her part and with her eyes bloodshot spoke these bitter 
words to the king of demons in that lonely lace. 
"How you wish to commit sins although saying that Kubera, a god reverenced by all of the gods, is your 
brother? 
"All the demons will perforce get completely destroyed, oh, Ravana, for whom you the cruel and culpable 
one with uncontrolled senses is the king, and you will be blameworthy for the elimination of righteous 
demons like Vibheeshana, et al. 
"It may be possible to live after abducting Shaci Devi, the wife of Indra, somehow and anyhow there 
will be no liveability after abducting me, the wife of Rama. 
"Oh, demon, un-mirrored is the prettiness of prettyish Shaci Devi, and one may live long on forcibly 
snatching her away from the hands of the wielder of Thunderbolt, Indra, but to him who intimidates or 
abuses me or women like me, there will be nomoksha, release from the cycle of rebirth, 
even if he has consumedamR^itaambrosia." Thus Seetha spoke to Ravana. Tormented by Rama in fury, that Ravana then for his part, who was boasting of his
fight, flew into a great rage.
Raising his bow, his eyes blazing with anger, extremely enraged as he was with Rama
in that great battle, the valiant Ravana of prowess continued to oppress, by covering Rama with
thousands of streams of arrows, as a rainy cloud would fill a pond with thousands of arrow-like
torrents from the sky.
Covered by a multitude of arrows discharged from Ravana's bow in battle, Rama did
not wince, like a large mountain which was unshakable.
The valiant Rama stood interrupting the torrents of arrows with his own arrows in
the battle-field and endured them as rays of the sun.
Then, the enraged Ravana of brisk hand, struck thousands of arrows into the breast
of the great-souled Rama.
Rama, bathed in blood in the battle-field, appeared like a very big Kimshuka tree
with bloom in a forest.
Enraged at the impact of the arrows, that Rama of very great splendour , took hold
of arrows which shone like the sun at the time of dissolution of the world.
Both Rama and Ravana who were see each other at that time in the battle-field, which
was shrouded in darkness by the arrows.
Bursting into laughter, though filled with anger, the valiant Rama, the son of
Dasaratha spoke the following harsh words to Ravana.
"O the worst of demons! Since you took away my helpless wife without my notice from
Janasthana, hence you are not a person of prowess."
"Having taken away by force the miserable Seetha while she was staying in the forest
away from me, you think:  I am a champion'."
"Having done an act of cowardly persons of laying your hands on another's wife,
posing as a hero in relation to women without a protector, you think: "I am a champion'."
"O shameless person, who have broken the bounds of morality and are unstable of
customs, having laid hold through vanity of death (in the form of Seetha) you think  I am a
champion'."
"Indeed a praiseworthy, great and glorious act has been performed by you, a valiant
brother of Kubera, the god of wealth, rich in strength!"
"Reap now and today the stupendous fruit of that noxious and contemptible act,
perpetrated through sheer vanity."
"O evil-minded one! You think:  I am a champion' yourself! Shame did not stand in
your way at all, for having taken away Seetha like a thief."
"If Seetha were laid hands upon by you in my presence, you would have surely seen
your brother Khara at that very moment when killed with my arrows."
"Thank heaven, O stupid fellow, you have come within the range of my sight. I will
dispatch you to the world of Death, by my sharp arrows, today."
"Let your head, having blazing ear-rings lying on the dust-laden battle-field, be
carried away by beasts of prey, after being chopped off by my arrows today."
"O Ravana! Let vultures fly down on your wounded breast when you have been thrown
down on the ground and oozing out from the orifices caused by the impact of my pointed
arrow-tips."
"Let birds (such as crows and vultures) tear out your bowels, as eagles would drag
serpents when you fall down dead when pierced by my arrows today."
Thus speaking, the valiant Rama, the annihilator of enemies, poured out streams of
arrows on Ravana, who was in the vicinity.
The prowess, the strength, the enthusiasm and the stamina of arms of Rama became
two-fold, when he longed for the death of his enemy in battle.
All kinds of mystic missiles came to light in the mind of Rama the learned self and
in his excessive enthusiasm, Rama of extra-ordinary energy became all the more swift-handed.
Recognizing those good omens, Rama, the destroyer of demons, tormented Ravana even
more vehemently.
While being struck by volleys of stones hurled by the monkeys and the showers of
arrows coming from Rama, Ravana felt bewildered at heart.
Ravana could no longer take up weapons, nor stretch his bow, nor reacted to Rama's
prowess - on account of his mind being confused.
As the time of his death approached, the arrows swiftly hurled and the various kinds
of missiles employed by Ravana did not turn to be of any use in battle.
Seeing Ravana reduced to such a plight, the charioteer driving the chariot, for his
part, without getting excited, calmly and slowly carried off his chariot away from the
battle-front.
On seeing Ravana, the king sunk down; hopelessly bereft of energy, the charioteer
diverting in haste the chariot of Ravana, which was rumbling like a cloud, thereupon sneaked away
from the battle-field in dismay.Hearing Atikaya having been killed in the hands of the great-souled Lakshmana,
Ravana was worried and spoke as follows:
"Dhumraksha, who was greatly impatient Akampana who was excellent among all wielders
of weapons, Prahasta and Kumbhakarna were killed by Rama, who was unwearied in battle. The mighty
and valiant demons longing for battle, who conquer the adversaries, who was never defeated in
battle by the enemies they along with their enemies were killed. Many other mighty warriors.
"That day, Indrajit, my son, whose strength and prowess are renowned, bound both
Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers with terrific arrows, on which boons had been conferred."
"That terrific bind of arrow cannot be released by any celestial or a mighty demon
or by Yakshas the supernatural beings or Gandharvas the celestial musicians or Pannagas the
serpent-demons. Rama and Lakshmana, the two brothers were released from that tie of arrows either
by their power or by their sorcery or by their marvel I do not know that."
"All of those valiant demon-warriors set out for battle, at my command, were killed
by those exceptionally mighty monkeys."
"I do not find any demon, who can destroy the valiant Rama along with Lakshmana,
Sugreeva and Vibhishana accompanied by their army in battle now."
"By Rama's valour, the demons were destroyed. Alas! How great is Rama's strength!
How great is the power of his arrow!"
"Some regiments of the army have to protect this City and even Ashoka garden where
Seetha is being guarded, vigilantly on all sides."
"We should know the locations of army-regiments and also the places where persons
are exiting and entering at all times, again and again.
"O demons! Stay on all sides with your respective armies. The various positioning of
those monkeys are to be watched."
"Indifference should not be shown to monkeys in any way at any time, either at
evening or at midnight or at dawn. You have watch whether the army of adversaries is fervently
active or advancing or staying where it was."
Hearing those words of Ravana, all the mighty demons then precisely carried it out
forthwith in its totality.
Having thus instructed all of them, Ravana the king of demons, suffering from
prickly sorrow and depression, penetrated deeply into his palace.
Blazed as he was with a fire of anger, Ravana the mighty lord of demons, then
remained broading about the loss of his son (Atikaya) and also sighing again and again.Seeing that the great-souled Rama killed Kumbhakarna, the demons reported the matter
to Ravana, the king of demons (as follows):
"O king! That Kumbhakarna, looking like Yama the god of death, driving away the army
of monkeys and devouring some monkeys, met with death, the time's act."
"Showing his prowess for a moment, Kumbhakarna your brother, was extinguished by the
fiery energy of Rama. Injured by Rama's arrows, Kumbhakarna who was looking like a mountain became
an ugly mass, with his body discharging blood, as his nose and ears were cut off, resembling a tree
scorched by a forest-fire, with his trunk half-submerged in a terribly looking sea and obstructing
the main gate of Lanka."
Hearing that the mighty Kumbhakarna was killed in battle, Ravana was tormented with
grief and fell down, fainted.
Hearing that his paternal uncle was killed; Devantaka, Narantaka, Trishira and
Atikaya were afflicted with sorrow and wept.
Hearing that Kumbhakarna, their brother was killed by Rama, who was unwary in his
actions, Mahodara and Mahaparshva (step-brothers of Kumbhakarna) were overcome with grief.
Then, recovering his consciousness with difficulty, distressed as he was for the
killing of Kumbhakarna and perplexed in mind, Ravana the foremost of demons, lamented (as
follows):
"Alas! O hero, destroying the pride of enemies! O mighty Kumbhakarna! Leaving me
behind, you have gone by divine will to the abode of Yama the lord of death."
"O mighty Kumbhakarna! Where are you going alone, leaving me behind, after having
tormented the army of enemies and without taking away the thorn of grief from relatives and
me."
"Indeed I shall no longer live now, that this right hand of mine, taking refuge on
when I had no fear of celestials and ogres, has fallen down."
"How such a hero, who destroyed the pride of celestials and demons, as also who was
an image of fire that was to destroy the world, was killed by Rama today in battle?"
"Having been afflicted by Rama's arrows, how are you, whom not even a clash of a
thunder-bolt ever caused any fall, falling now insensibly on the earth's surface?"
"Seeing you killed in battle, these troops of celestials and sages, standing in the
sky, are shouting with rejoice."
"It is doubly sure that the monkeys, having achieved their purpose, will be rejoiced
and now itself will ascend the inaccessible door-ways of Lanka here from all sides."
"I have nothing to do with a kingdom and what shall I do with Seetha? I have no
intention to live, bereft of Kumbhakarna."
"If I cannot kill Rama, who killed my brother, in battle, I would indeed prefer
death, but in no case this useless life which has no meaning."
"Now itself, I will go to that place, where my younger brother is there. I do not
wish to live even for a moment, after abandoning my brothers."
"Seeing me, who did harm to them in the past, the celestials will indeed mock me. O
Kumbhakarna! Now that you are dead, how can I conquer Indra the lord of celestials?"
"Those words of that great-souled Vibhishana, which I did not accept due to
ignorance, have come true."
"Ever since this cruel end of Kumbhakarna and Prahasta has happened, I am feeling
shameful."
"Since that venerable Vibhishana, my pious brother was banished by me, this bitter
fruit of that painful deed has come to me."
Having thus lamented very much piteously in various ways on coming to know that
Kumbhakarna, his younger brother and the enemy of Indra having been killed, Ravana the ten-headed
demon, whose inner feelings were agitated, even sank down, extremely disturbed.Thereafter that intellectual Hanuma saw the moon in the sky shining with rays,
obtaining the middle portion of the sky. Spreading a great quantity of moon shine, the moon looked like a
bull in heat among cows.
After that Hanuma saw the moon coming up destroying the sins of the world, causing
the great ocean to grow and cause all living beings to shine.
Whatever splendour shines over Mount Mandara on earth, on the ocean during
evenings, over the lotuses in the waters, the same splendour shines on the beautiful moon.
Like a swan in a silver cage, like a lion in the cave of Mount Mandara, like a
warrior on a proud elephant, in the same way the moon shone in the sky.
The full moon with its horn-like spot shone like a sharp-horned standing ox with a
high hump, like a great white mountain with tall summits, like an elephant with golden tusks.
The Divine moon who lost the stain of cold water and frost, with lost stain due to
eclipse by the great planet sun, one who has a calm spot which is an abode of brilliant splendour,
with a symbol of a hare, shone brilliantly.
In whatever way a lion obtaining a level surfaced rock (shines), in whatever way
best elephant obtaining a great battle(shines), in whatever way a king obtaining kingdom(shines),
in the same way, the clear moon shone.
The Divine evening with lost stain due to the rise of the shining moon, with the stain due
to meal of flesh-eating rakshasas, and in which the bitterness of mind of young women and their
lovers are wiped away, became with a heavenly glow.
Musical notes from stringed instruments which were comforting to ears started. Women
with good character was sleeping with husbands and also rakshasas with an extremely strange character
started to roam.
That Hanuma the courageous one, the intellectual one, saw houses with people in
heat, houses filled with people, full chariots, horses, elephants and the best furniture and also full
of wealth.
Hanuma saw rakshasas railing a lot at one another moving their heavy shoulders,
throwing wild and incoherent words a lot, insulting one another being intoxicated.
(Hanuma saw) rakshasas who smote breasts, those who threw limbs on women, those who
were spreading their strange forms sporting their strong bows.
Hanuma saw some women applying sandal paste on their bodies and also some other
women sleeping there, in the same way, some women with good appearance were smiling, and some other
women were sighing in anger.
Hanuma saw (the city of Lanka that) shone with great elephants making sound and also
with gentlemen well respected, shone with warriors in a wrestling bout, with long sighs, like
serpents in a lake hissing.
Hanuma saw Yatudhanaas who were intellectuals, who were good talkers, who had good
devotion, important people to the world, who had various ways, and people who had beautiful names
in that city.
Hanuma saw people with good appearance, who had various good virtues, those
who were according to their character, and those who were radiant, all those - became happy. Then that
Hanuma saw those who had horrific appearances, those who were according to their appearance - some
of those too.
Hanuma saw thereafter there, their women - those who were eligible for distinction,
those who were of great skill with an interested heart in lovers and drinks and those who were
like stars with good effect.
Hanuma saw some women who were brilliant with radiance, adorned a lot with
bashfulness, those who were hugged by lovers in the middle of the night, those who were hugged with
great pleasure, those who were hugged by flowers like birds.
The intellectual Hanuma saw some other women there comfortably sitting on the laps
of their lovers, at the top of their buildings, dear to their husbands and (some other women)
interested in virtuous deeds, and some possessed by the lord of love.
Hanuma saw women with golden complexion lacking clothes, women with a complexion of
refined gold suitable for mating and some other women also with the colour of the moon and some other
women with beautiful bodies lacking a lover.
Thereafter that Vanara warrior saw those with great happiness, those who obtained
lovers who entertained, those who attracted like flowers, those with great beauty and women in
their houses filled with happiness.
Hanuma saw rows of faces shining like the moon, beautiful rows of eyes with curved
eyebrows and rows of ornaments like beautiful rows of lighting.
Hanuma did not see Seetha, one with great beauty born into a royal family following a
virtuous path, well brought up, like a creeper in full blossom, one who was thin, and one who was
born from the mind (of the creator).
Hanuma did not see that Seetha who stood in the path of ancient righteousness with
Her sight on Sri Rama, who was possessed by the love for Sri Rama, who entered the glorious mind of
husband and always the best among women who were the best.
Hanuma did not see Seetha, tortured by separation from Sri Rama, with unabounding
tears in her throat, in earlier times who had invaluable and best jewellery on her neck, born with
beautiful eyebrows, with a sweet voice, like a she-hen who did not dance in a forest because of
Her current sorrow.
Hanuma did not see Seetha who was like a crescent with a blurred outline, like a
streek of gold coated by dust, like an arrow in an injury, like a series of clouds scattered by
wind.
Hanuma became a numb-minded one for some time, stricken with grief not seeing for a
moment Seetha, wife of Sri Rama the best among those who talk, and the lord of all humans.
Thus, this is the th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.On seeing the fourteen thousands demons of heinous crimes, and even on seeing Trishira, Duushana, and 
even Khara, who are all exterminated by lone Rama, then Shuurpanakha emitted a thunderous blare like 
a thundercloud. 
Highly agitated to witness the deed done by Rama, which deed is highly impossible for others, she hurried 
Lanka ruled by Ravana. 
She saw Ravana who is fulgent with his own radiance, seated with ministers at his nearby in the midst 
of the divine aircraft Pushpaka, as with Indra who will be sitting amidst wind-gods. 
Seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Altar of 
Fire, and he himself resembling the blazing Ritual-fire spurting out of it when that Golden-Fire-Altar 
is drenched with plentiful ghee, she saw such a Ravana. 
An invincible one either for gods or gandharva-s, or to sages with exalted souls, or even to any other 
entity worth its name, whose appearance itself is catastrophic, and who is sitting identical to the 
Terminator, as though that Terminator himself is sitting with a wide gaped mouth, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha 
saw. 
One who is severally bruised in several combats of gods and demons with the thunderbolts from the Vajra 
weapon of Indra, and one who is severally blotched on his chest when the prongs of the tusks of Airavata, 
the lordly elephant of Indra, gored his chest, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. 
One who has twenty arms, ten faces and a broad chest, and a possessor of all regalia of Indra like white 
parasol, white fanning instruments, colours and the like insigne, and at that brave one who is attributed 
with all of the kingly attributes, Shuurpanakha saw. 
Blent with the gleam of Lapis gems studded in his ornaments his glisten is alike that gem, while 
his ear-knobs are made out of refined gold, and his arms strongish, teeth whitish, mouth widish and 
he is mountainous, and Shuurpanakha saw such a Ravana. 
His body bears hundreds of welts caused when assaulted with Vishnu-disc for hundreds of times in wars 
with gods, and when assaulted for hundreds of times with the other assaults-missiles in other gruesome 
wars as well, and Shuurpanakha saw at such a Ravana. 
Likewise, whose limbs are thrashed with thrashing missilery of all gods, whereby his body and soul have 
become harsh, thus he can perpetrate anything swiftly at his will, and he who can capably roil an un-perturbable 
ocean at his wish, at such Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. 
At him who is a volleyer of mountain peaks, a represser of gods, an extirpator of ethical values, and 
a molester of others wives, Shuurpanakha saw. 
He who is a marksman of every divine missile, and an ever interdictor of Vedic-rituals, and who on going 
to the city named Bhogavati, the capital of Naga-s, and on defeating Vaasuki, the King of Serpents, 
has abducted the dear wife of Taksha on molesting her, and Shuurpanakha saw such a molester of others 
wives. 
On going to Mt. Kailash he who has defeated the god who uses humans as his vehicle, namely Kubera, and 
snatched away his aircraft, namely Pushpaka, which aircraft transits at the wish of its steersman, and 
Shuurpanakha saw such a grabber of others possessions. 
He who enviously devastated the divine gardens of Kubera, called Caitraratha, along with a divine Lake 
of Lotuses pertaining to the same Kubera, called Pushkarini, and the gardens of Indra, called Nandana, 
along with other paradisiacal gardens of gods, Shuurpanakha saw such an envious demon. 
Shuurpanakha saw him who is similar to the pinnacle of a mountain, and who with his two hands 
forestalls the highly propitious ones that are the stiflers of their enemies, namely the Sun and Moon, when they tend to 
rise. 
That courageous one who in early times has practised ascesis for ten thousand years in a great-forest, 
and who on accomplishing it has dedicated ten of his heads to the Self-Created Brahma, she saw such 
a Ravana with such ten heads. 
Whereby, to whom there is an indemnity against death in war at the hand of gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
devils, birds, or reptiles, excepting humans, and Shuurpanakha saw such an unimperilled Ravana. 
He who is an extreme-ultraist that expropriates the Soma-juice-oblation form the vessels of oblation 
in Vedic-rituals, which Soma juice-oblation is blest with Vedic-hymns and kept separately by Vedic Brahmans, 
since it is intended and shall belong to Indra and other divinities, and she saw such a plunderer. 
He who is such an embezzler of the Vedic-rituals at the time of their culmination, a malicious one, 
and one with cruel acts, a hinderer of Vedic-rituals, or, the slayer of those Brahmans that conduct 
Vedic-rituals contrary to his wishes, and one who is heartless and a rampant demon, who is a delighter 
in the iniquity to the people, at him Shuurpanakha saw. 
She that demoness Shuurpanakha saw her brother who makes all beings to wail, an alarming one to all 
the worlds, an atrocious one and highly formidable Ravana. 
And at him who is conspicuously sitting on a throne, attired and bejewelled in excellent apparels and 
jewels, shining forth with marvellous garlands, and who is like the Ultimate-Time on the rise destined 
for the Eventual-Time. 
Demoness Shuurpanakha nearing Ravana, who is the highly fortunate king of demons, an enemy-destroyer 
and a felicity of the dynasty of Sage Pulasta, and who is now surrounded by his ministers, she spoke 
this sentence. 
She who is disfigured by the high souled Lakshmana, and who is still perplexed with the fear of Lakshmana 
and her own craving for Rama as well, on displaying her misfortune to everybody that fearless rover 
Shuurpanakha spoke this very caustic sentence to Ravana, whose eyes are broad and burning. Rama then travelled along with Lakshmana towards northeast direction keeping Vishvamitra afore and neared 
the hall of Vedic ritual of Janaka in Mithila kingdom. 
Rama who is with Lakshmana spoke to the tigerly saint Vishvamitra, " the Vedic-ritual of noble-souled 
Janaka is excellent, indeed with bountifully garnered paraphernalia of the ritual. 
"Oh, highly fortunate sage, this place abounds with many thousands of Brahmans who are experts in Vedic 
practises and who seem to be the dwellers of numerous provinces, and also discernable are the cottages 
of sages rife with hundreds of carts full with their ceremonial chattels, as such oh, Brahman, a campsite 
may be decided for us too, as I discern every inch is inhabited." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. 
On hearing the words of Rama that great-saint Vishvamitra arranged a camp at an unfrequented place that 
has refreshing water. 
On hearing that Vishvamitra has arrived in Mithila, then the best king Janaka instantly forged ahead 
towards Vishvamitra, keeping his unreprovable priest Shataananda afore of the team, in deference to 
Vishvamitra. 
Even the Ritvik-s, the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, of the great souled king Janaka arrived 
with post-haste taking holy waters, and they have ritualistically offered that sanctified water to Vishvamitra. 

On receiving that veneration from the great souled Janaka, Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of 
the king Janaka, as well about the unhindered proceedings of that Vedic-ritual. 
Then Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of saints, mentors, clerics, as befitting to their order, 
and joined the company of all of the sages as a happy-souled sage. 
The king Janaka adjoining his palms then spoke to that eminent-sage Vishvamitra, "oh, reverend sage, 
please be seated on this high seat, along with these eminent saints in their respective seats." Thus 
Janaka spoke to Vishvamitra 
On hearing the words of Janaka that great-sage Vishvamitra took his seat, and king Janaka also took 
seat along with his royal priest Shataananda, and the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, namely Ritvik-s, 
and along with his ministers. 
On beholding all of them seated all about in their respective seats as demanded by procedure king Janaka 
then spoke to Vishvamitra. 
Today my Vedic ritual is enriched with your advent, whereby I deem that gods have fructified the ritual. 
Let the ritual be like that. I deem that I have obtained the fruit of the ritual just on seeing godlike 
you here today. 
Oh, Brahman, at which Vedic-ritual hall you have arrived along with so many sages that happens to be 
mine, whereby, oh, eminent saint, I feel that I am honoured and hallowed. 
"Oh, Brahma-sage, the scholarly Ritvik-s conducting my Vedic-ritual are saying that only twelve more 
days are remaining to complete the observation of ritual-pledge, and then oh, Kaushika, it will be apt 
of you to see the gods who arrive at the conclusion of this Vedic-ritual expecting their due in the 
ritual." So said king Janaka to Vishvamitra. 
On speaking to that tigerly sage Vishvamitra in this way, the king again asked the sage pointedly and 
inquisitively with adjoined palms and with a gladdened face. 
These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and arrogant 
lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, 
and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals 
and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals have chanced 
on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have come here, and whose scions are 
they? 
Oh, great-saint, whose sons are these two valiant youngsters who are brandishing best weapons? They 
are embellishing this province as the Sun and Moon doeth the sky. Each to each they are clonal by postural-language, 
by facial-language and by body language. They appear valorous but boyish in their appearance, as their 
curls are still jet-black like crow-wings. Thus, whether they are immature by age though mature by their 
valour or so, I wish to listen about them in actuality. 
On hearing the words of great-souled Janaka, Vishvamitra whose anima is immeasurable, has announced 
that those two as the sons of king Dasharatha. 
The highly resplendent great-saint Vishvamitra has informed the high souled Janaka about the coming 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, their stopping over there and elimination 
of demons at that place, their indefatigable travel along with him, beholding City of Vishaala, seeing 
Ahalya, her reuniting with Sage Gautama, likewise their coming hitherward to gain a grasp of great bow 
of Shiva. On informing all these incidents to Janaka as well as to Shataananda, who incidentally is 
the son of Ahalya, sage Vishvamitra paused. The emasculated Indra then with panicked eyes spoke to gods, siddha-s, gandharva-s, 
and carana-s, keeping Fire-god as their helms-god. 
I have Indeed incited fury in that noble-souled Sage Gautama by effectuating 
hindrance in his asceticism, but I have accomplished a task of gods. 
By Gautama's anger I am rendered testicle-less and his wife Ahalya is also rejected 
by the sage, and thus by his releasing a severe curse his propriety for ascesis 
is dwindled, therefore his ascesis is pre-empted by me. 
'Therefore, oh, all gods with the assemblages of sages and caarana-s, it will 
be apt of you to make me virile again, as I have acted for the benefit of gods.' 
Thus Indra spoke to all gods. 
On hearing the words of the officiator for Hundred-Vedic-rituals, namely Indra, 
all of the gods and other assemblages of celestials, together with the groups of 
Marut-gods came to the godly manes keeping the Fire-god in van, and appealed. 
'This ram is with testicles and Indra is indeed rendered testicle-less. Taking 
the testicles of this ram they may be given to Indra quickly.' Thus Fire-god started 
his appeal to manes. 
'This ram that is being offered to you shall now be gelded to give its testes 
to Indra, and though this ram is deprived of its organ it will be complete and it 
endows complete satisfaction to you. To those humans who hereafter offer testes-less 
rams in sacrifices for the purpose of your gratification, you shall truly offer 
them plentiful and unmitigated benefits.' Thus Agni, the Fire-god spoke to manes. 

On hearing the words of Agni, the Fire-god, the manes-gods who gathered to collect 
their share of offering have extricated that ram's testes, which is not yet sacrificed 
but tethered to a sacrificial post, and offered them to the Thousand-eyed Indra. 

Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, from then onwards the manes-gods who come to collect their 
share are enjoying even the goats, even if they do not have testes, to endow benefits 
thereof to those that offer those goats, and to join the testes of goats to Indra. 

Oh, Raghava, owing to the efficacy of the great-souled Gautama and his ascesis, 
from then onwards Indra has became one with the testes of a goat. 
"Therefore, oh, great-resplendent Rama, enter the hermitage of Gautama whose deeds 
are pietistic, and atone Ahalya who is highly fortunate and who is in the compose 
of a divinity." Thus Vishvamitra spoke to Rama. 
On hearing Vishvamitra's words Rama entered the hermitage along with Lakshmana and 
keeping Vishvamitra afore. 
She whose splendour is brightened by her ascesis, at whom it is impossible to raise 
an eye for a stare either for gods, or for demons, or for the worldly beings on 
coming close to her, whom the Creator has contrived with careful contemplation as 
an angelic and a completely phantasmal entity, who is like the befogged and beclouded 
moonshine of a full moon as she is hitherto enshrouded by the dried up leaves and 
dust, who is like an unwatchable sunshine mirrored in and glowing from the midst 
of water, for she is hitherto in the midst of denounce, and whose limbs are like 
the tongues of a flaring fire around which fumes are cloaking, as she is hitherto 
practising an utmost ascesis subsisting on air alone, which ascesis alone made her 
like a flaring Ritual Fir, and Rama has seen such a highly glorious Ahalya. 
Ahalya is indeed indiscernible to all the three worlds by the very word of Gautama 
until the manifestation of Rama. 
On reaching the end of curse she came into the view of Raghava-s, and they too gladly 
touched her feet in reverence. 
Reminiscing Gautama's words Ahalya received those two, and self-consciously offered 
water for feet and hand washing, and like that she also offered guestship customarily 
and dutifully, and Rama of Kakutstha on his part acquiesced her hospitality. 
There chanced an abundant floral fall form firmament to the drumbeats of god's drums, 
and the celestials like gandharva-s, apsara-s revelled in a splendid festivity that 
is superb. 
Gods have collectively reverenced her, whose limbs are depurated by the asset of 
her ascesis which is performed as a devotee of Gautama remaining in his directives, 
saying 'Gracious! Goodness!' 
Even that great-resplendent Gautama is heartened when he reunited with Ahalya after 
a long, long a time, and that sage customarily reverenced Rama for actualising his 
solemn utterance, and that great-ascetic Gautama continued his ascesis together 
with Ahalya. 
Even Rama on receiving a conventionally high veneration in the manifestness of that 
great-saint Gautama himself, then moved ahead to Mithila. King Dasharatha commences theputrakaameSTiritual aiming to beget progeny, under 
the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings gather to receive the oblations offered 
in the Horse Ritual conducted by King Dasharatha. They are perturbed at the atrocities of 
Ravana, and request Brahma to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu arrives there and 
pacifies Brahma and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate as human to 
eliminate Ravana.
That intellectual sage and one proficient in Veda-s Rishyasringa contemplated for a while, 
and gaining indications as to which ritual is to be performed, then said the king. 
"I will procedurally conduct the ritual contained in the preamble ofatharva-vedawith procedural hymns, called <<em>>putra kaameSTi i.e., the ritual that bestows sons, for 
your benefit." 
Then that resplendent Sage Rishyasringa commenced thatputrakaameSTiritual, offering 
oblations into sacred fire with ritual acts meticulously contained in hymns. 
Then the deities along with celestial beings, siddha-s, i.e., the souls that obtained salvation, 
and also other esteemed sages who by now are the residents of Heavens have duteously assembled 
in the firmament to receive their part of the oblations. 
Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, 
the creator of worlds. 
"Oh! God, the demon named Ravana is torturing all of us with his intrepidity, as you have 
blessed him, and we are unable to control him. 
"You have given boon to him appreciating his ascesis and oh, god, with high regard to that 
boon of yours we are tolerating all the cruel acts of Ravana from then onwards 
"That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities 
of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of 
universe. 
"That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly 
torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even 
the Brahmans. 
"The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on 
seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namely the ocean will not pulsate either. 

"Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence 
oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination. 
When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said "Aha! The 
idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned. 
"Ravana said while seeking boon that, 'I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or 
by gods, or by other demons...' and I also said 'so be it..." 
"That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his 
death does not occur otherwise." So said Brahma to gods. 
On hearing Brahma explaining himself, then all those gods and great sages became adequately 
happy. 
In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted 
on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, 
clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and 
his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous 
gift called the rain. 
Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down 
and offering prayers addressed Vishnu. 
"Oh! Vishnu, desiring prosperity in all the worlds we nominate you to become the son of the 
ruler and lord of Ayodhya, namely Dasharatha, who is a virtuous one, renowned one and one 
whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king 
Dasharatha, who are in similitude with thehrii, the virtue,shrii, the 
affluence, andkiirti, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth 
as their son. 
"Oh! Vishnu, on your taking birth as human through the wives of Dasharatha you eliminate Ravana 
in war, who has become exacerbating and thorny to all worlds, and who is otherwise not eliminable 
for gods. 
"He that preposterous demon Ravana with his invigorated doggedness is torturing gods along 
with eminent saints, gandharva-s, and siddha-s. 
"He that furious one with his insolence is knocking down sages from their celestial abodes, 
and like that he is knocking down the gandharva-s and apsara celestials too from the heavenly 
gardens Nandana, where they will be taking delight. 
"We the celestial beings like siddha-s, gandharva-s, yaksha-s along with sages have actually 
come for his elimination, and thereby we seek shelter in you. 
"Oh, enemy tormentor, oh, Vishnu, you are the ultimate recourse for all us in eliminating 
enemies of divinity, hence you make up your mind to take birth in human world." The gods appealed 
to Vishnu that way. 
When the god of gods Vishnu, the supreme one among deities, one who is revered by all worlds 
is eulogised this way, then he spoke to all of those celestials that abide in the righteousness 
and that are in the assemblage, keeping the Forefather Brahma at their helm. 
"Get rid off the fear, let safety be upon you, on eliminating that cruel and evil-minded Ravana 
who became dreadful to deities and sages, along with his sons, grandsons, friends, cousins 
and relatives, ministers and forces too in war for your welfare, I will then reside in human 
world ruling this earth for eleven thousand years." Thus Vishnu assured the gods. 
On giving boon to all gods in that way the kind-hearted god Vishnu started to think about 
the instituting base for his birth in human world. 
And then that lotus-petal-eyed one agreeing to manifest himself in fourfold way is predisposed 
towards Dasharatha to be his father. 
Then all the groups of gods, sages, gandharva-s, with rudraa-s, and apsarasa-s, extolled Vishnu 
with prayers of divine exposition. 
"Oh! Vishnu, he that fiery one who is renowned for evil acts and who is the hater of Indra, 
that Ravana is uprising furiously with his heightened arrogance, and he has become a thorn in the 
side of hermits hence he is a fright to sages, afor he tortures insubordinates to the the extent of 
loud wailing; hence we pray you to eliminate that Ravana." 
"On eliminating that furiously vainglorious Ravana with all his forces and with all his kinsmen 
neutralise the pandemonium created by him in all the worlds, and for a long time to come you 
get rid of your febrility, and you please return to your heavenly abode, namely your blameless 
and faultless Vaikuntha. Sumantra thus motivated by King Dasharatha, said these words to king "Oh! King, how and with 
which idea Sage Rishyasringa is brought by the ministers of Romapada, all that will be spoken... 
that may please be listened from me along with ministers... 
"The ministers along with clergyman have spoken this way to King Romapaada, "this is a non-harmful 
plan, well thought over by us..." 
"Rishyasringa is a forest-dweller absorbed in ascesis and self-study of Vedic scriptures, 
and he is not aware of women, or of worldly-matters or of even worldly-pleasures...
"With much desired sense-pleasing objects that will be disquieting the minds of men, we wish 
bring him to the city... Let it be decided quickly... 
"Beautiful and well decorated courtesans will go there to bring him hither by tempting with 
many a feint, and let the courtesans be given ample gifts... 
"Hearing that the King replied the priest, "Let it be so..." and then the priests and ministers 
have carried out the plan that way... 
"On hearing that order of the king those best courtesans have entered that great forest, and 
they camped not very far from that hermitage, making all the trials for showing themselves 
off to a glance of that sage. 
"Always satisfied is sage Rishyasringa to be in hermitage, thus he never stirred out of that 
hermitage, and thus he has not seen any female, or a male, or even any other objects of pleasure, 
either of city or of countryside from the time of birth onwards... 
"Then at one time Rishyasringa casually arrived at that place, and has seen those comely females. 

"They the lustful women are amazingly attired and singing melodious tunes, all of them neared 
the sage's son and spoke these words... 
"Who you are? Why you move lonely in these deep and desolate forests, why you conduct yourself 
like this? Oh! Brahman, we are interested to know... please tell us..." 
"Those women are in most desirable form and hitherto he has not seen such forms in that forest, 
hence a kind of friendship spouted, with which he is inclined to detail about his father... 

"My father is Sage Vibhandaka and I am his true descent son. I am known as Rishyasringa, by 
my name and by an event on my birth, and thus renowned on earth..."
"Our hermitage is here only, oh, august ones, I wish to perform scripturally worship to you 
all verily there..." thus said the sage to the courtesans. 
"On hearing the words of sage's son, all those courtesans are verily inclined to see the threshold 
of that hermitage, then all the women went to hermitage. 
"On going there, then the Sage's son performed worship saying "Here is our hand-wash, here 
is our feet-wash, here are our tuber fruits, here are the juicy fruits of ours... " 
"All of them have received that kind of worship much enthusiastically, but dread at the arrival 
of the sage Vibhandaka, they quickly made-up their mind to make away from there. 
" 'Take these important fruits of ours, oh, Brahman, you be safe, oh, holy one... eat them 
before long....' Said courtesans to Rishyasringa.] 
"Then all of the courtesans have embraced him and all of them with a kind of mirthfulness 
in the offing, presented sweet-balls and other varieties of best sweetmeats to him. 
"Having relished the sweets, that resplendent sage supposed them to be fruits only, for he 
did not taste sweets earlier, as he is always forest-bound. 
"Taking leave of the Sage Rishyasringa on pretence that they also have to perform devotional 
duties, they the courtesans departed from there on the pretext of their daily worship, while 
they actually feared for the arrival of Rishyasringa's father who may hurl curses on his arrival... 

"After the departure of all them the courtesans, that Brahman Rishyasringa, the grandson of 
Sage Kaashyapa, is disturbed at heart and even behaved sadly... 
"Then on the next day Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka and the prosperous sage with ascetic 
power has arrived at that place where he saw well-decorated and delightful courtesans recollecting 
in mind repetitively about them alone. 
" Then on seeing the arrival of that Brahman, the courtesans felt happy at heart, and all 
of those courtesans on surrounding him said, "oh, gentle one, welcome to the threshold of 
our hermitage... 
"There are excellent tuber fruits and fruits and there will be a very distinctive hospitality... 
definitely indeed..." So said the courtesans.
"On hearing the heart-pleasing words of all those courtesans, Rishyasringa made up his mind 
to go over there, and then those women took him away  
"While that great soul ad Brahman Rishyasringa while being brought into Anga Kingdom, then 
the Rain-god quickly showered rain in Anga kingdom to the delight of the world. 
"The king Romapada personally proceeded towards that Brahman Rishyasring who is now 
entering Anga kingdom along with rains, made prostratiion before him, offered water 
customarily with dedication, and then the king Romapada besought beneficence 
of the best sage Rishyasringa to save him and his kingdom from the fury of his father Sage Vibhandaka, 
if sage Vibhandaka were to know about this pursuit of bringing Rishyasringa to Anga 
country, at a later time ... 
"On entering the palace princess Shanta is given to Rishyasringa in customary marriage, and 
then that King Romapada obtained rejoice with a peaceful mind. 
" Thus that great fulgent Rishyasringa lived in Anga kingdom along with his wife Shanta, and 
with all his desires fulfilled and also well worshipped"  "When the god of gods Brahma left from there Bhageeratha stood on the 
			tip of his big-toe praying for the mercy of Lord Shiva for one year, 
			while that tip of his big-toe pressurised the earth." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about Bhageeratha's effort to bring Ganga to 
			earth. 
On completion of one year, he who is venerated by all worlds, the consort 
			of Uma and the god of animals from insects to humans, that god Shiva 
			revealed himself and spoke this to the king. 
Oh, best one among humans, I am delighted with your unwavering effort, 
			and I will fulfil your cherish. I will therefore sustain Ganga, the 
			daughter of king of mountains by my head. 
Afterwards, she who is reverenced by all the worlds and who is the 
			elder daughter of Himavanta, that Ganga assuming an unendurable form 
			and an insupportable rapidity, they say, then plunged from the sky onto 
			the auspicious head of Shiva. 
She who is an extremely unendurable river that goddess Ganga even speculated 
			saying to herself, 'let me enter netherworld, indeed whisking Shiva 
			with my streams.' 
Discerning her egotism god Shiva is infuriated, and then on his part 
			that Three-eyed god Shiva thought to pent her up in the tufts of his 
			head-hair. 
And oh, Rama, she that holy River Ganga swooped down into the cavernous 
			curls of matted hair-tufts on the holy head of God Shiva, and she became 
			a detainee in them. 
Though she strove hard in one way or another to reach the earth that 
			Ganga is rendered incapable, as she could not gain access for an outlet 
			from any edge of the coils of matted hair-tufts of Shiva, hence she 
			is held there in durance vile. 
Goddess Ganga whirled round and round in the coils of tufts alone for 
			many number of years, and when Ganga's emanation from those coils is 
			intangible Bhageeratha again firmed up in a marvellous penance in the 
			matter of her descent to earth. 
Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, with that ascesis of Bhageeratha god 
			Shiva is very much delighted, and thereupon he has also released Ganga 
			aiming at Bindu Lake in Himalayas. 
While god Shiva released Ganga into Bindu Lake seven streams have emerged 
			out of it, and thus three auspicious Ganga-s with holy waters have cruised 
			eastward which are known as Hlaadini, Paavani, and Nalini. 
Also thus Sucakshu, Seetha, and the excellent river Sindhu are the 
			other three rivers which streamed to the westward direction with their 
			holy waters. 
Of them the seventh Ganga flowed towards the path of Bhageeratha' chariot, 
			and that great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting in a 
			divine chariot moved ahead and even Ganga followed him. 
Thus Ganga came from heavens onto Shankara's head and from there onto 
			the earth, and there on earth her waters advanced with a tumultuous 
			sound advancing them. 
The earth then verily shone forth with the shoals of fish, schools 
			of tortoises, and scores of porpoises and other aquatic beings that 
			have already fallen and that are still falling in step with the spates 
			of Ganga. 
Later, they the gods, sages, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and the assemblages 
			of siddha-s have then seen there the swoop of Ganga in that way from 
			heaven to earth, with curiosity. 
Some of the gods with aircrafts that are like cities in their shape 
			and size, and some with horses that are prancing, and some with best 
			elephants that are staggering, at the very sight of plunging Ganga, 
			have entered the firmament at that place. 
The gods whose animation is unlimited, and who are anxious to see the 
			plunge of Ganga, have come together in assemblages, which plunge is 
			a highest marvel in the universe by a better degree of her illimitable 
			animation than that of gods who came to see, and even benignant to the 
			world in according water and salving souls, which those gods cannot 
			do. 
"The glitter of the ornaments of hosts of gods who are in stampede, 
			made the cloudless sky to shine as if it is with a hundred of suns. 
			
At that time, with the falling and rising of scores of porpoises and 
			reptiles, even with the wriggling fishes, the sky became flashy as if 
			flashes of lightning are strewn over it. 
Spattered innumerably with the whitish froth from the splashes of Ganga, 
			and stippled with the flights of swans, the sky is as though overspread 
			with silver-clouds of autumn. 
Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately, elsewhere sinuously, somewhere 
			else straightly, elsewhere sloppily, somewhere gushingly, and somewhere 
			else her cruise is leisurely and tardily. 
Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately in declivities, elsewhere 
			sinuously on zigzag lands, somewhere else straightly on uniform lands, 
			elsewhere sloppily in canting lands, somewhere gushingly in craggy lands, 
			and somewhere else her cruise is leisurely in flatlands and tardily 
			in uplands.
Somewhere her water repeatedly knocking against her own water is recurrently 
			billowing upwards only to make nosedive onto earth. 
That impeccable and immaculate water of Ganga then became outstanding 
			as it has flounced down from heaven primarily onto the head of Shankara, 
			and therefrom it has coasted down onto the earth. 
And asserting that the water as holy, because it descended touching 
			the body of Shiva, viz., the head of Shiva, the assemblages of sages, 
			gandharva-s, and those that are residents on the plane of earth have 
			sipped that water at that place. 
Also those that have fallen from heaven onto the surface of earth by 
			some curse or the other, they too became blemishless on taking head-bath 
			in the water of Ganga. 
When sins are washed away with the hallowing water of Ganga, they again 
			transited skyward and then obtained their own empyrean worlds once again. 
			
With her splendorous water people are blissful, and on taking dip-baths 
			in Ganga they are totally removed of the strains of their sins, and 
			they lived blissfully ever after. 
In this way, the great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting 
			in a divine chariot continuously moved ahead and Ganga continually followed 
			him at his behind. 
Oh, Rama, all of the gods along with the assemblages of sages, ogres, 
			monsters, demons, and even great reptiles with kinnara-s, and gandharva-s 
			with best yaksha-s, and even serpents and apsara-s, have delightfully 
			moved after Ganga who is following the chariot of Bhageeratha, and why 
			they, in fact, all of the aquatic beings have followed Ganga. 
In whichever direction king Bhageeratha has advanced, that glorious 
			River Ganga, who is the prominent river among all the rivers and the 
			complete obliterator of sins, has also moved at his behind in that direction. 
			
While in flow she started to completely inundate the field of Vedic-ritual 
			belonging to the great-souled sage Jahnu, who is of marvellous deeds 
			and who is presently an officiator of an ongoing Vedic-ritual. 
But on knowing her hubris, oh, Raghava, that sage Jahnu has become 
			irritated and causing an extreme marvel he drank off all the water of 
			Ganga. 
Thereupon, the gods along with gandharva-s and sages at that extremely 
			marvellous feat of Sage Jahnu are highly astounded, and they then started 
			to worship that ablest human and great-souled sage Jahnu, and even deigned 
			for the daughterhood of Ganga to that high-souled sage Jahnu. 
That greatly radiant and godly sage Jahnu is then delighted and released 
			Ganga from both of his ears. Therefore Ganga became the daughter of 
			sage Jahnu, and she is also renowned as Jahnavi, after the name of that 
			sage. 
Even though Ganga again proceeded moving behind the chariot of Bhageeratha 
			and reached the ocean, therefrom she had to wend her way to netherworld, 
			once dug by the sons of Sagara, only to accomplish the mission of Bhageeratha, 
			namely drenching the ashes of Sagara's sons. 
Even kingly-sage Bhageeratha making every effort ushered Ganga to netherworld, 
			but on seeing his grandparents rendered to ashes he has became doleful. 
			
"Oh, Rama, the best of Raghu's dynasty, then Ganga inundated that mound 
			of ashes of Sagara's six-thousand sons, by which those souls obtained 
			heaven, while the sins of souls are cleansed with the water of Ganga." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. "When Sage Vashishta did not yield Kaamadhenu, the milker of any desire, oh, Rama, 
then Vishvamitra started to seize it." Sage Shataananda continued the narration 
of the legend of Vishvamitra. 
While the determined king Vishvamitra dragged her away from Vashishta, oh, Rama, 
Shabala is saddened and tearfully mulled over stung by the anguish of her secession 
from the sage. 
A pitiable and highly anguished one, such as I am. I am being dragged away by 
the servants of the king. Has this great souled Sage Vashishta abandoned me, or 
what? 
'Or, did I do any misdeed towards that great sage of sacred soul whereby he is 
leaving me off. I have always been reverent and a cherished cow to that priest 
and am I no errant.' That cow eulogised in this manner. 
On thinking thus and suspiring repeatedly, oh, enemy-subjugator, Rama, then she 
that Sacred Cow hastily rushed with the speed a gust and went to that highly energetic 
Vashishta on utterly shoving off hundreds of attendants of the king who are roping 
her, and then she straight went to the base of the feet of the great-souled Vashishta. 

She that moaning and groaning Shabala staying before the Sage Vashishta spoke this 
bellowing like a thunderous cloud. 
'Oh, Son of Brahma, why I am discarded by you, whereby oh, god, the king's attendants 
are weaning me away from your proximity.' So Shabala urged Vashishta. 
When he is spoken thus, then that Brahma-sage spoke this sentence to worrisome 
Shabala, whose heart is worrying with worry, as he would speak with his own sister 
in her worriment. 
Neither I forswear you nor you fouled me, oh, Shabala, this king is forcibly 
weaning you away from me as he is beside himself with kingly arrogance. 
'My ability is not balanceable with his, isn't it. Above all, on his part he is 
a king now, and a king will be mighty, he is the lord of the land and a Kshatriya, 
and thus we have to be subservient to a Kshatriya, isn't it. 
'ThisakShauhiNiunit of army is plethoric, overcrowded 
with elephants, horses, and chariots, and overspread with flags and elephants, thereby 
he is mightier than me.' Thus Vashishta tried to pacify that Sacred-Cow. 
She who is spoken that way by Vashishta, that sententious Sacred Cow, Shabala, 
in her turn obediently spoke this sentence to that Brahma-sage of un-balanceable 
resplendence. 
'Oh, Brahman, unstated is that the might of sovereignty as mightier than the might 
of sagacity. A sage is mightier than a sovereign. A sage's might is mightiest than 
the mightier sovereign, for a sage's might is angelic.' So Shabala started talking 
to the sage. 
Immutable is your power as you are mightier than great-mighty Vishvamitra and 
invincible is your dynamism. 
'Ordain me, oh, highly resplendent sage, who am replete with the power of your 
sagacity, and I will disprove the vanity, valour, and venture of that injudicious 
king for this injudicious seizure.' Thus Shabala implored the sage Vashishta. 
Oh, Rama, when spoken by her thus, that highly glorious Vashishta said to Shabala, 
the do-all cow, 'create a power that can overpower the power of opponent.' Vashishta 
said so to Shabala.
On hearing his sentence, oh, Rama, that Sacred Cow Shabala then created Pahlava 
kings, sprang forth from her mooing 'hums', and hundreds of them annihilated the 
army of Vishvamitra in its entirety just while Vishvamitra is witnessing it. 
King Vishvamitra was utterly infuriated and with wide-eyed anger he started to 
destroy those Pahlava-s with many a kind of his weaponry. 
On seeing the subdual of hundreds of Pahlava-s by Vishvamitra, then the Sacred 
Cow again generated deadly Shaka-s hobnobbed with Yavana-s through her mooing 'hums'. 

Then the earth was pervaded with the Shaka-s associated with Yavana-s, who have 
effectuation and bravery in overcoming their enemy forces, and who are golden in 
bodily colour similar to the golden pistils of flowers which complexion is outlandish. 

Yavana-s and Shaka-s, who are wielding bowie knives and broad lances and who are 
clad in golden coloured dresses, and who looked like glowing fires have completely 
burnt down entire force of Vishvamitra. 
"Then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra indeed released his missiles, by which 
Yavana-s, Kaambhoja-s, and the Barbara-s, are rendered helter-skelter." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra. "On observing that his sons have gone long time back in search of ritual-horse, 
			oh, Rama, king Sagara spoke this to his grandson, Amshuman, who is radiant 
			with his own self-resplendence." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration 
			about Sagara. 
'You are brave one and completed your education in warfare, such as 
			you are, you are a coequal to your paternal-uncles in magnificence, 
			thus you search the course of your paternal uncles, also him by whom 
			the horse is stolen.' Thus King Sagara started speaking to his grandson 
			Amshuman. 
The living beings in netherworlds of earth are intrepid and they 
			are extraordinary also, hence you take your bow along with your sword 
			to retaliate them in the event of their attacking you. 
'On saluting them that are worthy for salutations, and on eliminating 
			them that are the causer of obstructions, you shall achieve your purpose 
			of tracking the ritual-horse, and thus you comeback safely and let my 
			Vedic-ritual be crossed over to the other shore of mortality by you.' 
			Thus king Sagara told his grandson Amshuman. 
When the great-souled king Sagara has thoroughly said in this way, 
			that adroitly agile Amshuman proceeded wielding a bow and a sword. 
Motivated by the King Sagara, oh, Rama, the best one among men, Amshuman 
			progressed on the walkway that was hollowed out by his great-souled 
			paternal-uncles inside the earth. 
And he that resplendent Amshuman beheld one of the four directional 
			elephant of the earth which is being venerated by gods, monsters, demons, 
			imps, vultures and serpents. 
On circumambulating that elephant in supplication, and even on enquiring 
			after its well-being, he that Amshuman has enquired in detail with it 
			for his paternal-uncles and even about the robber of the ritual-horse. 
			
On hearing that enquiry of Amshuman that directional elephant with 
			great perception replied on its part saying, 'oh Amshuman, son of Asamanja, 
			on achieving your mission you will return expeditiously along with the 
			horse'. 
On hearing that word of that directional elephant he departed from 
			there, and on sequentially reaching other directional elephants that 
			are abiding in other directions of earth, he commenced to ask the same 
			enquiry which he made with the first, according to the positioning of 
			elephants in directions, and according to the established procedures 
			of their venerability. 
All the elephants that safeguard the directions of earth which have 
			the faculties of articulation and eloquence have adored Amshuman and 
			motivated him by saying, 'you will be going from here taking the horse.' 
			
On hearing that common blessing of all the directional-elephants, he 
			that nimble-footed Amshuman has gone to the place where his paternal-uncles, 
			sons of Sagara, were rendered as mounds of ashes. 
But he on whom the control of anguish has chanced for not physically 
			seeing his paternal-uncles, that son of Asamanja then wept, as he is 
			highly agonised and extremely anguished at their destruction. 
That tigerly-man Amshuman who is overwhelmed by agony and anguish, 
			also beheld there the horse of Vedic-ritual that is grazing nearby. 
			
When he that great resplendent Amshuman wanted to offer obsequial waters 
			to the departed sons of Sagara and searched for water he has not found 
			any fount of water. 
Spanning his expert glances, oh, Rama, he then saw the rapid-winged 
			king of birds, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, who is the 
			maternal uncle of his father and other paternal-uncles, and whose flight 
			will be similar to that of the Wind-god. 
That great-mighty son of Lady Vinata, namely Garuda, also spoke this 
			word to Amshuman, 'do not bemoan, oh, tigerly-man, this eradication 
			of your paternal-uncles is worthwhile to the worlds'. 
In fact, Kapila, the Imponderable Sage, has burnt down those great-mighty 
			paternal-uncles of yours, oh, observant Amshuman, as such it will not 
			be apt of you to offer the mundane obsequial water-oblations to them, 
			indeed. 
'Oh, best one among men, River Ganga is the elder daughter of 
			Himavanta, and oh, dextrous one, you have to offer water-oblation to 
			the departed paternal-uncles of yours in her waters, namely the holy 
			waters of River Ganga'. 
World purifier River Ganga will drift them who are rendered as mounds 
			of ashes to heaven, and when she who is much adored by all worlds drenches 
			this ash, that River Ganga herself will lead the sixty-thousand sons 
			of Sagara to heaven. 
'Oh, great fortunate one, oh, best one among men, you may proceed 
			from here with the horse, oh, brave one, it will be apt of you to carry 
			out the Vedic-ritual of your grandfather.' Thus Garuda said to Amshuman. 
			
On hearing the words of that great-winged eagle, Garuda, he that highly 
			brave and well-renowned Amshuman swiftly took the horse, and returned 
			to the ritual place of his grandfather, king Sagara. 
Then on reaching the King Sagara, who is under the vow of the ritual, 
			oh, Rama, Amshuman described what all has happened and even the words 
			of Garuda. 
On hearing those unendurable words from Amshuman, the king Sagara firstly 
			completed the Vedic-ritual scripturally and procedurally. 
On completing the Vedic-ritual King Sagara arrived at his capital, 
			but that king could not arrive at a decision about the arrival of Ganga 
			to the earth. 
"That great king Sagara could not get at any resolve in getting Ganga 
			to earth even after a long time, and on ruling kingdom for thirty-thousand 
			years he went to heaven." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
			the ancestors of Rama. On listening the narration of Vishvamitra, Rama, the delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty is highly rejoiced, and at the end of the episode he spoke to 
			sage whose glow is fire like. 
I am interested to listen this episode exhaustively, oh, Brahman, let 
			good betide you, how my ancestor Sagara had completed the Vedic-ritual, 
			really. 
On listening the words of Rama that are inclusive of his inquisitiveness, 
			Sage Vishvamitra smilingly spoke to that descendent of Kakutstha, "oh, 
			Rama, let the episode of the great-souled Sagara be listened vividly." 
			Vishvamitra thus commenced to narrate that episode. 
The father-in-law of god Shankara who is well-known by the name of 
			Himavan sets eyes on Mt. Vindhya, which stands as loftily as Himalayas, 
			and those two mountains peer at each other. 
Oh, best one among men, Rama, that Vedic-ritual of Sagara started 
			in between those two mountains, namely Himalayas and Vindhya ranges, 
			and oh, tigerly-man Rama, that area is renowned for Vedic-rituals, isn't 
			it! 
Oh, dear sire Rama, the grandson of Sagara and the son of exiled Asamanja 
			is Amshuman, oh, descendant of Kakutstha, which Anshuman's bow will 
			be unfaltering and who is a top-speeded chariot-rider, and he has escorted 
			ritual-horse released. 
And on the day of a sacred function calledukthyam, Indra assumed the form of a demon and stole the ritual horse of the 
			chief of the ritual, namely Sagara. 
While that ritual-horse of the great-souled Sagara is stolen, all the 
			congregations of the Ritviks, the religious-teachers, then spoke to 
			the chief propitiator, namely Sagara. 
'Oh, Sagara,the descendent of Kakutstha, at this auspicious time the 
			ritual horse is hastily diverted, you kill him who stole the horse, 
			and let that horse be fetched'. 
'This hindrance in Vedic-ritual will become inauspicious for all of 
			us, thereby, oh, king, action may be taken as to how there can be no 
			fault in proceedings of the ritual.' The religious-teachers of Sagara 
			have advised him in this way. 
On hearing the words of religious-teachers that king Sagara indeed 
			spoke this much to his sixty thousand sons in that religious-council. 
			
'Oh, sons, I do not envisage any way in for demons into this ritual, 
			since oh, best ones among men, holy-sanctifiers who themselves are sanctified 
			by the Vedic-hymns are conducting this glorious Vedic-ritual, isn't 
			it. 
'Oh, sons, you may therefore proceed to search for the horse and its 
			thief on entire earth as far as it is garlanded by the ocean, and safety 
			betides you all. 
'Oh, sons, let each prince advance searching one square yojana of 
			earth, by my order you dig up the earth until the appearance of the 
			horse, while searching for the stealer of that horse. 
'As for myself, I will stay here only along with my grandson, namely 
			Amshuman, and with the congregation of religious-teachers till the horse 
			appears, as I am under vow of the ritual.' Thus Sagara instructed to 
			his sixty thousand sons and stayed back at the ritual place. 
Animated by their father's words those great-mighty princes enthusiastically 
			proceeded onto earth's surface in the preliminary round of search. 
But, oh, tigerly-man Rama, on going round the earth in its entirety 
			those great-mighty princes did not find that horse, then as said by 
			their father they mapped the earth to a unit of one square yojana for 
			each of them, and each of them hollowed out each and every area on the 
			surface of earth with their arms that have the touch of the diamonds. 
			
Mother Earth bewailed while she is ruptured with spears also that are 
			similar to thunderbolts, besides with very gruelling ploughs. 
Oh, Raghava, there emerged an unbearable rumpus from the serpents, 
			asura-s, demons, and other beings living underneath the surface of earth, 
			while they are killed during hollowing the earth. 
Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, thus sixty thousand square 
			yojana-s of the earth is dug over, so as to make the earth's outermost 
			plane as the unsurpassedrasaatala, the 
			sixth subterranean and the nethermost plane. 
Oh, the tigerly king Rama, the sons of Sagara have endeavoured everywhere 
			digging over the Jambu Island which is verily congested with mountains 
			in this way. 
All the gods along with gandharva-s, asura-s, and reptiles who are 
			distraught at heart for the plight of earth have approached the Forefather, 
			Brahma. 
They the gods who are very highly scared, and who are chap-fallen, 
			then spoke this sentence to the great-souled Forefather Brahma on gaining 
			his grace. 
'Oh, god Brahma, the sons of Sagara are digging entire earth, thus 
			aquatic beings and many great-souls are being destroyed. 
" 'This one is the destroyer of our ritual... this one has carried off 
			our ritual horse...' thinking thus and suspecting everyone those sons 
			of Sagara are torturing all the living beings.' Thus all the gods have 
			appealed to Brahma." So said Sage Vishvamitra to Rama and others. " I am delighted Rama, safe you be, oh Lakshmana, well-contended I am for you have
come to pay respects to me along with Seetha. 
"The well-worn trail of yours on pathway is strenuousness and painful for you two,
and it is evident from the sweat above your necks, even much more for Janaka's daughter, Maithili.

"She is delicate and not discomforted by such distresses earlier, yet motivated by
her friendship she came to these highly detrimental forests. 
"In which way Seetha takes delight in these forests, Rama, that you may ensure
to her, for she has done an impossible deed in following you to forests, an impossible deed for
womenfolk, in general. 
"From the beginning of creation the nature of women is this way only, oh scion of
Raghu, they devote themselves to their men in good fortune, but they leave them off in ill fortune.

"With the mercuriality of hundreds of streaks of thunderbolt and with the
incisiveness of a weapon, and with the speediness of an eagle or the gusty wind, the women are
conformable. 
"But she this wife of yours is devoid of all those stigmas, an exemplary and an
estimable lady, like Lady Arundhati. 
"Where you wish to put up along with Lakshmana and with this Seetha, oh,
enemy-destroyer Rama, that province shall be glorified." So said Sage Agastya to Rama."

Thus said by the sage, Raghava spoke amiable this sentence adjoining his palms to
the sage who is glowing like a ritual-fire. 
"I am privileged and blessed as my mentor and the eminent age is well pleased with
the virtues of my brother and wife which are non-dissimilar to mine. 
"But a place with water and many forests may please be shown, where I can reside
happily and self-composedly on erecting a hermitage." Thus Rama asked the Sage Agastya.

Then that eminent sage Agastya on contemplating a while about what Rama has said,
that virtuous and confident sage spoke more ideational word to Rama. 
"A most prosperous place called Panchavati is there at a distance of two yojana-s
from here, oh, dear Rama, which is abundant with tubers, fruits, water, and many deer." Thus
Agastya started to tell. 
"On your going there along with Saumitri, and on erecting a hermitage you may
take delight in there complying the decreed order of your father. 
"Indeed all of this episode of yours is known to me, oh, merited one, by the
ability of my asceticism, and also by my friendship with Dasharatha. 
"I am in the know of your heartfelt certitude by my ascesis, thereby I wish to
advise you to go to Panchavati, though I said that you may dwell in these ascetic-woods along with
me. 
"That woodland will be delightful, isn't it Raghava, for it is praiseworthy and not
very far off from here, and Seetha can take delight in there. 
"There Maithili will take delight nearby River Godavari, and it is with abundant
tubers, fruits, various are its bird flocks, and it is very reclusive too, oh, great dextrous Rama,
further it is meritorious and appealing. 
"Even you, Rama, with your good deportment are capable to safeguard the hermits
while residing there. 
"Oh, brave one, you see this great forest of flower-liquor trees, you have to
proceed north of it and advance towards a banyan tree. 
"Then on climbing up an upland a mountain is seen, that which is also not far away,
and that renowned Panchavati is there in an ever-blooming forest in the valley of that mountain."
Said Sage Agastya to Rama. 
When thus said by Sage Agastya, Rama along with Soumitri venerated and bade farewell
to that truth advocator sage Agastya. 
Thus well bidden by Sage Agastya those two Rama and Lakshmana have offered their
venerations at the feet of that sage and proceeded to their prospective hermitage at Panchavati
along with Seetha. 
Those princes that are dauntless in war took up their bows and braced up their
quivers, and resolutely proceeded to Panchavati on the route apprised by that great sage Agastya.
Approaching Rama standing absorbed in fight in the battle-field, exhausted as he was
by the fight, and seeing Ravana who came nearby, facing him duly prepared for the battle, the
glorious sage, Agastya, who had come together with the gods, to perceive the battle, then spoke as
foolows:
"O Rama, the mighty armed! Hear the following eternal secret, by which you can
conquer all the enemies in battle, my child!"
"Worship the sun-god, the ruler of the worlds, who is crowned with the rays, who
appears at the horizon, who is greeted by the gods and the demons alike, shines forth; covering up
all other lights and brings light to the world."
"He is the embodiment of all gods, full of glory and the reflector of rays. He
protects the multitude of gods and demons as well as their worlds by his rays."
"He is Brahma the creator, Vishnu the protector of the Universe, Lord Shiva the god
of destruction, Skanda (son of Lord Shiva), Prajapati (the ten lords of creted beings), Indra the
ruler of gods, Kubera the bestower of riches, Kala the Time-spirit, Yama the god of retribution,
Soma the moon-god and Varuna the ruler of the waters."
"The Pitrus (manes), the eight Vasus, the twelve Sadhyas, the two Ashvins the
physicians of gods, the fortymine Maruts (wind-gods), Manu (a progenitor of the human race), Vayu
the wind-god, the fire-god, the created beings, the life-breath of the universe, the source of teh
seasons and the store-house of light."
"An off-spring of Aditi, the progenitor of all, Surya the sun-god and the provocator
of acts in people, the courser in the sky, the nourisher of all iwth rain, the possessor of rays
the golden, the brilliant, having golden seed whose energy constitutes the seed of the universe and
the maker of the day."
"He has seven green horses, is thousand-rayed, full of rays, the destroyer of
darkness, the source of happiness, maker of thinness, the infuser of life in the lifeless cosmic
egg and radiant."
"He is a golden foetus, maker of coolness, creator of heat, the bringer of a day,
the one who is eulogized by all, pregnant with fire, the son of Aditi, the one who pacifies himself
in the evening and the destroyer of frost."
"He is the lord of the sky, the disperser of darkness, the master of the three Vedas
(Viz. Rik, Sama and Yajur), the sender of thick rain, the friend of water and the on who courses
swiftly in the path of the sky."
"He is the radiator of heat and adrned with a circle of rays. He is death himself,
tawny of hue, a giver of warmth to all, omniscent, all-formed, endowed with extra-ordinary
splendour, the one who has an affection in all and the source of all evolutes."
"He is the controller of all lunar mansions, planets and stars, the creator of all
and the resplendent among the splendid. O god, appearing in twelve forms (in the shape of twelve
months in a year), hail to you."
"Hail to you in the form of eastern mountain and hail to the western mountain. Hail
to the lord of host of luminaries and hail to the lord of the day."
"Hail to you, the giver of victory, hail to you, the joy born of victory! Hail to
you, the god with green horses, hail to you, having thousands of rays! Hail, hail to you the son of
Aditi!
"Hail to you, the fierce one, hail to you the valiant one! Hail to you, the one with
variegated colours! Hail to you, the awakener of the louts, hail to you, the furious one!"
"Hail to you, the ruler of Brahma, Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu the infallible, the
sun-god, the light indwelling the solar orb, the resplendent one, the devourer of all, appearing in
form of Rudra."
"Hail to you, the dispeller of darkness, the destroyer of cold, the exterminator of
foes, the one whose extent in immeasurable, the destroyer of the ungrateful, the god, who is the
ruler of all lights."
"Hail to you, possessing the lustre of refined gold, the dispeller of ignorance, the
architect of the universe, the uprooter of darkness, the splendour incarnate, the onlooker of the
world!'"
"This sun, the lord alone destroys and brings into existence all the brings. He
radiates heat by his rays. He sends the rain."
"Planted in all created beings, he remains awake, when they have fallen asleep. He
alone is the oblation to the fire-god and the fruit attained by those who pour such oblations."
"He comprises all the gods, as well as the sacrifies as also the fruit of all
sacrifices. He is a supremely competent one of all activities, which are found in all the
worlds."
"O Rama! No individual glorifying this sun-god, in distresses in difficulties; in
the woods or in times of peril, comes to grief."
"Worship this sun-god, the lord of the universe and the god of all gods with
undivided attention. Muttering this praise three times, you will come out victorious in
battles."
"You will be able to kill Ravana at this very moment, O mighty armed one!" Saying
so, the sage, Agastya, thereupon, left as in the same way as he had come.
Hearing this, Rama of extra ordinary energy, then became bereft of anguish. Feeling
greatly delighted, Rama retained that hymn in his memory with a devoted mind.
Sipping the water thrice and getting purified looking intently on the orb of the sun
and repeating this prayer, the valiant Rama obtained a great rejoice. Seizing hold of his bow and
seeing Ravana, Rama felt delighted in mind and marched forward for the fight. He stood voed to kill
Ravana, with an intense and all-sided effort.
Seeing Rama with a delighted mind, and becoming most exhildrated on foreseeing the
death of Ravana, the sun-god, standing in the middle of a troop of celestials, exclaimed, "Hasten
up."Having stayed that night there, those princes the annihilators of enemies,
thereafter offered salutation to the sage Bharadwaja and proceeded towards that mountain of Chitrakuta.
That great sage Bharadwaja performed a religious rite ensuring a sage journey
(scattering boiled rice on the ground and invoking blessing through the repetition of certain sacred texts0 for them. Perceiving them setting out for the journey, the sage accompanied them for a distance, as a father would do for his sons (and daughter-in-law).
Bharadwaja the great sage with a remarkable splendour began to speak the following words to Rama the truly brave man.
"After approaching Oh, the best of men! The confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, follow the river Yamuna which takes to the direction of west."
"Reaching the River Yamuna belonging to olden times, having a rapid stream and
perceiving in it a passage for descent into the river, which is too much frequented the river, which is too much frequented, you cross the River Yamuna (the daughter of the sun-god) by preparing a raft there, Oh Rama!"
After crossing the river Yamuna and approaching a large banyan tree named Syama
(dark-green) having green leaves surrounded by many tress and visited by Siddhas, Seetha should, joining her palms, recite her auspicious prayers to the tree."
"Having approached that tree, you can stay there or go beyond it. After going only for two miles from there, you will see a beautiful forest blue in colour with bamboo trees touching upon Yamuna river and interspersed with Sallaka and jujube trees."
"It is the way to Chitrakuta. I visited that place many times. It is beautiful,
endowed with serenity and free from forest-fire."
Having thus informed the way and ebbing urged by Rama to return after he had paid
obeisance to the sage and Rama having replied  so be it', the great sage Bharadwaja returned.
That sage having returned, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: "Oh Lakshmana! We are fortunate that the sage has shown compassion towards us."
Deliberating thus, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men who were highly
intelligent, headed for the river Yamuna guarding Seetha still in front.
Having reached the River Yamuna, running with rapid stream, all of them then plunged into a thought of how to cross those river-waters.
Then, Rama and Lakshmana prepared a big raft with pieces of timber fastened
together, covered with a kind of grass and spread over with dry bamboo canes.
Thereafter, the valiant Lakshmana made for Seetha a comfortable seat, after chopping branches of reeds and of rose apple tree.
Then Rama the son of Dasaratha helped Seetha his beloved consort who was
unimaginable like the goddess of fortune and who was feeling shy a little- to mount the raft.
Rama kept the two robes the jewellery, a shovel and a basket by the side of Seetha in the raft there, along with weapons.
Those valiant sons of Dasaratha firmly held that raft, firstly helped Seetha to
ascend it and then ferried across the river watchfully.
Having arrived at the middle of Yamuna river, Seetha offered salutation to the river and prayed as follows: "Oh, goddess of Yamuna! Adieu! I am crossing you! May my husband complete his vow! When Rama safely comes back again towards the city of Ayodhya, ruled by Ikshvaku kings I shall propitiate you by offering a thousand cows and a hundred drinking vessels."
Seetha of excellent complexion thus praying with joined palms to Yamuna River,
forthwith reached the southern side of the river.
Thus, by the raft, Seetha Rama and lakshmaNa crossed the River Yamuna, which flows briskly, wreathed with waves, with many trees born on its bank and having rays for it reflection.
They, who have crossed the river, abandoned the raft and march through the
river-forest of Yamuna and reached a cool banyan tree called Syama having green leaves.
Having approached that banyan tree, Seetha spoke these words, "Oh, great tree!
Obeisance to you! Let my husband complete his vow! Let me see again Kausalya and the illustrious Sumitra." Thus speaking, Seetha circumambulated that tree with joined palms.
Seeing the irreproachable Seetha, who was beloved and obedient to him thus praying, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows:
"Oh, Lakshmana, the excellent of men! You take Seetha and proceed in the front. I,along with weapons, will follow you behind."
"Give to Seetha whatever fruit or flower she desires it and wherever this Seetha's mind finds delight."
Seetha who was walking in the middle of both of them was like an auspicious female elephant in the middle of two elephants.
That Seetha asked Rama whenever she saw the one or the other tree or a bush or a
creeper shining with flowers which was not seen earlier.
Duly grasping Seetha's words; Lakshmana brought to her many kinds of beautiful twigs of trees, full of flowers.
Then Seetha the daughter of King Janaka was please to see the River Yamuna with
wonderful sands and waters re-echoing to the cry of swans and cranes.
Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and
Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.
Having strolled in the charming forest, mad noisy by a number of peacocks and which was inhabited by elephants and monkeys and reaching an agreeable level ground at the bank of the river wearing an undejected look finally sought for an abode for the night."On hearing the words of gods, the esteemed Forefather Brahma spoke 
			to them, who are very highly scared, and bewildered by the might of 
			Sagara's sons for they are effectuating the end of all beings." Vishvamitra 
			thus continued his narration. 
To whom this Mother Earth belongs in all her entirety, he is that 
			prescient Vasudeva, and she is also the consort of that Maadhava, and 
			that Vishnu eternally props up Mother Earth. Hence, that reverential 
			Vishnu donning the semblance of Sage Kapila will burn down the sons 
			of emperor Sagara to ashes in a fire of fury. 
'Even the complete cleavage of the earth, and the complete ruination 
			of Sagara's sons as well, are envisaged by the providentially farsighted 
			ancients." So said Brahma to gods. 
On hearing the words of the Forefather Brahma all the thirty three 
			gods went away with utmost satisfaction, as they have came. 
When the sons of Sagara are digging the earth then there emerged an 
			unbearable noise similar to the crashing of a thunder. 
Then on hollowing the entire earth, and on making trips around her 
			without finding the horse, all of the sons of Sagara have come together 
			and on going to their father they spoke these words to him. 
'Entire earth is trekked and mighty beings like gods, demons, monsters, 
			evil-spirits, fiends, serpents, naga-s are also eliminated, but we have 
			not seen the ritual-horse or its stealer. What we have to do next. Let 
			a thought be given in this matter. Let safeness betide you.' So said 
			those princes to their father Sagara. 
On hearing that sentence of his sons, oh, Rama, descendent of Raghu, 
			that exalted king Sagara infuriately spoke these words. 
'Let the earth be dug further, may safety be with you, and verily 
			splitting open the surface of the earth you catch hold of the thief 
			of the horse, and on achieving your purpose you may return to me.' In 
			this way Sagara ordered his sons. 
On catching up the words of their father, the great-souled Sagara, 
            his sixty thousand sons rushed towards the surface of therasaatala, 
            the netherworld. 
While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly 
			elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth's 
			surface on its head. 
Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha 
			is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests 
			on its head. 
On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant 
			moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will 
			occur on earth. 
They circumambulated the great elephant in supplication, oh Rama, and 
			on worshipping that elephant which is the protector of easterly direction 
			they proceeded to netherworld duly splitting the earth. 
After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern 
			direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that 
			is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly 
			side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable 
			character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. 
			
On circumabulating that elephant Mahaapada in supplication, they the 
			sixty thousand sons of great-souled Sagara scooped out the westerly 
			direction. 
Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld 
			an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called 
			Sumanasa. 
Circumambulating that elephant namely Sumanasa in western side, and 
			even on asking about its well-being, then they reached the northern 
			direction duly digging the earth. 
In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white 
			elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth. 
			
On touching that elephant reverently and also circumambulating it, 
			those sixty thousands sons of Sagara further burrowed to the surface 
			of the earth. 
The sons of Sagara have then gone to the auspicious northeast direction,iishaana-digbhaaga, Shiva-sthaana, and 
			all those sons of Sagara have tunnelled the earth rancorously. 
But all those great-souled and great-mighty ones with terrible dash 
			have seen the Infinite Vasudeva in the form of sage Kapila there in 
			the northeast, and oh, descendant of Raghu, they have also seen the 
			ritual-horse moving nearby that sage Kapila, thus all of the sons of 
			Sagara obtained a matchless delight. 
The eyes of the princes are agitated in fury in construing the sage 
			Kapila as the stealer of ritual-horse, and they furiously dashed towards 
			him wielding crowbars, ploughs, and various trees and boulders, and 
			shouting at him, 'stay, stay.' 
You the malicious one, you have indeed stolen our ritual-horse, and 
			in fact, you should know that we who arrived here are the sons of Sagara.' 
			Thus Sagara's sons shouted at sage Kapila. 
On hearing their words, oh, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, then sage 
			Kapila is beset with high wrath, and he boomed a 'hum' sound at them. 
			
"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, then that great-souled sage Kapila, rather Vishnu 
			with unimaginable power, has rendered all of those sons of Sagara as 
			heaps of ashes by virtue of his 'hum' sound." Thus Sage Vishvamitra 
			is narrating the legend of Sagara to Rama and others. On listening the grand and detailed sentences of that King the lion Dasharatha, 
			the great resplendent Sage Vishvamitra is thrilled with happiness and spoke this 
			way. 
"Oh, tigerly king, to you befitting are these words and to none else, as you are 
			born in a great dynasty and tutored by Vashishta. 
"What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, 
			oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises. 
"These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, 
			oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that 
			ritual. 
"At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained 
			demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams 
			of meat and blood. 
"When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the 
			ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. 
"And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall 
			be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, 
			isn't it. 
"As such, oh, tigerly king, it will be apt of you spare the services of that brave 
			one whose valour itself is his truthfulness, that youngling whose hair locks are 
			all the more jet black like crow wings on either side of his head, spare that 
			eldest son of yours, namely Rama. 
"Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual 
			by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. 
"I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown 
			in all the three worlds, no doubt about it. 
"Those two demons will be rendered incapable to stand fast on affronting Rama 
			in anywise, and none other than Raghava has the fortitude to eliminate those two. 
			
"Those two sinners that are berserk by their vigour have gone into the subjection 
			of death's noose, oh tigerly king, cannot counterbalance the great-souled Rama. 
			
"It will be unapt of you to show your paternal fondness, oh, king, upon my oath, 
			be assured that those two demons are eradicated. 
"I am sensible of that sublime-soul Rama, whose valour is his truthfulness, and 
			even this great resplendent Vashishta and these saints that are here are aware. 
			
"If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown 
			on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. 
"Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite 
			headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. 
"It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for 
			ten days of the ritual without temporising. 
"I wish you to take decision as to how my ritual's time is not lapsed, and 
			let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve." Thus Vishvamitra 
			said to Dasharatha. 
On saying those words that comprise fairness and meaningfulness that virtue-souled 
			great saint with great resplendence paused. 
On hearing the propitious words of sage Vishvamitra that best king Dasharatha 
			shuddered and swooned as he is muffled up with profound adversity, and after that 
			on regaining consciousness he sunk down in fear. 
This way on hearing that word of the saint Vishvamitra which is explicitly slitting 
			his mind and heart that illustrious and noble-souled king Dasharatha then became 
			highly annoyed at heart, and flustered extremely in his throne. A word about this and the next four chapters. These chapters do not find
a place in various other mms, besides having some contradictory statements in their verses. Hence,
these are said to be interpolated chapters. However, if it is questioned as to why they are still
being incorporated in translations, despite the irregularities noticed, for this the reply is
'because most ancient commentators have given elaborate commentaries on them they are stetted...'
and thus these chapters are held valid.
On hearing the words of that kingly eagle Sampaati that are relishable like
ambrosia, then those best fly-jumpers are gladdened and rejoiced. 
Then the best fly-jumper Jambavanta got up along with all of the fly-jumpers from
the surface of the earth on which they sat for self-immolation, and spoke to the kingly eagle Sampaati.

"You please tell vividly as to where is Seetha, who has seen her, who has
abducted Maithili, and thus you help all these forest-dwellers. 
"Who is inadvertent of the onslaught of Rama's arrows, or of those that are
personally bolted by Lakshmana, which arrows will be falling with the speed of thunderbolts?" Thus,
Jambavanta and others asked Sampaati. 
Sampaati is gladdened at the monkeys who refrained from self-immolation, and he
gladly said this sentence to them to cheer them up who are now contemplating listening about
Seetha. 
"I will now narrate how I have listened about the abduction of Vaidehi, by
whom it is said to me, and where that wide-eyed Seetha is... 
"At one time I fell on this impassable mountain which is breadth-wise in many
yojana-s, whereupon my age has advanced and my liveliness and forcefulness have slackened...

"My son who is the best one among all birds, and who is named Supaarshva by his
name is sustaining me who am deteriorated to dire straits, with timely sustenance... 
"Passion is exigent to the celestial-artists Gandharva-s, aggression is exigent to
snakes, fear is exigent to deer, like that hunger is exigent to us, the eagles... 
"On some day when hunger was aching me and I was aching for food, my son Supaarshva
turned up without flesh when the sun of the day went down... 
"I reproved him as I was deprived of food, and my son who is an enhancer of my
gladness pacified me and said this sentence about what had happened ... 
" 'Oh, father, I as a desirer of flesh flew up to skies in time and overspreading
the Mt. Mahendra, I very well hovered on it... 
" 'I have been hovering there looking downward to completely impede the pathway of
thousands of underwater beings of the ocean on my own... 
" 'There I have seen someone who in simile is like a shoved heap of mascara and he
is going away captivating a lady who equals the aurora in her shine. 
" 'On seeing two of them I resolved to use them up for food, but he
benignly, basely and beggarly be sought way-leave for their traversal... 
" 'There will be none assaulting those that entreat in a beggarly manner, even
someone among base people, isn't it? Then what else is to be said of my kind, aha! 
" 'He hastily went away as though enshrouding the skies with his vigour, and then
the beings that move in the firmament have approached and applauded me... 
" 'The great-sages who approached me in firmament have said to me, 'fortunately
Seetha is alive, somehow he that Ravana has gone away with Seetha who is to be protected by
one and all like you, anyhow you are blest without a doubt... 
" 'Then those siddha-s, the celestial sages, have informed me on showing her whose
ornaments and ochry-silk-sari are disorderly, and who is vanquished by the speediness of her
anguish, and who is yelling both the names of Rama and Lakshmana, as the wife of Dasharatha's Rama,
the daughter of Janaka. They have also informed on showing him who is abducting her as Ravana, the
king of demons. 
" 'And hence, oh, father, the lapse of time in my returning home...' thus that best
sentence maker Supaarshva informed me all the drift in its entirety..." Thus Sampaati is continuing
his narration to monkeys. 
"Even on listening it has not come to my mind to dare Ravana. How a wingless
the bird can initiate any action, indeed! 
"But that which is possible for me to do is advising as a votary with the qualities
of thinking and advising. Let it be heard as I narrate and in that matter of translating my
information into action, it certainly depends on your bravery. 
"Indeed with my analysis and information to you, I wish to make all of you exuberant
as I deem that I have done my bit, because whatever task of Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is there
that task is mine too. There is no doubt bout it. 
"Thereby, I reckon you as the best ones by your aptitude, fortitude, and attitude,
and as invincible ones even for gods, hence Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, shepherded you...

"What is more, the excruciating eagle-feathered arrows of Rama and Lakshmana are
enough to give defence or offence to all three worlds. 
"Perchance that Decahedral demon is definitely a powerful and prideful demon. But,
as capable vanara-s, there is nothing impossible to you, even in the least. 
"Thereby, enough is the time-lapse and make a mental determination. Adventurers and
prudent souls of your kind with not backslide in tasks, isn't it? "That expert in sentences, namely sage Nishaakara, entered his dwelling on
saying these and many other words of encouragement after permitting me to take leave.

"But on creeping slowly and slowly from the cave of that mountain I clambered up the
Mt. Vindhya I am looking forward to your arrival... 
"As of now, a little more than a hundred years have slipped by, and I am awaiting
events and times minding sage's words in my heart... 
"But many illogical thoughts crowded around me when Sage Nishaakara went on great
voyage to heaven, thus my anguish burned me down... 
"I have been reversing the thought that cropped up for my suicide by virtue of the
afflatus endowed to me by that sage, and I have been safeguarding my lives as that afflatus is
taking away my anguish, as a tongue of flaring fire takes away darkness... 
"Though I am aware of the valour of that dirty-minded Ravana, I was rebuking my son
saying, 'How you have not saved Maithili?' 
"My son has not effectuated my cherish even on hearing the bewail of Seetha, or at
least on hearing that Rama and Lakshmana are separated from Seetha, or at least on knowing my
friendship with Dasharatha..." Thus Sampaati spoke to monkeys. 
Both the wings of Sampaati have then cropped up just before the eyes of those
monkeys who are clustering around him, while Sampaati is speaking in this way to those monkeys...

On looking at his own body which is now covered with newborn reddish-feathered wings
Sampaati obtained an incomparable rejoice, and he also said this to vanara-s. 
By the efficacy of that kingly sage of illimitable magnificence both the wings of
Sampaati that were burnt down by sunrays have resurfaced again. 
"Which valour, vigour, and valiance were prevailing in my youth, now I am
experiencing them alone... 
"Let an endeavour be made by all of you. For sure, you will come by Seetha. This
event of my regaining wings shall be the causer of credibility in you all... 
On saying thus to all of those monkeys that the best bird Sampaati took wing from that
mountaintop to ascertain the plight of a sky-going bird when anew on the wing. 
On hearing that word of Sampaati those tigers monkeys are heartily gladdened and
while their valour inspires them they have become proactive towards their task. 
Those best fly-jumpers having redeemed their certitude, then with a gusty gusto
waited for an opportune time called Abhijit Lagna and then journeyed
on to the southern direction, as they are the pioneers in searching for Seetha, the daughter of Janaka.
At which mountain's tableland those monkeys sat down for self-immolation, to that
area the elder brother of Jataayu, a kingly eagle known as Sampaati by name, one renowned for
his forcefulness and aggressiveness, and a celebrated and sempiternal sky-flying eagle has arrived.

On coming out of the cave of the great-mountain Vindhya, Sampaati is gladdened at
heart to see the monkeys sitting down there, and he spoke these words. 
"Whether it is good or bad, fate indeed follows humans in this world procedurally,
why because this fated and long-waited food has now come nigh of me... 
"I wish to eat them frugally, killing one by one and eating one by one, preying on
one on one day, and then preying upon the other on the other day..." thus that bird spoke those
words on seeing the massy fly-jumpers. 
On hearing the words of that gormandizing bird, Angada became highly breathless and
then spoke to Hanuma. 
"Look! In the name of an eagle, the son of the Sun, Yama, the Terminator, has
manifestly arrived at this area for the fatality of monkeys... thus ill luck is still haunting
us... 
"We fulfilled neither Rama's task, nor the decree of our king, but this unknown
catastrophe has abruptly bechanced for the monkeys... 
"You all have heard in its entirety what deed the kingly Jataayu has done wishing to
do good to Vaidehi... 
"Like that, all beings, even those birthed in animality, are doing what that is
agreeable to Rama even on forgoing their own lives, as with us... 
"Even animals will be mutually succoring by their instinct of concern and
camaraderie, therefore, let each of us leave off our souls, soulfully... 
"Conscientious Jataayu has done a deed much liked by Rama, and we too have been
trekking the forests without caring even for our lives in the cause of Rama, but we have not seen
Maithili... 
"He that kingly eagle Jataayu who is killed by Ravana is a happy soul, and he is
even relieved from the fear of Sugreeva as he departed on the Avenue of Sublimity... [--b,
c]
"By the ending of Jataayu and by the end of Dasharatha, also by the purloin of
Vaidehi, all of the monkeys are piled into a predicament... 
"Just by giving boons to Kaikeyi, the quandaries like Rama's dwelling in forests
along with Seetha and Lakshmana, as a result of Rama's fury eliminating complete demons of
Janasthaana, and as a result, Raghava's arrow exterminating Val, have come to pass." Thus Angada is
lamenting. 
On observing the monkeys who lay recumbent on the ground and on hearing them eulogising
the death of Jataayu the king of eagles Sampaati is highly perturbed by that uncomfortable
information about Jatayu, and that high-minded Sampaati sorrowfully spelled out this word.

That shredder-billed eagle Sampaati said this sentence voicing thunderously on
hearing words voiced by Angada. 
"Who speaks to announce as though to quake my heart that Jatayu, the more precious
brother of mine than my own lives, is slain? 
"How combat occasioned between that eagle and a demon in Janasthaana, and how am I
hearing this name of my brother after a long time... 
"I wish you to get me down from these mountain soars. After a long time, I have heard
about my younger brother who is straightforward, and praiseworthy for his valor, and I am glad that
too spoke of him praisefully... 
"Thereby, oh, best vanara-s, I wish to listen about the death of my brother Jataayu
when he was in Janasthaana... 
"Whose eldest and dear son is Rama, the creditable one for doyens, that Dasharatha
is the friend of my brother Jatayu/ But how did Dasharatha pass away? 
"I am incapable of spreading my wings widely as they are burnt by the Sun's rays, hence oh,
enemy-chasteners, I wish you to lower me down from this mountain..." Thus Sampaati sought the
help of monkeys. When those monkeys whose lives are almost purged spoke to Sampaati with such dreary
words, that thunder-voiced eagle tearfully spoke to those vanara-s. 
"Oh, vanara-s, of whom it is enounced that mighty Ravana felled him in combat,
that one is my younger brother named Jatayu... 
"Even though I hear that my brother is slain I have to resign myself from any
activity owing to my oldness and my winglessness, and presently I am indeed incapacitated to
retaliate my brother's enemy... 
"Once, when the elimination of demon Vritta was taking place at the hand of Indra,
we two eagle brothers sportively desiring to surpass each other flew sunward, and we have gone very
near to the scorch-rayed sun... 
"Covering the skyway we have gone to firmament much speedily, then bechanced is
noontide and thus bechanced is the scorching of the noontime sun, and then Jataayu started to
founder... 
"On seeing him who is being thwarted by scorching sunrays, then I started to cover
my highly fretful brother with both of my wings in all my brotherliness... 
"And oh, vanara-chiefs, when sunrays have utterly burned my wings I fell on
this Mt. Vindhya, and while living hereabouts constrainedly, I could pay no attention to my
brother's experiences or, at least his existence, or otherwise..." So lamented old Sampaati.

When Sampaati the brother of Jataayu spoke in that way, then the highly discerning
crown prince Angada replied to him. 
"If you are the brother of Jataayu, if you have heard whatever I have said in praise
of Jataayu, and if you are aware of the whereabouts of Ravana... please tell it... 
"If you are aware of the location of that bigoted and knavish demon Ravana, please
inform us. Doesn't matter whether that location is nearby or far off as we can search far and
wide..." Thus Angada asked Sampaati. 
Then Sampaati, the high-spirited elder brother of Jataayu, spoke these words that
are self-befitting and that would highly gladden the monkeys. 
"I am an eagle with utterly burnt wings and vanished valiance, even then, I wish to
render the best service in the task of Rama, at least verbally... 
"I have seen the netherworlds of Rain-god viz., earth and its substrata likeatala. vitala, sutala, paataalaterrains... and I have even seen those
empyrean worlds that were triply trodden by Vishnu, and the intermediary regions of upper and lower
worlds where gods and demons combated ghastlily, and because I am that aged I have also seen the
unseeable Milky Ocean when it was churned for ambrosia... 
"It is I who am to render service in this task of Rama firstly, then you vanara-s,
as the common enemy of Rama and Jataayu is my first enemy, but I am decrepit as oldness has marred
my vigor and vitality... 
"I have seen a youngish lady while she is being stolen away by the black-hearted
demon Ravana. She was richly in her mien, embellished with every befitting jewelry for a princess,
and that lady in fury was bewailing calling, 'Rama... Rama...' even calling 'Lakshmana...' and she
was throwing her ornaments down and her limbs were highly wriggly to set herself free from that
demon... 
"In the flank of that blackish demon, her best ochry silk sari was dazzling like
sunshine atop a blackish mountain, or like lighting athwart a blackish ocean... 
"Thus, I deem her to be Seetha by her excessive laudation of Rama, and let the
location of that demon be heard from me while I say about it... 
"He is the son of Vishravasa and brother of Kubera, and he presides over
the city is named Lanka and he is known as Ravana... 
"There is a lavish city in the oceanic island afar a hundred yojana-s all in all
from here, which Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect, has built, and it is called Lanka.

"Its multi-storied buildings are built very symmetrically and they will be in golden
tinge with completely golden doors. The golden podia of verandas are amazing. That city is securely
enclosed in a gigantic rampart that will be dazzling in the color of the sun... 
"Therein that Lanka pitiable Vaidehi wearing ochry silk sari is lodged in the
palace-chambers of Ravana highly sentineled and balked by demonesses, and you can find king
Janaka's daughter Maithili is in there... 
"Now, oh, fly-jumpers, first get to the other shore of the island in the southern ocean,
which ocean spans in an overalled width of hundred yojana-s from this side of the seashore, then
landing on the other seashore you can see Lanka secluded all around by ocean, and in such a
water-walled Lanka you can see Ravana... hence, hurry up, and promptly triumph over Lanka...

"I foresee by my prognosis that your sighting Seetha is definite at that place, and
definite is your return from there. The first flight level of birds is that of the small Kulinga
birds, house sparrows, songbirds, and the like subsisting on food grains. The second flight level is
that of the birds that are the eaters of leftovers like crows and doves or the eaters of
tree fruits like parrots. The third flight level is that of the wading birds like Bhaasa, Kraunca,
Kurara birds and cranes, herons, and the like. The fourth flight level is that of hawks and the
fifth is that of the vultures. 
"And the sixth flight level is that of the swans which derive their valor, vigor,
handsomeness, and youthfulness by their majestic birth. But the uppermost path is that of the sons
of Lady Vinata, namely the Divine Eagle Garuda, and Anuuru, the non-stopping charioteer of Sun.
Because we eagles have our lineal descent from the Divine Eagle, we can soar to the uppermost
flyable path and see keenly... 
"By which raw-flesh-eating demon this deplorable deed of abducting Seetha is done,
if that demon is retaliated by Rama and you all, my vendetta towards the very same demon, caused by
his animosity towards my brother Jataayu will also be fulfilled... 
"Staying here I am seeing Ravana and like that Janaki... even for us eagles,
our sight and power will be excellent like that of Garuda, the Divine Eagle... 
"Thereby, oh, vanara-s, dietetically and congenitally we eagles can always see till
the end of hundred yojana-s, comprehensively... 
"The leg-fighters, namely cocks, are destined to have their livelihood just at the
base of their feet, but our livelihood is to be obtained from the farthest... alas... 
"Let some idea be searched to leap the salty ocean. For sure, you will return to
Kishkindha on your finding Vaidehi, and on your becoming productive of your objective...

"I wish you would shift me to the residence of Rain-god, namely the ocean, for
ablating water in respect of my great-souled brother Jataayu who departed to heaven..." Thus
Sampaati spoke to the monkeys. 
Then those vanara-s of utmost dynamism on taking wing-burnt-bird Sampaati to the
husband rivulets and rivers, namely the ocean, placed him on the shoreline. Again, the vanara-s
sincerely brought back that king of birds, Sampaati, after his offering oblations to Jataayu, and
lodged him as a returnee at his place. On deriving an indication form Sampaati regarding Seetha,
Ravana and Lanka, those returnless vanara-s returned to their search while their gladness returned
to them. "Then the monkey commanders sat on that beautiful mountain surrounding the eagle from
all over, after that eagle offered water-oblations for his deceased Jataayu and bathed for
purification. 
Sampaati who earned the trustworthiness of monkeys, and who is sitting surrounded by all
monkeys, again gladly spoke to Angada who sat at his close by. 
"Oh, monkeys, you all be quiet and listen to my words alertly as I wish to recount
the actuality as to how I came to know about Maithili... 
"Oh, impeccable Angada, once I have fallen on the peak of this Mt. Vindhya when
sunrays completely burned my wings and limbs scorching in the sun's heat... 
"On getting sensitivity after six days, and on looking in all directions I could not
recognize anything in the least, as I was helpless and frantic... 
"But then on observing all the oceans, mountains, rivers, lakes, provinces and
forests, I could regain senses... 
"Since this mountain is teeming with teams of birds, caves in its midriffs, and it
is with peaks of its kind, thus I resolved this to be Mt. Vindhya at the coast of southern
Ocean... 
"There was a sacred hermitage belonging to a sage of intense ascesis known as Sage
Nishaakara which was reverenced even by gods. 
"Eight thousand years have lapsed while I was living here on this mountain after the
the departure of that probity-knowing sage Nishakara to heaven. 
'I again reached the earth descending from the lopsided peak of Mt. Vindhya,
onerously and slowly, whereat the sacred-grass-blades are thorny... 
"As I was desiring to see that sage I neared that place with much anguish because I
and Jataayu approached that sage for many a time in earlier times... 
"Near about his hermitage wind waffles with a sweet smell, and no tree is flowerless
and no tree is fruitless, whatsoever it is... 
"On nearing that sacred hermitage and sheltering myself at the base of a tree, I
waited there desirous to see that godly Nishaakara... 
"Then I saw the sage available distantly, returning facing north after performing
his holy bath, an unassailable sage irradiating the ambiance with his radiance... 
"Bears, antelopes, tigers, lions, and diverse reptiles and snakes are following him
at his heel, as with living beings following a donor, or all-donating Brahma... 
"As to how the ministerial and military staff retrace steps when a king enters his
place-chambers, so also the animals and other beings on knowing the sage's entry into his
hermitage retraced their steps and went away... 
"But the sage is gladdened on seeing me and though he has entered into his hermitage
he again came out in a moment and asked about the objective of my visit... 
" 'On seeing the deformity of your feathers, oh, gentle Sampaati, you
unidentifiable. These two wings of yours are fire burnt, but lives are let out in your body...'
Thus, the sage started to talk to me... 
" 'I have earlier seen you two eagle brothers, kingly eagles among eagles, similar
in your speed to Wind-god and form-changers by your wish... 
" 'You are the elder, isn't it? And Jataayu is your younger brother. You used to
touch my feet taking up human forms... 
"Is this falling of wings a result of any illness, if so what is it... or is this
any scourge imposed on you, if so, who is he... tell me all who am inquiring into those details...
"Then the monkey commanders sat on that beautiful mountain surrounding the eagle from
all over, after that eagle has offered water oblations for his deceased Jataayu and bathed for
purification. 
Sampaati who earned the trustworthiness of monkeys, and who is sitting surrounded by all
monkeys, again gladly spoke to Angada who sat at his close by.

"Then I have informed the Sage Nishaakara all about that impossible and
impracticable deed is done indiscreetly by me and Jataayu and our following the Sun in red heat, as
well..." Thus Sampaati continued his legend. 
"Oh, godly sage, the scorching sun has ulcerated me, shame perturbed my senses for not
protecting Jatayu, further, I am haggard to descend this mountain to come to you, such I am I am
incapable of speaking, elaborately... 
"Fascinated by our arrogance and inquisitive of our relative triumphs, myself and
Jataayu competitively flew up far away in the sky... 
"Before the sages on the peak of Mt. Kailash, we have staked a stake that we two
shall follow the Sun till he reaches the great westerly mountain, namely Mt. Dusk... 
"We reached the sky in a trice to a height wherefrom we could see each of the
townships on the surface of the earth, separately and singly, in the size of a chariot's wheel...

"We have seen and heard instrumental music somewhere, and somewhere else tinkling of
jewelry, and elsewhere singing of many ladies dressed in red... 
"On our quick rising to the sky and abiding in the solar path we have observed that a
Forest is positioned just as a patch of pasture on earth... 
"From there the earth covered with pebble-like mountain heights appeared shingly,
and interwoven with yarn like rivers the surface of the earth is thready... 
"Himalayas, even Mt. Vindhya, and even the very high mountain Mt. Meru shone forth
like elephants in lakes... 
"Then there bechanced an abnormal sweating, tiredness and fear, and then stupor
invading both of us, we two underwent severe vertigo... 
"We are not in the know of southern direction which belongs to Yama, the Terminator,
nor of south-east which belongs to Fire-god, also not of west which belongs to Rain-god... and the
the world appeared as though burnt down by the fire at the end of an era and destructed of its routine...

"Though my brainpower is deranged I again tried laboriously just depending on my
sight. I again tried strenuously concentrating my brainpower and sight on the Sun and I have directly
seen the Sun. Then the Sun appeared in a size equal to the earth. 
"Without informing me Jataayu started to trip over the earth, and then on seeing him
I too let myself loose from the sky... 
"I have hidden Jataayu in the sky with both my wings from the scorching Sun... hence, he
It does not burn that much... but I am completely burnt when falling from the sky... 
"I supposed that Jataayu as has fallen in Janasthaana, but I have fallen on Mt.
Vindhya, as a wing-burnt and insensate eagle... 
"As one who is divested of his kingdom, his brother, both of his wings and his own
valance too, such as I was I wished to fall from the mountaintop to die, in any way...
That righteous Rama readying his great bow decorated with gold, and on taking blazing sun-similar arrows 
that are victory-oriented in wars, proceeded from Rishyamuka along with Sugreeva to the city ruled by 
the valor of Vali, namely Kishkindha. 
Stern-necked Sugreeva and the great mighty Lakshmana strode ahead of that great soul Rama.
The brave Hanuma, dauntless Nala and Neela, and the captain of monkeys Tara of great energy 
followed them rearward. 
They moved on looking at the trees that were drooping with the weight of their flowers, and at the rivers 
that were carrying pleasant water while they were coursing toward the ocean. 
They see house-like caverns, crags, ravines and caves, and monumental peaks, and cavities that are 
pleasant for sight has moved on. 
On their way, they observed lakes that were glistening forth with gem-like waters without slime and with 
lotus buds in the budding stage. Those lakes are reverberant with Karandava-s, Saarasa-s, Swans, Vanjula-s, and other waterfowls, also 
like that with Chakravaaka-s and other birds. 
They have seen fearless deer feeding on soft grass blades everywhere, somewhere moving here and there 
in the forest, and elsewhere standing. 
They have also seen the forest elephants that have white tusks for their ornaments and that are moving 
in herds, which are the dangerous enemies of lakes as they destroy lakebeds. 
Also seen are the vigorous and elephantine monkeys that are like mobile mountains, begrimed with dust, 
and bellowing on mountain ridges. 
On seeing other forest beings in that forest and birds moving aloft in the sky, those followers of Sugreeva 
quickly moved on.
While they are quickly going, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, sees a clump of forest trees 
and he asks Sugreeva this. 
"This cluster of trees surrounded by plantain trees is like an accumulation of thick clouds, and this 
is shining forth like a cloudscape in the sky. 
"What is this? I wish to know and oh, friend, I wish you to clear this inquisitiveness of mine.
On hearing that sentence of that great soul Raghava, then Sugreeva described the significance 
of that forest while proceeding on the way. 
"Raghava, this spacious hermitage with abundant gardens and dainty tubers, fruits, and water is a weary 
remover." Thus Sugreeva started telling Rama. 
"There were hermits named Jana, Seven Persons, who were dourly vowed 
with their heads pendulous downward and legs up, as inshiirSa aasana, 
the upside-down yogic body posture, and who always reclined in water.
"They were making diet on air alone that too once in seven days, and living unwaveringly in that way 
they practiced their asceticism for seven hundred years and went to the heavens with their bodies. 
"This hermitage that has encircling trees for its compound wall has become highly unassailable even 
for Indra together with all gods and demons.
"Birds and other forest moving animals forbear this hermitage and those that unknowingly enter in there 
do not return. 
"From there artistically worded lyrical and instrumental tunes and even the sounds of ornaments are 
audible, and oh, Raghava, one can sense a divine fragrance too. 
"Even the triadic ritual fires glow there, and their thick and ochry-colored smoke is like that of a reddish-brown 
pigeon is muffling the treetops. 
"When that smoke is mantling their tops these trees are beaming forth like mountains of gems overlaid 
with clusters of clouds.
"Offer salutations determinedly and adjoining palms addressing the sages called Seven Persons, oh Raghava, 
along with Brother Lakshmana
"Those that offer salutations to those sages with contemplated souls will evince no bodily trauma in 
the least." Thus said Sugreeva to Rama. 
Then Rama along with brother Lakshmana adjoined palms, addressed himself to the great-souled sages known 
as Seven Persons, and offered salutations to them. 
That righteous Rama along with brother Lakshmana, Sugreeva, and other monkeys having worshipped those 
sages proceeded to Kishkindha well-pleased at heart. 
Having gone a long way from that hermitage of Seven Persons they have seen that unassailable and Vali-ruledcity namely Kishkindha. [4-13-29]
Then Rama bothers Lakshmana, Rama, and other monkeys wielding their weapons and flaring with their 
upsurged fiery again came to eliminate that enemy Vali to the city that is ruled by the brawn of the 
same Vali, the son of Indra. Seetha, who was overwhelmed with anguish on hearing Ravana's words, was comforted
and rendered happy by Sarama, as parched earth is solaced by rain.
Desiring to be of further service to her friend Seetha, the affectionate Sarama,
skilled in the knowledge of time, smiling while talking, spoke the following words at that
appropriate time.
"O, black eyed lady! I am capable of carrying a message of your words and good will
to Rama and to return secretly."
"When I am journeying in the sky self -supported, neither the god of wind nor Garuda
the eagle can follow my movement."
To Sarama, who was speaking as aforesaid, Seetha her voice no longer charged with
grief, gently and sweetly replied in the following words:
"You are capable of going to heaven or to the penultimate subterranean region. Know
from me today the duty that has got to be performed by you for my sake."
"If your intention is to act kindly towards me and your resolve is firm , I wish you
to go and know what Ravana is doing now."
"That cruel and evil minded Ravana, equipped with strength in the shape of conjuring
tricks, who makes his enemies cry has bemused me, as spirituous liquor bemuses one, the moment it
is imbibed."
"He causes me to be threatened by words all the time by the most frightful ogresses,
who always surround me and insult me by their act repeatedly."
"I am depressed in mind and distrustful. My mind is not in its natural state.
Staying in Ashoka grove, I am distressed because of his fear."
"Report to me, all that is decided by him during his talk going on with his
ministers about the matter of releasing me or keeping me captive. It will be of great service to
me."
The soft spoken Sarama, wiping her face, which got moist with tears, replied as
follows to Seetha who was speaking as aforesaid:
"If your opinion is like this, I shall go on that account, O, Seetha! Having grasped
the feeling of the enemies, I shall return O, Seetha!"
Speaking thus, Surama thereafter went to the vicinity of that demon and heard the
conversation of Ravana who was with his ministers.
Sarama, who knew how to investigate could hear the wicked Ravana's resolve and soon
returned to Ashoka grove.
Sarama, who entered the Ashoka grove, saw Seetha who looked like Lakshmi the goddess
of prosperity (and the wife of Vishnu); bereft of the lotus and waiting for her only.
Seetha affectionately embraced the kindly speaking Surama who returned there and
offered personally a seat to her.
"Sitting here comfortably, tell me about the real design of that cruel and wicked
Ravana"
When Seetha trembling with fear enquired thus, Sarama narrated all the conversation
of Ravana together with his ministers.
"Excellent words were spoken by Kaikasi, the mother of Ravana as well as Aviddha the
aged minister asking for your release, O Seetha!"
"Let Seetha, be restored honorably to Rama the Lord of men. That wonderful** thing
happened in Janasthana is an enough eye- opener to you."
"Which mortal would accomplish the crossing of the ocean, the discovery of Seetha by
Hanuman, and the carnage of the demons in combat on this earth?"
"Though admonished in many ways by the aged ministers and his mother he is not
inclined to set you free, any more than a miser would leave his hold on his riches.
"O, Seetha! He does not want to release you, without dying himself in a battle. This
is the resolve of the cruel Ravana along with his ministers."
-"Thereafter, due to infatuation caused by his impending death, his aforesaid
determination is very firm .He is not in a position to release you, not through sheer fear, but
until he is actually defeated in battle through the carnage of all the demons and of himself."
"O, dark eyed Seetha! Killing Ravana by his sharp arrows in combat, Rama will take
you back to Ayodhya by all means."
In the meantime was heard the sound of all the monkey troops blended with the sound
of kettle drums, causing earth to shake.
Hearing that sound of that monkey troops, the servants of Ravana stationed in Lanka
were lack- luster with their movements, overcome by depression. They did not see anything salutary
in it, owing to the fault of their king.Seeing the bewildered Seetha, a demon named Sarama*, an affectionate female
companion then approached Seetha, her beloved Seetha, her beloved friend.
Sarama, the soft-spoken woman, consoled Seetha who having been infatuated by Ravana
was very much in distress.
Sarma, who was assigned by Ravana to guard Seetha, was kind hearted and firm in
austerity. She was indeed made a companion by Seetha, who was being protected by her there.
The affectionate Sarama found Seetha stupefied and just risen after rolling in the
dust and soiled, resembling a female horse.
Sarama consoled the very virtuous Seetha as follows "O, Seetha! Be comfortable! Do
not get perturbed in your mind.
timid woman! Because of my friendship with you, I overheard Ravana's words and all
the words you have spoken in reply to him, by hiding nearby in a barren sky without fear. O, large
eyed woman! I do not have any fear of Ravana, owing to my affection towards you".
"O, Seetha! Every thing was ascertained by me on the spot, after going out, about
the reason for which Ravana has gone away agitated."
"It is not possible to attack Rama, a man of self awareness, while he is asleep. Nay
even killing him, the tiger among men, is well nigh impossible."
"It is not possible to kill in this manner even monkeys, who perform fighting with
trees, in as much as they are fully protected by Rama, even as celestials are protected by Indra
their lord"
"O, Seetha! Rama, who is endowed with long and well rounded arms, an illustrious
man, who is large-chested, a man of great energy, an archer well known in the world, a man endowed
with muscularity, a righteous minded man, a person of celebrity on earth, a man of eternal
strength, a protector for himself and for others, while together with his brother Lakshmana, a man
of high descent, a knower of doctrines of conduct and behavior, the killer of a stream of enemy
forces, a man of inconceivable strength and valor, a venerable man and an annihilator of
adversaries, has not been killed."
"A trickery has been hurled on you here by the cruel Ravana, a conjurer, who is
perverse in thinking and action and an enemy of all beings."
"Your sorrow is (now) gone once for all. An all-pervading auspiciousness will await
you. Accordingly prosperity will attend on you. Hear me."
"Rama, along with his army of monkeys, having crossed the ocean, reached its
southern shore and is encamped there."
"Rama, who was along with fully meaningful Lakshmana, was perceived by me. He stands
protected by the troops gathered together at the vicinity of the ocean."
"Some swift paced demons, who were dispatched by Ravana, brought this very news here
that Rama has crossed the ocean."
"O, the wide-eyed Seetha! Hearing that news, yonder Ravana is busy making
deliberations with all his ministers."
While Sarama, the ogre was talking as aforesaid with Seetha; a terrific sound was
heard, from the troops engaged in the impending war.
Hearing the crashing sound of kettle drums, made to sound like a thunder storm with
a drum stick, Sarama in her sweet voice spoke to Seetha as follows:
"O, timid Seetha! This frightful sound of a kettledrum is indeed indicative of
preparation for a war. Hear also the thundering crash of the kettle drums, which resembles the
rumbling of clouds"
"Elephants in rut are being caparisoned for war. Chariot horses are being prepared
for a battle. Thousands of horsemen carrying darts in their hands are seen."
"Thousands of soldiers equipped with armor are marching quickly hither and thither.
Royal highways are filled with wonderfully looking warriors like a swift flowing sea with its flood
of waters making a roaring sound."
"See hurriedly, this sheen of polished weapons, shields and coats of mail sending
forth luster of many hues like the splendor of fire consuming a forest in summer. Here is seen the
flurry of chariots, horses and elephants following the lead of Ravana as well as of energetic
demons thrilled with joy."
"Hear the sound of bells of elephants. Hear the ratting of chariots. Hear the cry of
neighing horses, resembling the flourish of trumpets. Here is the bustle of demons, carrying
uplifted weapons in their hands; following the lead of Ravana. This bustling activity is causing
hair to stand erect through terror."
"A good fortune, which will bring your sorrow to an end, awaits you. A peril has
arrived for demons. The lotus eyed Rama, your husband, who has overcome his anger but having an
unimaginable strength will kill Ravana in battle and win you back"
"Your consort along with Lakshmana will show his valor against the demons, like
Indra the lord of celestials along with Vishnu the lord of preservation, the annihilator of enemies
exhibited his strength over his adversaries."
"Very soon, I shall see you, mounted on the lap of Rama who actually arrived, your
object of his coming being fulfilled and the enemy fallen."
"O, Seetha! You will shed tears of joy on the bosom of that broad-chested Rama, re-
united with you and holding you clasped to his breast."
"Before long, O divine Seetha, that mighty Rama will loosen the one single plait
which has reached past your hips, which you have worn these many months."
"O, Queen! Seeing his face, looking like a rising moon, you will renounce your tears
born of grief, like a female snake casts off its slough."
"O, Seetha! Having killed Ravana in combat within no time, Rama (who deserves
facility); will enjoy happiness in the company of the beloved, namely yourself."
Acclaimed by the high soled Rama, you will be so happy as how the earth, endowed
with crops, feels after the onset of good rains."
"O, queen! Seek refuge now with him - the sun that rolls towards Meru the highest
mountain, like a horse that makes its round rapidly. That sun is indeed the source of all
creatures."Then, Rama spoke these harsh words to the ocean: "O, ocean! I will make you dry up
now along with your nethermost subterranean region."
"O, Ocean! A vast stretch of sand will appear, when your water gets consumed by my
arrows; when you get dried up and the creatures inhabiting you get destroyed by me."
"By a gush of arrows released by my bow, our monkeys can proceed to the other shore
even by foot; O, ocean!"
"O, Sea the abode of demons! You are not able to recognize my valor or prowess
through your intelligence .You will indeed get repentance at my hands."
"Fixing an arrow resembling the Rod of Brahma (the creator) charged with a missile
(presided over by Brahama) to his excellent bow, the exceedingly powerful Rama stretched it towards
the sea."
While Rama was stretching that bow, both the heaven and earth suddenly seemed to be
split asunder. Mountains also were shaken.
Darkness enveloped the world. All the quarters were obscured. Lakes and rivers were
soon agitated.
The moon sun and the stars moved obliquely and though the sun's rays lighted the
sky, it was enveloped by darkness and shined with a blaze of hundreds of meteors while thunders
reverberated with an unparalleled sound in the sky.
Series of celestial winds blew in their colossal form and the winds, then sweeping
away the clouds, tore up the trees again and again.
The wind, shattering the mountain peaks, broke off the points of the rocks. Winds of
great velocity struck together in the sky and emitted flashes of radiance proceeding from lightning
with a great sound and then there were great thunders.
The visible creatures cried out along with the thunders. The invisible beings too
gave off a terrific noise. The creatures were overpowered, frightened, agitated, lied down and also
very much anguished. They did not move due to fear.
The great ocean with its waves and water, along with its living creatures including
snakes and demons soon became possessed of a terrific velocity. Due to that speed and swelling of
waters, the ocean crossed beyond the other shore to the extent of a Yojana (eight miles).
Rama born in Raghu dynasty and the annihilator of enemies, did not retreat before
that ocean, which swelled and crossed its limits.
Then, Sagara (the ocean god) himself rose from the middle of the ocean as the sun
rises at dawn from the huge mountain of Meru.
That ocean along with snakes of flaming jaws appeared with a hue of glossy emerald
adorned with gold.
The valiant ocean, the lord of rivers, wearing a wreath of pearls, with his eyes
resembling lotus leaves, bearing a beautiful garland made of all kinds of flowers on his head, with
ornaments of refined gold, adorned with excellent jewels made of pearls from his domain, decorated
with different kinds of gems and metals, resembling Himavat mountain, wearing on his broad chest a
locket shedding a white luster, resembling a Kaustubha gem (adorning the blossom of Lord Vishnu)
and hanging in the middle of a single string of pearls, with a multitude of waves whirled around
him, encircled by the clouds and winds, escorted by rivers mainly the Ganga and Sindhu, endowed
with diverse forms resembling various deities, approached Rama with joined palms, who stood with
arrows in hand, addressing him first as  Rama!' and spoke the following words:
"O, beloved Rama! Earth, wind ether, water and light remain fixed in their own
nature, resorting to their eternal path."
"Therefore, I am fathomless and my nature is that it is impossible of being swum
across. It becomes unnatural if I am shallow. I am telling you the following device to cross
me."
"O, prince! Neither from desire nor ambition nor fear nor from affection, I am able
to solidify my waters inhabited by alligators."
"O, Rama! I shall make it possible to see that you are able to cross over. I will
arrange a place for the monkeys to cross me and bear with it. As far as the army crosses me, the
crocodiles will not be aggressive to them."
Then, Rama spoke to that ocean as follows: "Listen to me. This great arrow should
not go in vain. In which region should it be descended?"
Hearing Rama's words and seeing that powerful arrow, the large splendid Ocean spoke
the following words to Rama:
"Towards my northern side, there is a holy place. It is well known as Drumatulya, in
the same way as you are well known to this world."
"Numerous robbers of fearful aspect and deeds, having the sinful Abhiras as their
chief, drink my waters there."
"I am not able to bear that touch of those wicked people, the evil doers, O, Rama!
Let this excellent arrow with out vain be released over them there."
Hearing those words of the high-soled Ocean, Rama released that excellent and
splendid arrow towards that place as directed by the ocean.
The place where the arrow, whose splendor was akin to that of a thunder and a
thunder bolt, was descended by Rama- that place is indeed famous as desert of Maru* on this
earth.
The earth there, pierced by the dart, then emitted a sound . The waters of the
penultimate subterranean region gushed forth from the mouth of that cleft.
Then the hollow became known as Vrana. Water constantly seen, gushing forth from it
resembled seawater.
A terrific splitting sound was born in that place. Water was dried up in those
cavities, as a result of hurling of that arrow by Rama.
That desert of Maru became famous in the three worlds. Rama (the son of Dasaratha),
a wise man and a valiant man resembling a celestial, made that cavity dried up and gave a boon to
that desert of Maru.
Due to granting of a boon by Rama, that desert of Maru became the most congenial
place for cattle rearing, a place with a little of disease, producing tasty fruits and roots, with
a lot of clarified butter, a lot of milk and various kinds of sweet- smelling herbs. Thus it became
an auspicious and suitable move, bestowing these merits.
While that cavity was burning, Ocean the lord of rivers spoke these words to Rama
who knew all scientific treatises.
"O, excellent man! This one, named Nala, a glorious person, is the son of
Vishvakarma; who was given a boon by his father and is equal to Visvakarma."
"Let this greatly energetic monkey build a bridge across me. I can hold that bridge.
He is just the same as his father."
Thus speaking, the god of Ocean disappeared from that place. Then Nala, the more
distinguished among monkeys stood up and spoke the following words to Rama of great power:
"The great Ocean disclosed a truth. I will construct a bridge across this large
Ocean, taking recourse to the skill and ability of my father."
"This Sagara, the formidable mass of water, in fear of punishment, gave a passage to
Rama, wishing to see a bridge constructed on it."
"On the mountain of Mandara, the following boon was given by Visvakarma to my
mother: "O, god like lady! A son equal to me will be born to you."
"I am a son born of Visvakarma's own loins. I am equal to Visvakarma. This god of
Ocean has reminded me. The great ocean spoke the truth. Being unasked, I have not told you my
details earlier."
"I am capable of constructing a bridge across the ocean. Hence, let the foremost of
monkeys build the bridge now itself."
Then, being sent by Rama, hundreds and thousands of monkey heroes jumped in joy on
all sides towards the great forest.
Those army-chiefs of monkeys, who resembled mountains, broke the rocks and trees
there and dragged them away towards the sea.
Those monkeys filled the ocean with all types of trees like Sala and Asvakarna,
Dhava and bamboo, Kutaja, Arjuna, palmyra,Tilaka, Tinisa, Bilva, Saptaparna, Karnika, in blossom as
also mango and Asoka.
The excellent monkeys, the forest animals lifted and brought, like Indra's flag
posts, some trees with roots intact and some others without roots.
From here and there the monkeys brought Palmyra trees, pomegranate shrubs, coconut
and Vibhitaka, Karira, Bakula and neem trees.
The huge bodied monkeys with mighty strength uprooted elephant-sized rocks and
mountains and transported them by mechanical contrivances.
The water, raised up due to sudden throwing of mountains in the sea, soured upward
towards the sky and from there again, gushed back.
The rocks befalling on all sides perturbed the ocean. Some others drew up strings a
hundred Yojanas long (in order to keep the rocks in a straight line.)
Nala on his part initiated a monumental bridge in the middle of the ocean. The
bridge was built at that time with the cooperation of other monkeys, of terrible doings.
Some monkeys were holding poles for measuring the bridge and some others collected
the material. Reeds and logs resembling clouds and mountains, brought by hundreds of monkeys, lead
by the command of Rama, fastened some parts of the bridge.
Monkeys constructed the bridge with trees having blossom at the end of their boughs.
Some monkeys looking like demons seized rocks resembling mountains and peaks of mountains and
appeared running hither and thither.
Then, a tumultuous sound occurred when the rocks were thrown into the sea and when
mountains were caused to fall there.
On the first day, fourteen Yojanas of bridge were constructed by the monkeys
speedily, thrilled with delight as they were, resembling elephants.
In the same manner, on the second day twenty Yojanas of bridge were constructed
speedily by the monkeys of terrific bodies and of mighty strength.
Thus, on the third day twenty-one Yojanas of the bridge were constructed in the
ocean speedily by the monkeys with their colossal bodies.
On the forth day, a further of twenty-two Yojanas were constructed by the dashing
monkeys with a great speed.
In that manner, on the fifth day, the monkeys working quickly constructed
twenty-three yojanas of the bridge up to the other seashore.
That Nala, the strong and illustrious son of Visvakarma and an excellent monkey
built the bridge across the sea as truly as his father would have built it.
That beautiful and lovely bridge constructed by Nala across the ocean the abode of
alligators, shone brightly like a milky way of stars in the sky.
With a desire to behold that marvel, celestials along with Gandharvas, the heavenly
musicians, Siddhas (semi-divine beings of great purity and perfection, possessing super natural
qualities) and great sages came then and stood up in the sky.
The celestials and Gandharvas, the heavenly musicians saw Nala's bridge, having a
width of ten yojanas and a length of hundred yojanas and which was very difficult to be built.
The monkeys taking long leaps and short leaps shouted in joy. All other beings saw
that construction of the bridge across the ocean as unimaginable, impossible and wonderful, causing
their hair to stand on end in amazement.
Those thousand crores of monkeys in a great spectacle reached the other shore of the
great ocean soon after building that bridge across the sea.
That colossal bridge, which was broad, well-constructed, glorious, well postured and
held together firmly, looked beautiful like a separating straight line in the ocean.
Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his hand, stood up on the seashore along with his
ministers, for the purpose of invading the enemies.
Thereafter, Sugriva on his part spoke to Rama, the truly brave man as follows: "O,
valiant man! This ocean, the abode of alligators, is indeed vast. You ascend the shoulder of
Hanuman and let Lakshmana ascend the shoulder of Angada. These monkeys can hold both of you while
flying in the sky."
Rama the glorious and righteous man, wielding a bow along with Lakshmana together
with Sugriva, went in front of that army.
Some monkeys went along the middle of the bridge. Some others went along the sides.
Some others were jumping into water. Some others marched forward on the path. Some monkeys entered
the sky and aviated like Garuda the eagle.
The highly terrific sound of the ocean was covered up by the great sounds of the
terrific monkeys who were crossing the sea.
That army of monkeys, which crossed the ocean by the bridge constructed by Nala, was
encamped by Sugriva at a shore having many fruits tubers and water.
Seeing that Rama's accomplishment, which was amazing and arduous; celestials,
Siddhas (semi-divine beings possessing supernatural faculties) and Charanas (celestial bards) along
with great sages, forthwith approached Rama and consecrated him with very splendid waters
separately.
The celestials, Siddhas and others exalted Rama, who was duly respected by kings
with their auspicious -words as follows: " O, king! Defeat the enemies. Rule the earth and ocean
eternally for years."As commanded by the king of monkeys Sugreeva all of the elephantine monkeys essayed
everywhere with post-hast for a glimpse of Vaidehi. 
Those monkeys have thoroughly searched at lakes, in the pens of creepers on
riverbanks, vacant lands crowded cities, and impassable places with rivers and
mountains. 
All the monkey commanders explicitly commanded by Sugreeva, very carefully searched all the provinces inclusive of mountains,
woodlands, and thick forests of those provinces. 
All the Vanara-s firmed up in finding Seetha have searched nooks and corners of
earth by day, and at nighttimes they used to come together onto earth at scheduled places.

In all those days those Vanara-s used to come to trees which have fruits of all
seasons, to make those trees as their beds at bedtime. 
Counting the day of their starting as day one, those elephantine monkeys returned to
Mt. Prasavana within one month, hopeless of Seetha, and met Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, who is
with Rama awaiting the return of the monkeys. 
Cmdr. Vinata, the great-mighty vanara, came back after searching the eastern quarter as
Sugreeva had advised, but without finding Seetha there. 
Even the valiant and matchless monkey Shatabali explored the whole of the northern
direction along with his army, but he too came back as Seetha was undiscovered there. 
Sushena, the father-in-law of Sugreeva, searched the whole of the western quarter along
with vanara-s, but not finding Seetha there, he came back when one month was completed, and
approached Sugreeva. 
All of the expeditionists have reached and venerated Sugreeva who is sitting alone
with Rama on the peak of Mt. Prasavana and spoke this to him. 
"All of the mountains, all of the serried forests, all of the riversides up to the
edge of oceans, likewise, all of the inhabitants have been searched. 
"Those caves that were explicitly extolled by you, they are all thoroughly searched,
and immense shrubby hutches that are thickly entwined with climber plants have also been rummaged.

"Search is conducted in the compacted, lopsided, and impenetrable provinces, and
colossal beings are hunted out and killed presuming that Ravana might have assumed those odd
shapes and the impassable provinces are searched high and low, time and again. 
"Hanuma is high-born and exceptionally mighty, oh, Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s,
he will ascertain about Maithili, because the son of Air-god, Hanuma, resorted to the direction in
which Seetha is taken away." Thus, monkey chiefs reported to their king Sugreeva. Associated with Angada, Lt. Tara, and others, the monkey Hanuma searched the caves
and thick forests of the Vindhya Range. 
Hanuma has searched in the caves of that kingly Mt. Vindhya, which are jammed in
with lions and tigers, and even at the towering rapids. 
They reached the southwest peak of that mountain during their search and the time
set by Sugreeva swiftly lapsed while they were overstaying thereat that Mt. Vindhya alone.
Though that extensive province is indeed an unsearchable one with its impenetrable
caves and forests, Hanuma, the son of Air-god, searched everywhere on that mountain. [--b,
]
Without pressing one another closely, yet not distancing from one another largely,
Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, also thus Mainda, Dvivida, and Hanuma, and even
Jaambavanta, crown prince Angada, also the forest mover Lt. Tara have searched that province in
the southern direction that is encompassed by interlocked mountains, and during their search there
they have observed a wide-opened and impassable cavity known as the Riksha cavity which is well guarded
by a demon called Maya. 
Thirst and hunger invading them they are fatigued and craving for water, and such as
they are they beheld that capacious cavity which is enwrapped in climbers and trees. [--,
a]
There they saw swans and waterfowls like Kraunca, Saarasa, and even
Cakravaka waterfowls exiting from the cavity with their bodies drenched in water and reddened with
the dapples of lotuses' pollen. 
When those best vanara-s have neared that fragrant and impermeable cavity they are
disheartened with amazement. 
Though a suspicion, in general, is evoked in them, as they presumed that cavity to be
Naraka, The Hell of Yama, or Paataala, the Netherworld of Emperor Bali, those highly resplendent
and great mighty fly-jumpers have neared it, rejoicing for the availability of water in there.

That hideous cavity is dispersed with diverse beings, similar to the residence of
the emperor of demons, namely Emperor Bali, in Paataala, the Netherworld, and it is unsightly and
impermeable from anywhere. 
The son of Air-god Hanuma whose glossiness is like that of a mountaintop and who is
a mastermind in scrutinizing every inscrutable forest, then spoke to all of the formidable
Vanara-s. 
"We all have searched the southern quarter including those places that are enmeshed
with meshes of mountains, and we are overly fatigued, but Maithili is unnoticed. [--b,
a]
"Swans along with waterfowls like Saarasa, Kruanca, and water-drenched Cakravaka
birds are coming out of this cavity from all over, and even the trees available at its doorway are
verdant. Certainly, there must be a wellspring, or otherwise a pond with water." Thus Hanuma spoke
to all monkeys. 
When Hanuma spoke to them thus as a kind of assurance, all those monkeys entered the
cavity and found it as a sunless or moonless cavity, enfolded in hair-raising darkness. [--b,
a]
Those tigers and monkeys have also seen lions and various other animals and birds
exiting therefrom, and entered that cavity which is enshrouded in obscurity. 
Their eyesight, or their vigor, or their valorousness is rendered ineffectual, and
their permeation is just like the directionless air as their eyesight is thwarted in
gloominess.
Despite the gloominess of that cavity, unobstructed is their eyesight, or their
vigor or their valorousness, and their permeation is like that of the gust of air as their
eyesight is actuated even in darkness. 
But on their going further into that cavity speedily, those elephantine monkeys
beheld the best place that is luminous, as well as lovely. 
In that awful cave that is compacted with various trees, then they advanced further
an interstice of yojana distance, hand in hand lest one may miss the other. 
Though they are craving for water, highly perplexed, and lost track of their
destination or any waterway, and yet hopeful of their mission they unwearyingly hopped into that
cavity for a good while. 
Those fly-jumpers are presently enervated overly tired, and sad-faced, and when
those brave ones despair of their life, just then they perceive a luminescence. [--b,
a]
Those amenable monkeys on arriving at that province then beheld a shadowless
woodland with golden trees which in irradiance is like the irradiated ritual fire. They beheld
Saala, Taala  Tamaala trees and some flowered trees like Punnaaga, Vanjula, Dhava,
Campaka, Naaga, also Karnikaara trees. The bunches of their flowers are golden and amazing,
the leaflets are reddish, and like that the climbers enwreathing at their tops are like their towering
diadems and since those trees have golden fruits, they look as though decorated with golden
jewelry. Those golden-bodied tresses shine forth like the tender sun and their pedestals are
completely studded with lapis gems. The birds encircling those trees are in the hue of lapis lazuli
gems. The lotus lakes are encompassed with golden lotuses with broad petals, which in shine are
similar to the tender sun. 
Then they beheld there the lotus lakes containing serene waters and stocky lotuses
and burly fishes that are golden. 
There the monkeys beheld choicest mansions everywhere made out of gold and silver,
some with golden and some with silver domes, while some with golden and some with silver
multi-stories, but all are studded with lapis gems with golden windows covered with laceworks of
pearls. 
They have also seen everywhere flowered and fruited trees that are similar in shine
to red corals and rubies, and golden honeybees, as well as honeys. 
They beheld everywhere diverse and capacious beds and seats that were amazingly
crafted with gemstones and gold, and also stacks of utensils made of gold, silver, and bell metal.

They saw the stockpiles of heavenly aloe vera substances and sandalwood sticks and
depurated eatables, tubers, and fruits. 
They have also seen top-grade soft drinks, luscious honey, heaps of finest quality
clothing, exotic blankets, and sheaves of deerskins. 
Vanara-s have also observed mounds of undefiled gold stockpiled here and there
glowing with the glow of ritual fire. 
When searching here and there in that cavity those valiant vanara-s of high
resplendence have perceived some lady rather not far from them. 
They saw a sainted lady there who was attired in jute cloths and who was on a
controlled diet and who is like a luminiferous entity by her luminescence of asceticism.

In wonderment, the monkeys stood still all over, and in the matter of her identity
Hanuma asked her, "Who are you? Whose cavity is this, either? 
Then Hanuma whose shine is similar to that of a mountain making palm-fold and
reverencing that aged lady asked, "Who are you? Whose is this cavity, or the mansion or these
jewels? Please speak." That Hanuma, with coral-coloured face, very bright, the son of wind-god, wearing a humble and feeble 
look, approached Seetha by stepping down from the tree and offered her his salutation by keeping his joined palms 
on his head and spoke the following sweet words:
"O Lady with your eyes resembling lotus leaves, wearing a worn out silken cloth! O, the irreproachable 
one! You have stood, holding by the hand a branch of the tree who are you?"
"Tears of sorrow are gushing down from your eyes, as water is scattered down from two lotus-petals. 
Why?"
"O auspicious lady! In whom are you born-whether in celestials or in ogres or in serpent-demons 
or in celestial musicians or in demons or in semi-divine beings or in mythical beings?"
"O lovely-faced woman! Who are you among eleven Rudras who bestow strength, or among Maruts the 
storm-gods or among eight Vasus the beneficent gods? O Handsome lady with fine hips! You appear to me as a deity."
"Are you Rohini, endowed with all the best qualities, fallen from heaven, left behind by moon and 
excellent among stars."
"O dark-eyed lady! Are you not the auspicious Arundhati, who irritated her husband, Vasishta the 
sage either by anger or by error?"
"O the slender waisted lady! You seem to be lamenting over someone who died is he your son, or 
father or brother or husband."
"You are lamenting. You are sighing a lot. You are touching the earth. You have royal insignia 
in you. According to these things, I do not consider you as a divine woman."
"Based on the marks on your person and your bodily characteristics, I believe you to be a queen 
of an emperor and the daughter of a king."
"If you are Seetha stolen per force by Ravana from Janasthana, tell it to me who is asking if you 
please!"
"According to your miserable state, the super-human beautiful figure and your costume endowed with 
austerity, surely you are Rama's wife."
Hearing his words, Seetha was delighted of Rama's mention and spoke the following words to Hanuma, 
who was dwelling on a tree.
"I am the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, eminent among the excellent kings on earth, who understands 
the nature of the spirit and who torments the army of the adversary."
"I am the daughter of the noble-natured Janaka, the king of Videha kingdom. I am know.
"I stayed in Rama's house there for twelve years, enjoying the worldly pleasures belonging to human 
kind and fulfilling all my desires."
"Thereafter, in the thirteenth year, King Dasaratha along with his preceptors started to perform 
anointment of the kingdom to Rama, a celebrity of Ikshvaku dynasty."
"While that anointment of Rama was being arranged, a queen called Kaikeyi spoke the following words 
to Dasaratha, her husband.
"If Rama gets anointed for the kingdom, from now onwards, I shall neither drink water nor take 
my food daily. This is the end to my life."
"O the excellent king! If that word of pledge was uttered affectionately by you and if it is not 
going to be a waste, let Rama go to the forest."
"Hearing the cruel and the disagreeable words of Kaikeyi and recollecting the boon given to the 
queen, King Dasaratha who was true to his word, fell unconscious.
"Then, the aged king, who was firmly established in truth and righteousness, regretfully asked 
his illustrious eldest son to give back the kingdom, which he bestowed him earlier."
"That glorious Rama first admitted his father's words in mind, considering them more dearer than 
his anointment to the kingdom and accepted them with his word."
"The truly courageous Rama always gives anything to others and does not take anything from others. 
He does not speak just a little of a disagreeable word even for the cause of his life."
"Leaving behind his greatly valuable outer garments and wearing garments made of bark, that highly 
illustrious Rama gave up his kingdom willingly and assigned me to his mother."
"To me bereft of him, residing even in heaven does not indeed give pleasure. I, as such, decided 
to proceed to the forest and soon was ready to start even ahead of Rama."
"Adorned with clothes of bark, the illustrious Lakshmana, the rejoice of his friends, got ready 
to follow his elder brother even before (me)."
"Obeying respectfully the command of Lord Dasaratha, we as such with a firm resolution, entered 
the forest, which we have never seen before and which was deep and profound in appearance."
While Rama of great vigour was dwelling in the forest of Dandaka, the evil-minded demon, Ravana 
took me, Rama's wife, away."
"A period of two months of survival-benefit has been given to me by him. For that reason, after 
the said two months, I shall give up my life."Hearing that narration about Rama from Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, Seetha in a sweet voice 
spoke the following gentle words:
"Where was your contact with Rama? How do you know Lakshmana? How did the union between monkeys 
and men arise?"
"O Hanuma! What are the characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana? Narrate them to me, so that sorrow 
will not take possession of me again."
"Of what kind was the appearance of that Rama and Lakshmana? Of what kind was their form? How 
were the thighs? How were the arms? Tell me."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma, the son of the wind god, then started to describe Rama according 
to his actual state (as follows):
"O Seetha having eyes resembling lotus leaves! By my fortune, you are enquiring about the appearance 
of Rama your husband, and Lakshmana, even though you know about them. Alas! what a pleasure!"
"O the large-eyed Seetha! I tell the characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana as I recognized them; 
hear them from me."
"O Seetha the daughter of Janaka! Rama has his eyes resembling the petals of a lotus. He has a 
handsomeness, attracting the hearts of all living beings. He is endowed with grace and dexterity, by birth."
"He is equal to the sun in splendor, earth in endurance, Brihaspati in intelligence, and Indra 
in fame."
"Rama the tormentator of his adversaries, is a protector of the world of beings, further protecting 
his people. He is the protector of his behavior and righteousness.
"O Seetha! Rama is the protector of the four castes of the world. He is the doer and also the agent 
for the people's propriety of conduct."
"Rama is a resplendent man. He is respected exceedingly. He is established in a vow of chastity. 
He knows how to do good to virtuous people. He knows the application and advantage of his actions."
"He is well trained in statesmanship. He honors Brahmins, the priestly class. He possesses sacred 
knowledge. He is endowed with good conduct. He is a modest man. He torments his adversaries."
"He got trained in Yajurveda, the sacrificial Veda. He is highly honoured by those well-versed 
in Vedas. He is skilled in Dhanurveda, the science of archery, other Vedas, and the six limbs* of Vedangas."
"O princess! Rama is a broad-shouldered and long-armed man. He has a shell-like neck. He has 
a handsome countenance. He has a hidden collarbone. He has beautiful red eyes. His fame is heard about by people."
"He has a voice like the sound of a kettle drum. He has a shining skin. He is full of splendor. 
He is square-built. His limbs are built symmetrically. He is endowed with a dark-brown complexion."
"He is ever firm in three limbs (viz. the breast, waist, and fist), long in three (viz. the breast, 
waist, and fist), long in three (viz. the eyebrows, arms, and soles), uniform in three (viz. his locks, testicle, and knees, elevated in three (viz. his breast, rim of his navel and lower abdomen), coppery in three of the navel 
and the lower abdomen), coppery in three (viz. the rims of his eyes, nails, palms, and soles), soft in three (viz. 
the lines on his soles, hair, and the end of the membrane virile) and always deep in three (viz. the voice, gait, and the navel)."
"He has three folds in the skin of his neck and belly. He is depressed in three places (viz. the 
middle of his soles, the lines on his soles, and the nipples). He is undersized at four places (viz. the neck, 
membrane virile, the back, and the shanks). He is endowed with three spirals in the hair of his head. He has four 
lines at the root of his thumb (denoting his proficiency in the four Vedas). He has four lines on his forehead 
(indicating longevity). He is four cubits high (96 inches). He has four pairs of limbs (viz. the cheeks, arms, 
shanks, and knees) equally matched."
"He has fourteen other pairs of limbs (viz. the eyebrows, nostrils, eyes, ears, lips, nipples, 
elbows, wrists, knees testicles, lions, hands, feet, and thighs) equally matched. The four large teeth at both 
the ends of his upper and lower jaws are very sharp. He walks in four gaits (resembling the walks of a lion, a 
tiger, an elephant, and a bull). He is endowed with excellent lips, chin, and nose. He has five glossy limbs (viz. 
the hair, eyes, teeth, skin, and soles). He has eight long limbs (viz. the arms, fingers and toes, eyes and ears, 
thighs and shanks).
"Rama has ten lotus-like limbs (viz. the countenance, the mouth, the eyes, the tongue, lips, palate, 
breasts, nails, the hands, and the feet). He has ten ample limbs (viz. the chest, the head, the forehead, the neck, 
the arms, the heart, the mouth the feet, the back, and the ears). He is spread through because of three (viz. 
splendor, renown, and glory). He is doubly pure (on his father's and mother's side). He is elevated in six limbs (viz. 
the flanks, the abdomen, the breast, the nose, the shoulders, and the forehead). He is small, thin, fine, or sharp 
in nine (viz. the hair, the mustaches, and the beard, nails the hair on the body, the skin, the finger joints, 
the membrum virile, acumen, and perception). He pursues religious merit, worldly riches, and sensuous delight 
in three periods (viz. the forenoon, midday, and afternoon).
"Rama is engrossed in truth and righteousness. He is a prosperous man. He is interested in reception 
and facilitation. He knows how to apportion place and time. He speaks affectionately with all."
"The invincible Lakshmana, the son of Rama's step-mother and Rama's brother, is resembling Rama 
in appearance, affection, and qualities."
"Rama and Lakshmana, the two tigers among men, very anxiously desirous of seeing you and searching 
all over the earth, came in contact with us."
"Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, wandering only in search of you all over the earth, saw 
Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys, sitting on the top of Rishyamuka mountain, filled with several trees, has been 
dethroned by his elder brother, oppressed with fear, but who was pleasant to the sight."
"We for one are serving that Sugreeva, the Lord of monkeys, who was true to his promise but was 
dethroned from the kingdom from his elder brother."
"In the meanwhile, those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, wearing clothes made of bark and arming 
the best bows came to the charming place of Rishyamuka mountain."
"Seeing Rama and Lakshmana, the excellent of men, coming with bows in hand, that Sugreeva the best 
of monkeys was deluded with fear and jumped over to the hilltop of that mountain."
"Thereafter, stationed on that hill-top, that Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, very soon sent me only, 
to approach those two brothers."
"On that command of Sugreeva, I reached saluting those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana the excellent 
and capable men, endowed with good form and characteristics."
"Those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, the excellent among men, were fully endowed with kindness, 
after knowing the exact position about Sugreeva. Then, I made Rama and Lakshmana ascend on my back and took 
them to Sugreeva's place."
"I informed the high-souled Sugreeva about the true position of Rama and Lakshmana. After a mutual 
conversation between those two brothers and Sugreeva, a great friendship developed among them."
"Thus endowed with friendship, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, and Rama the best of men, by talking 
together of their earlier occurrences, developed confidence."
"Thereafter, Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana, through the extremely effulgent Vali the 
brother of Sugreeva, consoled Sugreeva who was earlier expelled from the kingdom; (by Vali), for the sake of Ruma 
a woman."
"Then, Lakshmana informed Sugreeva the king of monkeys about the sadness of Rama, (who is unwearied 
in action), born out of your disappearance."
"Hearing the words of Lakshmana, Sugreeva then became highly dim-witted, as the sun becomes dim 
when overpowered by an eclipse."
"Thereafter, all those multitudes of ornaments which adorned your body, which were being tried to 
be snatched away by Ravana and which were dropped onto the earth, were brought by monkey-leaders joyfully 
and shown to Rama. But the monkey leaders did not know the further course of your movement."
"I indeed brought those ornaments near to Rama and gave them to him. Then, soon after receiving 
them, Rama lost his consciousness, and the resounding ornaments were scattered all over."
"That Lord Rama looking like god, kept those beautiful ornaments of yours in his flank and lamented 
in many ways."
"While seeing those ornaments, Rama was lamenting and getting suffocated again and again. Thus, 
those ornaments ignited the fire of Rama's grief."
"That grief-stricken mighty man was thus lying on the floor for a long time. Then, with great difficulty, 
I made him get up by telling several consoling words."
"That long-armed Rama, along with Lakshmana, after seeing those ornaments, examined them, again 
and again. He later gave them to Sugreeva."
"O the kind mistress! As you were being unseen, Rama was tormented forever with a great flaming 
fire of grief, like a volcano."
"For your sake, insomnia, grief, and worry were tormenting that great souled Rama, as flames torment 
a burning house."
"By the grief caused by your not being seen, Rama is trembled with grief, as a high mountain is 
trembled by a great earthquake."
"O princess! In not seeing you, Rama is not obtaining delight, even while moving in quite charming 
forests, encompassing rivers and waterfalls."
"O Seetha the daughter of Janaka! That Rama the excellent of men will receive you, soon after, 
killing Ravana along with Ravana's friends and relatives."
"That day when Rama and Sugreeva were together, both of them made an agreement that Rama would 
annihilate Vali and Sugreeva will arrange for a search of you."
"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the two valiant princes reached Kishkindha. Rama killed Vali the 
king of monkeys there in a combat."
"After killing Vali in combat using his strength, Rama made Sugreeva the king for the entire 
multitude of bears and monkeys."
"O princess! A friendship was held well in such a manner between Rama and Sugreeva. Know me as 
Hanuma, who came here as a messenger on behalf of both of them."
"Having got his kingdom, Sugreeva summoned mighty as well as capable monkeys and sent them 
to ten different directions in search of you."
"As commanded by Sugreeva of great splendor and the king of monkeys, those monkeys resembling 
Himalayan mountains, started on all directions of the earth."
"Then, we along with other monkeys too who are eager to fulfill the command of Sugreeva, are wandering 
the entire earth in search of you."
"An excellent monkey named Angada, possessed of fortune, son of Vali, and having great strength, 
taking one-third of the army along with him, set out in search of you."
"Several days and nights passed, filled as we were with grief, having got lost our way intensely 
in a mountain range called Vindhya."
"We were determined to forsake our lives because of despair in our non-fulfillment of work, in 
our overstepping of the limit given by Sugreeva and in fear of the King Sugreeva."
"Having searched in places difficult of access in forests, at mountains and cascades and not 
obtaining any indication of you the princess, we were ready to give up our lives."
"O Seetha! Seeing all the excellent monkeys sitting down and calmly awaiting the approach of 
death, Angada was very much immersed in the ocean of sorrow and lamented about your loss, the killing of Vali, 
the death of Jatayu and our practice of calmly awaiting the approach of death in simply sitting down."
"For us who lost all our hopes on our lives and were willing to give up our lives as per the command 
of Sugreeva, as though for the sake of our need alone, a great valiant bird came there."
"Hearing about the killing of his brother, the vulture-king Sampati the brother of slain Jatayu 
the King of vultures spoke (the following) words in anger:
"O the best of monkeys! Tell me who, where, and how my younger brother Jabali was killed and made 
to fall."
"Then, Angada told Sampati a detailed account of events that led to the killing of that great 
bird at Janasthana, by a demon of terrific form, for your sake."
"O Seetha with an excellent waist! Hearing about the slaughter of Jatayu, that Sampati the son 
of Aruna was very much pained and said that you were staying in Ravana's house."
"Hearing those delightful words of Sampati, we with our Chief Angada started soon from there."
"The monkeys were very much delighted. They were making up their energy to see you, 
rose from Vindhya mountain, and reached the northern shore of the ocean."
"All the monkeys with their Chief Angada, in their anxiety to see you, reached the ocean. They 
were frightened after seeing the ocean there and they were again worried."
"Thereafter, seeing the ocean, I removed the serious fears of the army of monkeys who were worrying 
and crossed a hundred Yojanas across the sea."
"Entering even Lanka, filled with demons in the night, I saw Ravana and you too who were immersed 
in grief."
"O the faultless princess! I told you all this has occurred. I am the messenger of Rama. 
Talk to me."
"O princess! I made an effort on Rama's behalf and came here for your sake. I am Sugreeva's minister. 
I am the son of the wind god. Know me, as such."
"You Rama, the excellent man among all the wielders of bow, are safe. Lakshmana, who is engaged 
in the service of his elder brother and possessing good characteristics, is also safe."
"O princess! I, who am interested in the welfare of the valiant Rama, your husband, came here alone 
on the command of Sugreeva."
"I, who can change my form at will, desirous of finding out your access, wandering alone without 
any helper came to this southern direction."
"I shall remove the anguish of the army of monkeys who are lamenting because of your disappearance 
by informing them about my coming close to you because of my good fortune!"
"O princess! By my fortune, my crossing of the ocean has not gone in vain. I can get this fame by having 
seen you because of my good luck."
"The highly valiant Rama, by killing Ravana the Lord of demons along with his friends and relatives, 
will obtain you soon."
"O Seetha! There is a mountain called Malyavan, which is the best among the mountains. From there, 
a monkey called Kesari went to another mountain called Gokarna."
"As prayed by gods and seers, that great monkey called Kesari, my father killed a demon named Shambasadana 
at a sacred shrine near the sea shore."
"O Seetha! I am born in the womb of the wife of that Kesari the monkey, by the grace of the wind god. 
By my activity alone, I am renowned as Hanuma in this world."
"O Seetha! I described the qualities of Rama, your husband, to cause trust in you. O the faultless 
princess! Rama will take you from here within a short time."
Thus inspired by confidence because of the above reasons, Seetha emaciated with grief, by adequate 
clues served as proof.
Seetha obtained unequal delight. She released tears of joy from her eyes having curved eye-lashes, 
with a thrill of delight.
The countenance of that large-eyed Seetha, who is beautiful, whose eyes are red-white and long 
is shining like a moon, the king of stars liberated from Rahu the demon.
Seetha considered Hanuma clearly as a monkey and not otherwise. Thereafter Hanuma replied to her 
who is pleasant to the sight (as follows)
"O Seetha! I told you indeed all this please be consoled. Tell me what I can do for you and also 
what is agreeable to you. I am going back now."
"O Seetha! As provoked by the sages, Kesari, the valiant monkey killed a demon called Shambasadana 
in battle. I am a monkey born through wind-god and through his influence, I am equal to the wind-god in strength."The mighty armed Rama, the conqueror of hostile cities sallied forth with the
resonant roll of kettle drums, mingled with the blast of couches.
Hearing that sound, Ravana the Lord of demons, paused for a moment to reflect and
looked towards his ministers.
Ravana of great strength the tormentor of the world, and a cruel lord of demons then
addressed all his ministers in a voice that resounded the entire hall as follows, accusing
none.
"I have heard what you told me about Rama's crossing the ocean, his prowess,
strength and heroism."
"I know that you are truly brave in the battle-field, yet, on beholding that valiant
Rama, you too look on each other in silence."
Hearing those word of Ravana whose maternal grandfather he was, the highly
intelligent demon called Malyavan, answered him thus:
"O, king! He who is well-versed in (fourteen)* sciences and follows the path of
prudence, enjoys sovereignty for a long time and compels his enemies too into subjugation."
"He who concludes peace even with enemies or wages war at a fitting time strengthens
his own party and attains a great power."
"A treaty of peace should be reached by a king who is weaker or equal to an enemy.
The king should never underrate that enemy. If the king is more powerful, he should make war on the
enemy."
"O, Ravana! For that reason, alliance with Rama finds favour with me. Let Seetha,
for whose sake you are being attacked, be restored to him."
"All the celestials, sages and Gandharvas the celestial musicians are wishing for
victory of Rama. Do not get an enmity with them. Let alliance with him be acceptable to you."
"Brahma, the lord of creation, created only two classes of beings, the celestials
and the demons. Celestials take refuge in righteousness and demons in unrighteousness."
"O, Ravana! Righteous is said to be on the side of the high-souled celestials.
Unrighteousness is indeed on the side of ogres and demons."
"When righteousness swallows unrighteousness, it becomes kR^ita Yuga, a golden age.
When unrighteousness swallows righteousness, it incites Kali Yuga the fourth age."
"Therefore, while you were wandering in the worlds, even the great righteousness was
destroyed and unrighteousness favoured by you. So, the enemies are stronger than us."
"Due to your negligence, that well nourished unrighteousness is swallowing us. Being
favourable to demons, the sect of demons is thereby getting augmented."
"You, who are interested in sensual enjoyments, doing whatever you like, have
created a great alarm in the sages, having the nature of fire."
"The power of those sages is insurmountable like an igniting fire. Having purified
their minds through penance, they are intent on promotion of righteousness, in as much as these
Brahamans worship the gods through different principal sacrifices, also pour oblations into the
sacred fires with due ceremony and read the Vedas (Sacred texts) in a loud voice. Having subdued
the demons, they continued to chant the sacred text, on hearing which all the demons scattered in
all directions, as thundering clouds in a hot season."
"The smoke coming forth from the sacred fire of the sage who resemble the fire (in
brilliance), enveloping the ten directions, takes away the magical power of the demons."
"The severe austerity practised by the sages, firm of resolve, in different
countries torment the demons."
"You received a boon of invincibility from celestials, demons and semi-divine
beings, but then are men, bears as well as powerful and very efficacious having strong prowess who
are coming hither, roaring like lions."
"By seeing various kinds of unexpected events (portents) and many types of terrific
things, I am perceiving a destruction of all the demons."
"With terrifying clamour, monstrous clouds, inspiring horror, rain hot blood on
Lanka on every side."
"Drops of tears drop from the weeping elephants, horses etc., whose skins became
discoloured, covered with dust and are not shining as before."
"Flesh-eating animals, jackals and eagles and howling horribly. Entering Lanka, they
are in the groves, forming into groups."
"Black women, chattering incoherently in dreams and robbing different houses stand
in front, laughing loudly with their white teeth."
"Dogs devour the sacred offerings offered in homes. Donkeys are born of cows and
rats of mongoose."
"Cats mate with tigers, pigs with dogs, Kinnaras (a species of demi-gods with the
human figure and the head of a horse or with a horse's body and the head of a man) with demons and
men."
"Red-footed and white pigeons, messengers of death, move in different directions,
foretelling the extermination of demons."
"Domesticated minas (a kind of birds) making a chirping sound, defeated by other
bellicose birds drop down, being twined together in groups."
"Birds and wild animals, facing towards the sun, cry out. Death, in the form of a
frightful, monstrous and cruel blackish fellow with a shaven head casts his eyes on all our
dwellings, both morning and evening. These and such other sinister omens appear."
"I deem Rama of firm fortitude as Vishnu dwelling in human form. This Rama is not a
mere human being, he by whom that most wonderful bridge was built across the sea. O, Ravana!
Conclude peace with Rama, who is the king of men. Having come to know of his acts, let that which
is good for the future be done after a mature understanding."
Having spoken thus, the mighty Malyavan, who was foremost in valour among the
bravest warriors, being aware of what was passing in Ravana's mind, eyeing him, became silent.As those ogre women with a cruel nature were speaking a lot harshly and horribly, Seetha cried.
Thus being spoken to by ogre women, Seetha with a good mind being frightened a lot spoke as follows 
with a voice indistinct due to tears.
"A human woman is not suited to become a wife of an ogre. All of you eat me according to your desire. 
I will not do according to your words."
Being in the middle of ogre women, being frightened by Ravana also, like a daughter of gods, that 
Seetha did not get comfort from being tormented by grief.
Like a fawn in a forest lost from its herd and tormented by wolves, Seetha was as though sinking 
into their own body and shook a lot.
That Seetha with a broken heart due to grief, held a wide flowering branch of the Ashoka tree and thought 
about Her husband.
Then that Seetha washing Her wide breasts with a flow of tears from eyes and thinking, did not 
get the end of sorrow.
That Seetha was shaking like a plantain tree fallen in an exceedingly windy place, trembling 
with fear of the ogre women, and became with a pale face.
That moving plait, which was wide and long, of that best woman was seen to be like a serpent in 
motion.
That Seetha tormented by grief, with a mind hit by sorrow, struck by calamity was sighing and let 
down tears and also cried.
Seetha being tormented by grief said: "Oh! Rama!" and again "Oh! Lakshmana!","Oh! Kausalya!, my 
mother-in-law" "Oh! Sumitra!"
"I thus being tormented by cruel ogre women here lacking Rama, being tormented by grief, when I 
am living even for a moment,' death at the wrong time to woman or a man is hard' - thus being said this popular 
saying in the world is true."
"This me with small merit,wretched, like an orphan, will perish like a ship in the middle of the 
the ocean being hit by the speed of the wind."
"Not seeing my husband that Rama and obtaining control of ogre women like a bank hit by water I 
am verily perishing with sorrow."
"Only fortunate see that my husband with eyes like petals of an expanded lotus, walking with the 
the gait of a lion, correct in conduct, and a pleasant talker."
"To me lacking that Rama with a famous soul, like after eating a pungent poison life in all ways 
is hard."
"By what this horrible and very dreadful grief is obtained by me, what kind of great sin had been 
done by me in another life."
"Together with great grief, I desire to give away my life. This desire is not obtainable by me. 
I am well protected by ogre women."
"Fie upon human condition! Fie upon being in the control of others. By what reason it is not possible 
according to their desire to give up life.To Rama, the scion of Raghu and her husband, who started out when permitted by Sage Suteekshna, Vaidehi 
spoke this with friendly words. 
"Gross unjust will accrue to any in an abstruse way if his indulgence is enkindled merely by his own 
desire, and in this world it is possible to fend them off, to have a recourse to justness... 
"Only three self-gratifications, the definite products of desire, are there: one is speaking fallacious 
utterances, which itself is worse, and worst than the other two malefic self-gratifications, where the 
other two are the fascination for other's wife, and the cruelness without enmity... 
Hunting, sleeping in daytime, abusing others, indulgence in women, three artistic impulses namely music, 
dance and drama, wasteful wandering, are the ten desire. Manu smriti.
"The habit of telling specious words is not there with you in the past nor it will be there in future, 
oh, Raghava, then wherefrom the virtue-ruining desire for other's women can be there... 
"Oh, king, earlier this vile desire for other's women is absent in you, nor it is there now, unobserved 
is such a desire in any corner of your heart oh, prince, for you are always interested in your own wife... 

"You are conscientious, adherent of truth, and obliging father's orders, and in you virtue and truth, 
nay everything is established in you... 
"Oh, dextrous one, all this can possibly be shouldered by one with controlled senses, and oh, graceful 
one for a gaze, I am also aware of your sense control... 
"That third tendency to torture others' lives without enmity, that which will usually be effectuated 
unwarily, has now suddenly chanced before you... 
"Intending to safeguard the sages you have promised the dwellers in Dandaka forest, oh, valiant one, 
that you would eliminate demons in a fight... 
"Only in this respect you have started towards the well-known Dandaka forest along with your brother, 
and wielding bow and arrows...
"Then on seeing your starting my mind is apprehensively upset, on verily reflecting about your bearing 
there appears to be no beneficial good for you... 
"Oh, brave one, your going towards Dandaka forest is not delightful to me, I tell the cause for that 
and listen to it as I tell...
"Indeed on entering the forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows, seeing the forest 
ramblers there, won't you deplete arrows on all of them... 
"The bow of warrior and the fuel of a burning fire if available within their reach, they immensely enhance 
their strength... 
"Once upon a time, oh, dextrous one, there was a pious and true worded hermit in some merited forest 
that was wonted by animals and birds... 
"Then Indra came to that hermitage handling a sword, and donning a soldier's guise, to cause hindrance 
to that hermit's ascesis... 
"Indra gave that best sword to store, there in that hermitage to that sage who is lasting in his ascesis, 
on a redeemable basis... 
"On receiving that sword, he who is duteous in guarding the entrustment, moved about in the forest always 
handling the sword, to safeguard the confidence reposed in him... 
"Wherever that dedicated guardian of that entrustment goes, even to obtain tubers or fruits, he did 
not go without that sword... 
"Carrying that sword always, that hermit slowly made his own faculty infuriated, loosing determination 
in ascesis... 
"Then with the constant association of that weapon that sage gradually became inadvertent, and smitten 
by vice he went to hell... 
"Thus, all this happened earlier, only owing the reason of associating with a weapon constantly, and 
the sequel of constant association with weapon is as good as constant association with fire... 
"In affinity and in respect I am reminding but not tutoring you, and in anyway improper is that thought 
of yours to wield your bow to kill the demons dwelling in Dandaka without any enmity, oh, brave one, 
undesirable is the killing of offenceless... 
"For the valiant Kshatriya-s who are inclined in forests heartily, the purpose of the bow is this much 
'safeguarding the sufferers...' 
"Where that weapon? Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? And where is sageness? All 
this is inconsistent... let us esteem the laws of the land... 
"Weapon admiring mind becomes maligned with avariciousness, you may therefore follow the tenet of Kshatriya-s 
on going to Ayodhya again... 
"Everlasting satisfaction will be there to my father-in-law and mothers-in-laws, on your becoming a 
devout sage even after forfeiture of kingdom... 
"From virtuousness prosperity emanates, from righteousness happiness, and by honourableness all are 
achieved, and this universe is the essence of probity... 
"Experts will make efforts to exhaust their own selves with those and those principles, thus they realise 
sublimity... unachievable is pleasure by pleasuring alone... 
"Always tread along the righteousness with a pure mind, oh, gentle one, and specially in these sagely 
forests... you know everything in all the three worlds, in all its nuances... 
"I cite all this with my womanly waver, and who is capable to talk to you about dharma? Ponder mindfully 
along with your brother, and what that is appropriate, you do it...but not belatedly... 
This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, 
where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama's waging a war against demons. 
Seetha's doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number 
of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory 
in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying 'safeguard 
the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow..." as at verse -- above, and also questioning 
immediately at --, 'where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit's way of living...' etc., dharmaakuutam 
says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without 
resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way.ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad 
abhipraayakatvaat ||
She is inquisitive to know 
why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are 
having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven 
with their mortal bodies. Can't they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to 
heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. 
And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. 
Can't the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is 
the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the 
sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance.
Sage Vishvamitra, though 
being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered 
it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard 
their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests.
Secondly, Rama is subjected 
to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram 
should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit 
of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, 
Rama speaks to Vali -- "all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty 
to act in accordance with the decree of that throne..."
"Regarding the cause, Seetha's 
doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana.With a face continually shedding tears, Seetha a young woman, thus speaking with a downward face, 
started to weep.
Seetha was crying like a mad one, like an intoxicated one, with a deluded mind. Like a female horse 
rolling on the ground, Seetha rolled on the ground.
"While Rama was heedless (taken away by Mareecha), I who have been crying was forcibly brought 
overpowered by the ogre Ravana who can wear the desired form."
"Being under the control of ogresses, being frightened very horribly, thinking and being tormented 
by grief, I do not desire to live."
"Without Rama, a great car-warrior, living amid ogresses, there is no use with life 
to me; not with wealth, not with ornaments."
"Or my this heart truly is made of iron. It is undecaying and without death. By what reason is 
it not destroying with sorrow?"
"Whoever I with a sinful life made to be without Rama, protecting life even for a moment, to such 
me who am ignoble, who am bad wife, shame on me."
"Without husband Rama who is the lord of the earth with ocean at the end, a pleasant talker, what 
is the interest to me in life or comfort."
"I will leave the body. Let it be split into pieces or let it be eaten. I without a husband will 
not tolerate sorrow for a long time."
"I will not touch even with my left foot Ravana an ogre of reprehensible conduct. What to say of 
desiring him."
"Whoever Ravana with a cruel nature is desiring to solicit me, that Ravana does not know him to 
be refused; he does not know his race."
"Even if cut or divided into parts in a blazing fire, I will not reach Ravana. What is the use 
with your prattling for a long time?"
"Rama is famous, is a wise man, is compassionate with good conduct. Due to the deterioration 
of my fortune, I doubt He became hard-hearted."
"By whom alone fourteen thousand ogres have been destroyed, why is that Rama not saving me."
"I am withheld by the ogre Ravana with little strength. My husband is indeed capable of killing 
Ravana in a war."
"By which Rama Viradha, best among ogres, has been killed in Dandaka forest in a war, why is that 
He not saving me?"
"This city of Lanka being in the middle of the ocean is difficult to be attacked. But there will not 
be an obstacle to flying of Rama's arrows."
"What now is that reason by which Rama with a firm courage is not protecting His dear wife stolen 
by an ogre."
"I doubt that Rama elder to Laksmana does not know me to be here. After knowing that glorious 
Rama tolerate this outrage?"
"Whoever Jatayu nearing Rama will have let known to Rama that Seetha was stolen, that king of vultures 
has been killed by Ravana in war."
"A great deed has been done by that Jatayu, thus protecting me, although of old age, standing in 
a dual combat with Ravana."
"If that Rama knows me to be living here, with anger He will make the world to be without ogres 
with His arrows now."
"Rama will blow away the city of Lanka, will dry up the great ocean, will destroy the name and 
fame of Ravana."
"After that how I am crying in this way, in the same way, in every house, ogresses with killed husbands 
will cry again and again. There is no doubt in this."
"Rama together with Lakshmana will search the city of Lanka belonging to ogres. An enemy is seen by 
those two will indeed not live even for a moment."
"This Lanka shortly will become like a graveyard, with paths agitated with the smoke of funeral pyres, 
crowded with a group of vultures."
"In a short time only I will attain my desire. This evil course is telling of the destruction of you 
all."
"Here in Lanka whatever inauspicious things are being seen, from those, in a short while Lanka 
will become deprived of glory."
"While the sinful, vile ogre Ravana is being killed, Lanka which is unconquerable till now, definitely 
will get drying up like a woman who lost her husband."
"Now abounding in pious festivities, the city of Lanka with lost lord together with ogresses will 
become like a woman with a lost husband."
"In a short while here in every house I can hear the sound of ogresses crying being 
tormented by grief."
"The city of Lanka will become burnt by Rama's arrows together with darkness, with destroyed luster 
with killed best ogres."
"Will that Rama who is a strong man with red eye corners know me to be in the house of Ravana?"
"Whatever time has been ordered by this cruel and vilest of men Ravana, this time has come to me. 
That death decreed to me does not hold good to this evil one (Ravana)."
"Whoever sinful ogres who do not know what should not be done, due to their unrighteousness now 
there will be a great calamity. These meat-eating ogres do not know virtue."
"An ogre will eat me for breakfast. What should I do without Rama with a pleasing 
appearance? I am grieving a lot not seeing Rama with red eye corners."
"Now if there exists anyone who is a giver of poison here, I without husband quickly will see 
the god Yama."
"That Rama elder to Lakshmana may not know me to be alive. If those two know me to be alive, then 
it cannot be said that they will not do my search on earth."
"That valiant Rama who is the elder brother of Lakshmana due to grief of me, leaving the body on 
earth has gone to the celestial world. This is certain."
"Whoever is seeing my husband Rama with eyes resembling a lotus flower such Devas, Siddhas together 
with Gandharvas and great sages are fortunate."
"Or to that Rama with a desire in virtuousness, who is intelligent, a sage-king, the supreme spirit, 
there is no use with me, his wife."
"Friendly disposition will occur in what is being seen. There is no friendship to one who does 
not see. Ungrateful ones destroy friendship. But Rama will not destroy friendship."
"I who is a woman who is perishing without the chief Rama to such me are there no good qualities 
or has my fortune diminished."
"To me who is deprived of Rama with untroubled reputation, a warrior, annihilator of enemies, a 
great soul, more than living, death is good."
"Or those two brothers who are best among men giving up weapons in the forest may have become dwellers 
of forest eating roots and fruits."
"Or Rama and Lakshmana the warrior brothers may have been killed by the evil soul king of ogres 
Ravana by deceit."
"Under such circumstances and time, I in all ways am desiring to die. Even in this grief, 
death is not bestowed on me."
"Great souled ones with abandoned sins, with a conquered mind, those with great fortune, sages 
are indeed fortunate to whom there is no pleasure and displeasure."
"From pleasure sorrow and displeasure great fear do not occur to great souls. Whoever are 
separated from pleasure and displeasure, my obeisance to such great souls."
"Left by dear Rama with a well-known mind coming under the control of sinful Ravana, such I will 
leave breath of life.Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, on seeing the skyward flight of Ravana taking her
along became highly frantic and remaining in highest dismay she is distraught. 
Seetha whose eyes turned coppery-red with tears and resentment, still outpouring
tears while being abducted she piteously poured this scorn on that gory-eyed demon's chief, Ravana.

"You knave Ravana, you are taking flight on thieving me after prowling about my
loneliness, such as you are, are you not ashamed in the least for this subterfuge. 
"You black-hearted fiend, for sure, you alone sidelined my husband in a trickish
guise of Golden Deer wishful to abduct me as you are a coward. 
"Which king of eagles battled against you to bail me out, an old friend of my
father-in-law, such as he is he is also felled, indeed. 
"Ah, truly what an audacious audacity is shown by you... you basely demon... by
ear-shattering your great name saying that 'I am Ravana...' I am conquered in a combat -
Really?
"Am I conquered by you in a combat between my husband and you, wherein you on
announcing your name to my husband and truly showing your audacious audacity defeated my husband,
and thus triumphing over me - or what? Tell me, you mousy demon...
"Unable to conquer my husband in a combat, but able to earbash your name to a lonely
woman and abducting her, will this tantamount to your apparently audacious audacity? Thus, I am not
really triumphed over by a lowly demon like you... 
"A woman, that too a lonely one, that too the other man's wife, that too an
abduction, but not winning or wooing her... you knave, on your undertaking such a kind of
deplorable deed, how unashamed are you? 
"A self-glorifier as you are, this highly inhuman, iniquitous, imputable deed of
yours will be recounted by all men in all worlds. 
"Damn with what you have said then about your might and mettle... damn with this
kind of your demeanour which is lamentable to whole of your clan in this world. 
"What can be done possibly... why because you are fleeing very speedily in this
way... wait for a moment to ascertain whether you can go back in aliveness... 
"On your coming into the line of sight of those two princes, even if you are with
whole of your military, you will be incapacitated to live on, indeed even for a moment...

"Anywise it will be incapable of you to endure the touch of their arrows, as with a
bird that cannot endure the overly flaring up wildfire in a forest. 
"Oh, Ravana, positively contemplate in your soul and politely release me... and if
you do not release me, indeed by the rancour of insulting me, my husband along with his brother
devises your doom... 
"You rogue! By which endeavour you are desirous of thieving me under duress, that
endeavour of yours behoves absurd. 
"Though I am in aliveness now, but on my going under the control of an enemy and on
unseeing godlike husband of mine I am indeed unenthused to bear up my lives for a long.

"Definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either that which is
worthwhile or that which is beneficial to you, as mortals undertake a quirkily behaviour at the
time of their death...
"At the time of their death mortals wish to enjoy noxious and non-recuperative
foods, thus definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either nontoxic or beneficial
nourishments for your well-being. 
"But which is recuperative that is unpalatable to all of the death-rattlers, and
indeed, I behold you as one around whose throat the noose of Time is looped. 
"As you are dauntless in this daunting situation as for yourself, oh, Decahedral
demon, indeed it is clear that you are clearly fantasising the ill-omened golden trees all around.

"Oh, Ravana, you will see the ghastly River Vaitarani which will be tumultuously
streaming with blood streams, also thus you will see the grisly sword-leaved-forests in hell.

"You will see silk-cotton trees flowered with molten gold, shrouded with lapis
gemlike melting leaves, and enshrouded with sharp irony thorns in hell. 
"Oh, unmerciful one, on doing this kind of misdeed to that noble-souled Rama you are
incapable to bear up life for a long time like the one who quaffed venom. 
"You are bound by the unpreventable lasso of the Time, oh, Ravana, on going where
you will get complacency from that uncompromising husband of mine? 
"By whom fourteen thousand demons are killed in war just within a minute,
single-handedly without any help from his brother, how then that brave and mighty Raghava, an
expert in all kinds of missiles, will not eliminate you, the stealer of his chosen wife, with his
mordant arrows?" Thus Seetha poured forth her ire at Ravana. 
On saying this much and other exacting words, Vaidehi who has gone onto the flank of
Ravana, indeed lamented lamentably as her dismay is coalesced with her distress. 
She who is highly agonised and weeping before talking, a ranter who ranted much, a
resentful lady who has come of age, and a pitiable whirler in the hands of demon whose whirligig
has transformed into spasmodic jerking of her body for deliverance from that sinner, and in that
way that sinner stole that princess Seetha. Vaidehi has not seen any rescuer while she is abducted, but she has seen five
prominent vanara-s staying on a mountaintop. 
That broad-eyed and curvaceous lady with resentment Seetha, inwrapping her
auspicious ornaments in the upper-fringe of her sari, dropped in the midmost of those five Vanara-s
with a thinking that 'these creatures may perhaps indicate them to Rama.' 
On his part that Decahedron Ravana has not noticed her action in whipping up her
silky upper-cloth and ornaments, their bundling and stowing away at five vanara-s, owing to his own
hurry. 
Those ochreish-eyed best Vanara-s with their unwinking eyes have observed the
broad-eyed Seetha, who at that time is verily wailing. 
The chief of demons Ravana captivating Maithili, who is still wailing, has crossed
the Pampa region down underneath and advanced facing the City of Lanka. 
Ravana is jubilantly happy in stealing his own death alias Seetha, as one would
carry a stingingly fanged and lethally venomous she-snake in his own lap. 
He bolted out in skyway up above the woodlands, waterways, pools, and mountains at
the double, as with an arrow bolting from a bow. 
On reaching the ocean, a housing for sharks, alligators, a home of Rain-god, a
never-draining deep and an ultimate course of the rivers, he hastily crossed it over. 
That ocean being the abode of Rain-god is highly flustered when Vaidehi is being
abducted over it, and its waves became topsy-turvy and its fishes and great marine-reptiles
remained shilly-shally. 
Then the siddha-s and caarana-s available in airspace averred saying, "this alone is
the end of Decahedron Ravana." 
Ravana entered the city of Lanka transporting Seetha, while she wriggling in his
flank, who appeared like the personified death of Ravana wriggling its way into his Lanka.

On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, then he entered
his own palace-chambers which is with very many doors and chambers thronging with crowds.
On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, he then entered
his own palace chambers in which royal servants are thronging at many doorways as that palace has
very many chambers. 
Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya once kept his
lady-love, a nymphet called Hema, in a demonic Black Hole.
Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya kept his demonic
power in a Black Hole.
Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya had once kept al his
demonic scriptures duly usurping them from his own mentor, namely Shukracaarya, at an unknown
illusory place. 
That Decahedron Ravana also instructed the bogey-sightly bogeywomen, "your watch and
ward shall be in such a way that neither a female nor a male can see Seetha impermissibly."

"Whatever she wishes to have, gold, jewels, pearls, apparels or adornments, they all
be given to her as you would give me according to my whimsies. 
"Whosoever speaks unpleasant words to Vaidehi in the least, either unknowingly or
knowingly, her life becomes unpleasant for herself." Thus Ravana ordered the chamber-demonesses.

On speaking to those demonesses thus that chief of demons exited from that palace
chamber, and giving a thought to what is to be done in sequel, then he gave audience to eight
highly vigorous demons, the feasters on raw-flesh. 
He who is egocentric by the boon awarded by Brahma for his invincibleness, that
Ravana on giving an audience to those eight demons spoke this sentence to them praiseful of their
might and valour. 
"You immediately take up multiple assaultive weaponry and begone from here to
Janasthaana speedily, a place now deadpanned for demons, which earlier was the placement of Khara.

"Throwaway your fright faraway and you stay in that Janasthaana which fell void as
the demons are voided by someone called Rama, and there you shall stay self-assuredly and
self-confidently. 
"Though highly forceful forces are deployed in Janasthaana, Rama's arrows have
utterly destroyed them, together with Khara and Duushana. 
"Thereby an unprecedented fury is escalating over and above my courage, and an
unhindered and unforgivable animosity towards that Rama is evoked in me. 
"I wish to cast out my begrudging against my enemy who bears a grudge against me,
and indeed, to me 'sleep' is not the word for it, until my enemy is undone in a war. 
"I for myself will be comfortable only on eliminating him who has eliminated Khara
and Duushana as with a pauper acquiring riches. 
"While you remain in Janasthaana you have to accurately bring me the information
about Rama's activities and deportment. 
"Do not go heedlessly, you all night-walkers, for that Rama appears to be too
dangerous, and on your going there heedfully, you have to continually try for the elimination of
that Raghava. 
"I am aware of your might in battle fronts for a number of times, as such I have
commissioned you all in that Janasthaana." Thus Ravana spoke to those eight demons. 
Then on picking up those words amiable to all intents and purposes of Ravana, those
eight demons departed from Lanka on hailing Ravana, and they collectively journeyed in the
direction of Janasthaana with their imperceivable appearances. 
Ravana is then highly gladdened well and truly on gaining over Seetha, and even for
holding sway over that Maithili, and equally for the well-wrought and archly animosity with Rama,
whereby that demon Ravana is hypocritically amused. To her who was in such circumstances, who was in distress, who was irreproachable, devoid of joy 
and dejected but virtuous, was bestowed with auspicious omens, as a prosperous man is bestowed with dependent 
servants.
The beautifully haired Seetha's left eye, which was auspicious, whose surrounding row of eye-lashes 
were curved, which was black, wide, and bright-looking; was predominantly quivering, like a red lotus quivered 
by the blow of a fish.
Her left shoulder, which was pretty, distinguished beefy, and round, deserved to be applied 
with excellent black aloe and sandalwood paste, which had been used
Of her two thighs kept together, the left thigh which was beefy and well-born, resembled the 
the trunk of a princely elephant was predominantly quivering and spoke indistinctly of the existence of Rama in front.
Again, the clothing of Seetha standing there, of spotless eyes and charming limbs, having teeth 
resembling the buds of jasmine, which was of golden shade and was slightly soiled as it were with dust, glided 
down, which appeared auspicious (for her).
Bolstered by these and some other omens which straight explained that they were fruitful on the 
earlier occasion also, Seetha of beautiful eyebrows disclosed a great joy, even as a seed vanished and withered 
by the wind and the sun, got sprouted by rain.
Moreover, having the lips resembling Bimba fruit, having beautiful eyes and eyebrows, whose eye 
lids are curved, having charming white teeth, her face shone like the moon liberated from the mouth of the demon 
Rahu.
Free from sorrow, her weariness removed, her mental affliction alleviated, and her consciousness S
awakened with exaltation, that esteemed lady (Seetha) looked handsome with her countenance, as a night with the 
the moon appears during the bright fortnight.On hearing that great tumult of battle between demons and monkeys, Rama spoke to
Jambavan as follows:
"O excellent Jambavan! From the way in which a very great terrible rattling sound of
arms in heard, it seems an exceedingly difficult feat has been performed by Hanuma. It is
certain."
"O lord of bears! Therefore, accompanied by your own army, go and quickly extend
your help to that Hanuma, who is fighting."
Saying "Yes, so be it" and surrounded by his own army, Jambavan came to the western
gate, where the monkey, Hanuma was.
Thereupon, Jambavan saw Hanuma, coming with monkeys, who had given fight and were
sighing (on account of grief caused by the destruction of Seetha).
Seeing that terrible army of bears, looking like a dark cloud on their way, ready
(to perform battle) and effectively intercepting it, Hanuma retreated them all.
Quickly seeking the presence of Rama with that army, the highly illustrious Hanuma,
with sorrow, spoke the following words to Rama:
"While we, who were carrying on the battle, stood looking on, Indrajit, the son of
Ravana killed Seetha in front of us, even though she continued to weep."
"O destroyer of enemies! On seeing her with my distressed mind, I felt sad. I came
to report the event to you."
Hearing those words of Hanuma, Rama then was agitated with grief and fell down on
the ground, like a tree with its bottom chopped off.
On seeing that Rama, who with the semblance of god, falling on the ground, the
chiefs of monkeys came bouncing from all sides and rushed towards him.
They sprinkled him with water, fragrant with scent of lotuses and lilies, as one
would sprinkle an inextinguishable as one would sprinkle an inextinguishable fire, which has just
flared up suddenly and is burning all.
Then, the highly lamenting Lakshmana, having embraced that ailing Rama in his arms,
spoke the following meaningful words, endowed with reason:
"O venerable brother! Virtue cannot save you, who are sticking to the noble path and
who have subdued the senses, from adversities and is (hence) useless."
"Just as inanimate and animate beings are visible, likewise virtue and vice are not
visible. Therefore, my opinion is that virtue is non-existent."
"Even as inanimate beings and animate beings are expressly visible, likewise this
form of virtue of vice is not established. For, in that case, a virtuous man like you would not
have this misfortune."
"If unrighteousness had been effective, Ravana should have obtained the hell. You,
endowed with virtue, would never obtain such troubles."
"Since there is absence of calamity for Ravana and misfortune occurred to you, the
result of vice is obtained through virtue and the result of virtue is obtained through vice. The
contraries of each other have changed the roles with each other."
Will the fruit of virtue be obtained through virtue and fruit of vice through vice?
If that in whom unrighteousness is rooted are enjoined with the fruit of unrighteousness alone,
people showing interest in unrighteousness would be deprived of the fruit of virtue. The fruit of
virtue alone would have accrued to those who administer righteousness through that virtue?
Since prosperities of those, in whom unrighteousness is rooted, develop; while those
who have a conduct of virtue suffer, hence these two (virtue and vice) are useless.
"O Rama! If sinful doers are killed by their own vice, that unrighteousness, as it
does, in the act of killing, will be forthwith destroyed. Whom will that unrighteousness destroy
(which is destroyed in the course of three seconds)?"
"Or if a man is killed by a recourse to a ritual prescribed in the scriptures or
kills another (by recourse to such a ritual), that destiny alone, which is engendered by that
ritual, is tainted by that sinful act and not the agent."
"O Rama, the destroyer of adversaries! It is not clear how prosperity can be reached
by righteousness, which has never known how to retaliate. Hence, righteousness seems to be
non-existent."
"O chief among the virtuous! If righteousness were really there, no evil whatever
would have accrued to you. As you reaped such a calamity, the hypotheses that the destiny
engendered by virtuous acts is real is not proved."*
"Or else, if righteousness becomes weak and cowardly, as it surrenders to the might,
it is my opinion that the righteousness, which lacks strength and has been deprived of its
capacity, should no longer be pursued."
"Depend on might, as you do now on virtue, if the virtue is subordinate to might,
thus giving up predominance of virtue."
"O tormentator of enemies! Or else, if speaking truth were indeed a virtue, our
lying father, who was merciless to you, was disunited from you. Were you not bound by that
announcement made by our father regarding your installation as the Prince Regent?"
"O tormentator of your enemies! Had either righteousness or unrighteousness worth
pursuing, Indra the wielder of thunderbolt would not have performed a sacrifice on killing a sage
(viz. Viswarupa, son of Twasta*)
"O Rama! Virtue destroys enemies, when united with might (something other than
virtue). O Rama! A man does all this, according to his will."
"O Rama in a pitiable condition. My opinion is that righteousness consists in such
recourse to both virtue and strength. The very roots of virtue (in the form of earthly gain) have
been chopped off by you in that you spurned the sovereignty the other day."
"By the treasures brought from place to place and augmented by means of various
strategies, all the tasks are indeed fulfilled, as the rivers flow from the mountains."
"All the tasks of a man of small intellect, bereft of his wealth, get a cessation as
small rivers dry up in summer-season."
"Such a man, brought up by comforts, renouncing wealth (within easy reach) and
seeking comfort, proceeds to commit sinful act and then evil (in the form of punishment) follows
from it."
"Friends gather round him, who has riches. Relatives stand by him, who has riches.
He alone is virile in the world, who has riches. He alone is a learned man, who has riches."
"He alone is a mighty man, who has riches. He alone is a prudent man, who has
riches. He alone is highly fortunate. He alone is distinguished, who has riches."
"O resolute one! I told you about these evils attendant on the abjuration of wealth.
The ground on which you made the resolve to sacrifice the kingdom was not known to me."
"A man in whom the treasures abide, religious merit and wealth are obtained. All
would be favourable to him. To the penniless man, who has a desire for wealth and even hunting for
wealth, it is not possible to attain wealth."
"O king! Delight, sensuous pleasure, pride, virtue, anger, peace, control of the
senses all these are attained from wealth."
"Those riches, due to renunciation of which, worldly happiness of those practicing
the path of virtue gets lost, are not seen in you, any more than the planets are seen in cloudy
days."
"O valiant one! While you were in exile, faithful to the command of your father,
your wife who was more beloved than life itself, was stolen away by a demon."
"O valiant prince! I shall dispel with my exploits today, that great agony caused by
Indrajit. Therefore, rise O Rama!"
"O the foremost among men! O the long-armed one! O the firmly resolute one! Arise!
Why are you not knowing about yourself, who is the great-souled and whose spirit is
disciplined?"
"O faultless one! On seeing the death of Seetha and enraged, rising to do favour for
you, I shall completely destroy with my arrows, Lanka with its chariots, elephants and horses along
with Ravana."Thereafter at that time, Seetha a princess without any blame of excellent limbs shook like a plantain 
tree in the wind on seeing Ravana the king of rakshasas endowed with beauty and youth adorned with excellent ornaments.
The wide-eyed Seetha with excellent color covering their stomach with thighs and breasts with hands sat 
down crying.
Ravana saw Seetha protected by batches of ogres looking miserable being struck with grief like 
a ship in danger in the sea.
Hanuma saw Seetha sitting down on uncovered land, with a firm resolve, like a branch of a tree 
fallen on earth being torn from the tree.
Hanuma saw Seetha with a strange body with dirt as an ornament, who although suited to decorate with 
ornaments was without ornaments. Although She was shining like a lotus stem covered with mud, She was not shining 
also.
Seetha was as though going near to Rama a lion among kings with a famous personality with desires 
as chariot tied with thoughts as horses.
Seetha a pleasant one, was emaciated, was crying, being alone having surrendered to Her thoughts 
and sorrow not seeing the end of grief, following the will of Rama.
And also Seetha was like a great she-serpent writhing under the spell of an incantation. She was 
like Rohini being fumigated by a smoke-colored planet called Ketu.
Being born into a virtuous traditional family with good conduct and character and getting married, 
Seetha appeared as if She was born into a bad family.
Seetha was like fame fallen due to false blame. She was like education ruined due to a lack 
of learning by heart.
Seetha was like deteriorated great fame, like insulted faith, like an understanding grown feeble, 
like dulled hope.
Seetha was like an expectation destroyed, like an order flouted; like a blazing quarter during 
a period of destruction, like a worship stolen.
Seetha was like a lotus destroyed, like an army with killed warriors, like light destroyed by darkness, 
like a vanished river.
Seetha was like an altar desecrated, like a tongue of fire gone out, like a full moon night with 
moon devoured by Rahu.
Seetha was like a lotus pond agitated with turned out leaves and lotuses, being roughly treated 
by the trunk of an elephant.
Grieved for their husband, Seetha was like a river that has dried up with water caused to flow out lacking 
the best washing was like a new moon night.
Seetha was a delicate one with well-built limbs, accustomed to houses full of diamonds, being tormented 
by heat, like a lotus fiber uprooted a short time back.
Seetha was like a she-elephant captured and tied to a pillar, made to be without the leader of 
herd, sighing, very much tormented by grief.
With a long single plait, shining without effort, Seetha was like the earth with dark groups of 
trees at the end of the rainy season.
Wasted, and emaciated due to fasting, due to sorrow, due to thought, and due to fear, Seetha was with 
limited food and with austerity as wealth.
Seetha was like a celestial being, tormented by grief and by thought with joined palms, desiring 
the defeat of Ravana at the hands of Sri Rama
Ravana was trying to allure and threatening death to Seetha who was looking in every direction, 
crying, without blame, with good eyelids and reddish white eyes, with an excessive vow to follow Sri Rama.
Then, seeing Hanuma, who was tawny coloured like a series of flashing thunderbolts wrapped up in 
a white cloth and hiding behind the branches of a tree, Seetha had her mind shaken.
Seetha beheld there a monkey, beaming like a cluster of Ashoka flowers wide opened, with his eyes 
resembling regined gold, humble and speaking agreeable words.
Seetha got a great surprise and thought (as follows): "Alas! This monkey is hard to be approached, 
fearful and difficult to be looked at." Thus thinking, she was bewildered again.
The splendid woman Seetha, bewildered by fear and afflicted with grief, lamented most piteously 
saying "O, Rama! O, Rama! and "O Lakshmana!". Seetha wept faintly in a low voice in many ways.
Seeing that excellent monkey appraching humbly, that splendid woman Seetha thought it as a dream.
Seetha, looking hither and thither, saw Hanuman, who was having a wide and curved mouth, doing 
acts as told by sugreeva the king of monkeys, the foremost of monkeys, greatly adored and the best among the inelligent.
As soon as seeing Hanuma Seetha lost her consciousness very much and became seemingly lifeless. 
Regaining her consciousness after a long time the wide eyed Seetha moreover thought (as follows)
"Today, I saw an ugly monkey in my dream, which is forbidden according to a body of scriptures. 
May it be well with Rama together with Lakshmana and with my father, King Janaka.
"This is not a dream. To me, tormented by sorrow and grief, there is indeed no sleep. To me, separated 
from Rama whose countenance resembles a full moon, there is no happiness indeed!"
"Since I am pondering with my mind about that Rama only, and always saying 'Rama! Rama!' thus, 
confomably I am seeing and hearing a story thus corresponding to he same thought."
"Tormented as I am today by manmatha god of love longing for Rama, my whole feelings directed towards 
him and constantly thinking of him alone, in the like manner I am seeing him and in the like manner i am hearing 
of him alone."
"I am imagining that my wish will be fulfilled. Likewise, I am reasoning my wish by my intellect 
also. There is no concrete form indeed for my wish. He, with a well manifested form is speaking to me. for what 
reason?"
"My salutation to Brihaspati the Lord of eloquence, together with Indra the wielder of a thunderbolt, 
to Brahma the self-existent Lord and to the Lord of Fire eating the oblations! Let whatever words spoken by this 
monkey be true! Let them not be untrue!"This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. 
The sublimity of Seetha's characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether 
Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature 
as to 'why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some 
rains and go...' If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against 
her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called 
a woman who isbhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi'blinded by the devotement to her 
husband...' 'a desirer of her husband's welfare...' even at her own risk.
This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It israama ayanaand becomesraamaayaNawhen 
compounded. Againraamais not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is alsoraamaaas 
said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. , th verse:
Thus this epic is calledraamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam'the peregrination of Seetha and 
Rama...' where the first wordraamaawith elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the 
secondraamawith shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination 
of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, 
and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation 
occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, 
good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that 
of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no 
oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote.
On identifying the grievous voice that is identifiable with her husband's voice, Seetha spoke to Lakshmana, 
"you go at once, and check up on Raghava.' 
"I have heard the loud yelling voice of highly fretful Rama whereby my heart, or my very entity, is 
not abiding in its place, and it will be apt of you to protect such a brother of yours who is screaming 
in the forest. 
"He might have come under the subjugation of demons as with a bull coming under the seize of lions, 
hence, you hurry up so as to near such a brother of yours who is seeking protection." So said Seetha 
toi Lakshmana. 
Although she spoke a lot to him in this way, Lakshmana on his part has not moved out remembering his 
brother's order to stay guard to Seetha, and hence that Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, who is already 
agitated for Rama further spoke to him in the paradox of his not going out of hermitage. 
"You are like a foe of your brother in friend's mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards 
a brother even if he is in an emergency. 
"Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you 
are not following up on Raghava. It is definite. 
" 'Raghava in direst strait' is the most liked thing to you, thus I deem, as you have no heart for that 
brother, and as you complacently stay behind even when that great-resplendent Rama is unseen. 
"After which helmsman you have come here that Rama is undergoing an uncertainty of life-and-death, as 
such I indeed wonder what business you have here now in staying with me at this hermitage?" Seetha spoke 
so to Lakshmana. 
Lakshmana spoke to Seetha, the princess from Videha kingdom, who is talking deluged under tears and 
anguish in that way, as she is fretful like a she-deer. 
"Oh, Vaidehi, your husband is an impossible one for vincibility by serpents, asura-s, gandharva-s, gods, 
fiends, demons, no doubt about it.
"Oh, auspicious one, unmarked is some combatant who can counterattack Rama from among gods, humans, 
gandharva-s, birds, ogres, kinnaraa-s, beasts, or oh, lady, even from horrendous demons, as Rama vies 
with Indra in any given war. 
"It is inapt of you to talk that way as Rama is inextirpable in a given war, and as for me, I do not 
venture to abandon you in this forest in the absence of Raghava. 
"Let the most forceful Crowns with all their military forces, or, all of the gods together with their 
heads, why they, let all the three worlds put together come mutinously, whether jointly or severally, 
Rama's prowess is irrestrainable. 
"Hence, let your heart be diverted and anxiety divested, as your husband will be returning soon on killing 
that extraordinary deer. 
"Evidently it is not the voice of Rama, nor that of any other god, but someone mimicked that voice for 
chicanery, and that must be the illusory voice of that demon Maareecha, similar in effect to the magical 
city of gandharva-s usually created by magicians in general. 
"And you are an entrustment, oh, best lady Vaidehi, as the great-souled Rama has entrusted you in my 
security, as such I do not dare to leave you off now. 
"Oh, gracious lady, we have become the adversaries of these night-walkers insofar as the elimination 
of Khara and others, and concerning the eradication of Janasthaana. 
"The demons are the swaggerers in violence in great forests and they will be employing various voices. 
Therefore Vaidehi, just do not bother about it." Thus Lakshmana advised Seetha. 
As for Seetha, she became furious on hearing Lakshmana's words of advice, and while her eyes are becoming 
bloodshot she spoke these rude sentences to that veracious Lakshmana. 
"You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem 
that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama. 
"You are haranguing all these sermons only on noticing hardship to Rama. It is unsurprising that the 
pitiless ones and rivals of your kind, who always behave in a cloak-and dagger way, will tend to commit 
deadly sins, Lakshmana, and it is not uncommon. 
"You are verily maleficent for you have singly and covertly followed Rama, who started to forests all 
alone, or instigated by Bharata, only because of me. 
"Whether this is an intrigue of yours or that of Bharata it is unachievable, Saumitri. How can I long 
for another commoner when I have put my faith only in the lotus-blue-complexioned and lotus-bright-eyed 
husband of mine, Rama? 
"If that comes to that, I will just discard my life in your presence, Soumitri do not mistake it. I 
do not eke out an existence on this earth even for a moment without Rama." Thus Seetha threatened Lakshmana. 

When that self-mortified Lakshmana is addressed in this way with hair-raising and acerbic words by Seetha, 
he spoke to her suppliantly adjoining his palm-fold. 
"I do not venture to reply you Maithili, as you are like a deity to me. Women using words that are in 
a class by themselves is not at all surprising. This sort of bringing stilted words into play is the 
nature of women and it is obvious in the world. 
"Women by their nature are unbound by the etiquette of decency, whimsical, cantankerous and they tend 
to become the artificers of vicissitudes, and oh, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka, indeed unbearable 
are this kind of words that are much the same as burnt iron arrows thrust in between my two ears. 
"Let all of the forest-itinerants indeed listen as to how you are addressing me with bitter words, though 
I am reasoning with you conscientiously, and let them become my corroborators for the sake of justice. 

"Fie upon you, you are acrimoniously tempered owing to your faminality, and by which impulsive reason 
you mistrust me who am presently abiding in my brother's order, may God damn you for that crotchety. 

"I am going there where Rama is, oh, lady with best visage, you be blest, and oh, broad-eyed one, let 
all of the forest deities protect you. 
"Gauging by those dangerous forebodings that are now bidding fair, can I to see you again along with 
Rama on my return, or not? That I do not know." Thus Lakshmana spoke to Seetha. 
When Lakshmana spoke to that wailful daughter of Janaka, she on her part spoke this curt sentence to 
him, while tears whelmed her to a fault. 
"Without Rama I plunge myself in River Godavari, or else I string up myself, or discard this body of 
mine from heights..." Thus Seetha started to vent out her feelings. 
"I drink deadly poison, or I enter a flaring fire, but I will never touch another man other than Raghava. 

Seetha on declaring to Lakshmana in this way, she who is anguished and weeping bitterly, then started 
to smite her belly with both of her palms in a heightened agony. 
Observing the agonised aspect of Seetha that cheerless Saumitri started to cheer her up by repeatedly 
informing that her husband Rama will come soon. Even then Seetha has not spoken in the least to the 
brother of her husband, and maintained a silence of antipathy. 
But then, holding Seetha in usual reverence that self-respectful Lakshmana briefly came to her fore 
making a reverential palm-fold that briefly, and then he proceeded to the proximity of Rama, while repeatedly 
looking back at that lonely lady in the thick of forest. That Seetha, hearing those unpleasant words of Ravana, tormented by grief, was frightened like 
a tiny female elephant overpowered by a lion in the middle of a forest.
That fearful Seetha, who was situated in the middle of female demons and also threatened by Ravana 
with his words galore, lamented (as follows) like a young virgin who was left lonely amid a forest.
"Truly the saints affirm that untimely death does not come in the world, as I being impure am surviving 
even for an instant, though being threatened in this way."
"Though devoid of happiness and frequently full of sorrow, my heart must be hard indeed, in that 
it does not break into a thousand pieces today like a mountain-top struck by lightning."
"There is no fault of mine in this matter. I have become killable at the hands of this demon of 
disagreeable perception. I am not able to give him my affection any more than a member of the twice-born classes 
would offer a mystical verse to one not belonging to the twice-born classes."
"If Rama the Ruler of the world does not come here, the evil Ravana, the king of Demons will cut 
off my limbs with his sharpened weapons, even as a surgeon would cut the limbs of a lifeless fetus."
"To me lamenting, two months will go up to a long time, as at the end of a night a thief imprisoned 
and to be capitally punished under the detention orders of a king. Alas! This is painful."
"O Rama, O Lakshmana, O Sumitra, O Kausalya! O mother! I, of a scanty fortune, am going to be destroyed, 
like a ship driven out of its course by a strong wind in a mighty ocean."
"In the disguise of a deer, those two energetic sons of Dasaratha were surely killed for my sake, 
as two excellent lions killed by a flashing thunderbolt."
"Certainly that Time-spirit, assuming the guise of a deer, allured me, a woman of poor fortune 
at that time and to whom I, a stupid woman, sent forth (far away) Lakshmana and the noble prince Rama the elder 
brother of Lakshmana."
"O Rama, the strictly truthful man and the long-armed, O the man whose face resembles the full moon! 
You, who are well-disposed of the world of living beings, do not indeed know me to have been sentenced to death 
by the demons."
"My not having a deity (other than my husband), this patience, my reposing on the floor, my restriction 
in righteousness, my devotion to the husband - all this has become a waste, like a good act done by men to ungrateful 
men becoming waste".
"For me who is not seeing you, who is bereft of you, who is not hopeful of coming into contact 
with you, who is emaciated and pale in complexion this righteous act performed by me has indeed become a waste. 
Likewise, this state of my being only one wife to you has become useless.."
"Having fulfilled your father's command as per the order of his words and observed your vow, you 
return from the forest fearlessly and having accomplished your purpose, I think you will enjoy carnally with large-eyed 
women."
"O Rama! Having performed austerity and vow in vain, I for myself who has fallen in love with you 
and in whose was confined an affection for you for a long time, for my destruction, I can lose my life. Woe 
to me of my little fortune!"
"I as such will abandon quickly my life by poison or by a sharp weapon. To me, none is there, who 
is a giver either of a poison or of a sharp weapon in the house of Ravana."
Thus lamenting in several ways, Seetha was recollecting Rama in all spirits and trembling with 
and emaciated face approached that excellent tree in bloom.
Seetha, who was tormented with grief, though in various ways and thereafter held her 
braid of hair looking like a hanging rope (now thought within herself) "I shall go to the presence of Yama the 
God of Death by tying my neck quickly with my braid of hair looking like a hanging rope"
Thereafter Seetha with all her soft limbs stood seizing a branch of that tree. To her having a handsome 
limbs, who were thinking of Rama, Lakshmana, and her race, then appeared many omens, which did not have adequate 
occasion for grief, which procured courage in the world, which were excellent and which were seen earlier also 
as thoroughly efficacious.She that Vaidehi who is haggard by anguish boldly spoke to Ravana when he addressed her in that way, 
duly placing a blade of straw in between herself and Ravana. 
"He whose son is Raghava, is a resolute king known as Dasharatha. That king is a kingly rampart for 
righteousness, a kingpin abiding in forthrightness and thereby his kingliness is well renowned in all 
worlds, and my husband Rama is such a king's son. 
"Such a Dasharatha's son who is virtue-souled one, who is highly renowned in all the three worlds for 
his ambidexterity and perspicacity, and who is known as Rama is my husband and a god to me. 
"He who took birth in Ikshvaku's dynasty is a great-resplendent one with his shoulders like those of 
a lion, and who comes here along with similarly lion-shouldered and nearly great-resplendent brother 
of his, namely Lakshmana, to take your lives away. Such Rama is my husband. 
"Had I been forcibly humiliated by you in the presence of Rama, you too would have been killed by Rama 
in combat and by now you too would be sprawling on earth, as with Khara in Janasthaana, but you foxed 
him. However, such Rama is my husband. 
"Those demons who are spoken of you to be with ghastly forms and gruelling power, they all will become 
formless and powerless in face of Raghava, as with all snakes becoming non-poisonous earthworms in the 
face of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. Such Rama is my husband. 
"Those gilded arrows of Rama unloosened directly and unswervingly from his bowstring will utterly batter 
your body, as the waves of River Ganga will be battering that river's riverbanks. Such Rama is my husband. 

"Even if you are unkillable either by gods or by demons, you Ravana, you will not be disenthralled by 
Rama while you are alive, for you hatched a very great animosity in him against you. 
"That mighty Rama will become the terminator of the vestige of your life, and as with an animal fastened 
to the stake of sacrifice your life too will become irretrievable. 
"If he that Rama glances you with his rancour-torched eyes, you demon, you will be completely burnt 
down now itself, as with Love-god burnt down by Furious Shiva. 
"He that Rama who hurls down the moon from skies onto earth, or else extirpates it if need be, or even 
desiccates an ocean, he alone rescues Seetha from here. 
"Gone is your liveability, gone is your prosperity, gone is your vivacity, and gone is your faculty. 
Thus Lanka is widowed by a single deed of yours. 
"In forest you have separated me from the propinquity of my husband, which diabolic deed of yours will 
not result in any ultimate happiness for you. 
"In fact, that great-resplendent husband of mine, Rama, is still residing in the eremitical Dandaka 
forest, bravely hinging on to his own valour, in tandem only with my brother-in-law. 
"With storms of his arrows in a given combat my husband will dislodge arrogance, insolence, puissance, 
like that impudence from every limb of yours. 
"As and when ruination of created beings manifests actuated by Time, then all of them will place their 
behaviour in endangerment, as they have gone under the control of End-Time. 
"This is that time which has bechanced on you owing to your molesting me, you basely demon, by which 
time-factor yourself, all of your demons, and even all of your queens in the Chambers of Queens will 
be devastated. 
"It is impossible for a profaner to heavily tread on the Altar of Fire amidst a Ritual Hall surrounded 
by oblational vessels, further sanctified by Vedic hymns. 
"Likewise, I am the solemnly pledged legitimate wife of one who steadied himself in righteousness, and 
such as I am, you basely demon, it is impossible for you trespasser to touch me even. 
"How a she-swan ever frolicking with majestic swans in bunches of lotuses can leer at a water-crow sneaking 
in a bunch of grass? 
"Oh, demon, you may either trammel or vandalise this inertial body of mine. I claim neither this body 
nor life of mine as my own. But I am intolerant to bear with any disrepute on this earth." Thus Seetha 
castigated Ravana. 
Vaidehi on speaking those highly caustic words angrily to Ravana in this way, she that Maithili spoke 
no more in that matter. 
On hearing Seetha's scathing and hair-raising censures, then Ravana retorted with these intimidatory 
chides. 
"Oh, angry lady Maithili, listen to my words. A period of twelve months is given to you. And oh, smiley 
smiler, if you do not come nigh of me within that period, then the cooks will slice you to pieces for 
the purpose of a morning meal." 
Thus on saying those harsh words, Ravana, the one who makes his enemies to bewail, and who is now infuriated 
said this sentence to the guarding demonesses. 
"Oh, gnarled demonesses of grisly mien and devourers of meat and blood, you have to indeed remove her 
pride immediately. 
Just by that order of Ravana those demonesses of grotesque and ugly appearance have obediently made 
palm-fold to him and encircled Maithili. 
That king Ravana paced in an earth-shattering manner as though to cleave it and clearly said this to 
those demonesses with ghastly look. 
"Let this Maithili be taken to the centre of Ashoka gardens, where you all shall blockade and guard 
her stealthily. 
"You threaten her with dreadful admonitions and again speaking imploringly you all have to bring her 
under control, as a wild she-elephant of age will be brought under control. 
When Ravana has clearly ordered, those demonesses on their part took Maithili to Ashoka garden. That 
Ashoka gardens are surrounded with trees that yield fruits to every savour, and now they are diversely 
flowered and fruited. Further, those gardens are highly adored by all-time lusty birds. 
But she that Janaka's daughter Maithili whose body is with a coverall of anguish, further on obtaining 
the control of demonesses, she is as good as a she-deer under the coverall of tigresses. 
Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, who is already consumed by utmost agony has not obtained any placidity 
now as with a she-deer bound by tether - where timorousness is common to both. 
Maithili knows no peace when the bizarre-eyed demonesses have highly intimidated her, and by shut-seeing 
those demonesses her reminiscences went over to her dear husband and about her brother-in-law Lakshmana 
too, and when she felt about the improbability of their coming here, she is distraught with alarm and 
anguish, and then she swooned. Seetha saw the illusory head and bow. She heard Ravana narrating about Rama's friendly 
relationship with Sugreeva, as earlier apprised by Hanuman. Recognizing that head as that of Rama, with 
a proof resembling her husband's eyes, facial complexion, hair, expanse of his forehead and the beautiful 
jewel worn on the top of his head, she was very much afflicted with sorrow, cried like an osprey and 
abused Kaikeyi who was the originator of the present calamity (as follows):
Kaikeyi! Be a fulfiller of your craving! This Rama, causing a joy to the family, has 
been slain. The entire race has been destroyed by a woman of squabbling nature.
"You gave clothes made of bark to the venerable Rama and sent him on exile to the forest 
along with me. What harm has he done to you?"
Thus speaking, Seetha the miserable girl was trembling and fell on the ground like a 
plantain tree that was cut off. Thus speaking, Seetha the miserable girl was trembling and fell on the 
ground like a plantain tree that was cut off.
The wide eyed Seetha thereafter was consoled in a moment, regained consciousness, approached 
near that illusory head and lamented as follows:
"O, the long armed Rama! The pursuer of a strong will! Alas, you have been killed! I 
have become a witness to your last fate. I have been made a widow."
"It is said that the early death of a husband is the misfortune of a wife. You, having 
good conduct, have preceded me in death."
"Even you who were actually intent on protecting me, fallen in great affliction and immersed 
in an ocean of grief, have been killed by the enemies"
"O, Rama! My mother- in-law Kausalya who cherished you tenderly has been left without 
a son and resembles a cow that has lost its calf."
"O, Rama! It was mentioned even by astrologers that your life span is lengthy. O, Rama! 
Their words are wrong. You are short lived."
"Otherwise, your prudence might have disappeared even though you were sagacious, for, 
Time the master of all beings has brought you to an end."
"How is it possible that you, who knew the doctrine of political ethics obtained an unforeseen 
death? You, who knew the science of expediency, were indeed skilled in warding off calamities"
"O, Rama, the lotus eyed! The night of destroying time which was very much cruel and 
terrible thus has encircled you, embezzled you and snatched you away from me."
"O, the mighty armed! O, the best of men! Leaving the miserable me, you lied down here, 
embracing the earth as your beloved"
"O, valiant Rama! Here is your bow which was decorated with gold, dear to me and worshipped 
diligently by you with sandal paste and wreath of flowers."
"O, the faultless Rama! Surely, you must have met in heaven your father and my father-in- 
law Dasaratha as well as all the multitude of manes."
"You have abandoned your own pious lineage of royal sages but whereas you performed a 
great act, which illuminated the heaven like a luminary."
"O, prince! Why don't you look at me? Why don't you reply me, a wife who lived with you 
together since the time of obtaining me as a girl by you as a boy."
"O, Rama! Remember your solemn promise at the time of our marriage, saying I shall have 
righteous conduct with you' Take me also with you, wretched as I Am."
"O, Rama the best of beings! Why have you gone away, quitting me like this? Leaving me, 
the miserable woman, why have you gone to the other world from this world?"
"That beautiful body, which was cuddled by me with divine essences, is now being dragged 
about by wild beasts."
"Why are you not securing the privilege of being cremated with a sacrificial fire, even 
though you have worshipped the Lord through sacrificial performances such as Agnishtoma, duly furnished 
with abundant gifts?".
"Kausalya absorbed as she was with grief can only see Lakshmana alone returned out of 
the three who attained exile."
"He will narrate surely to her when enquired, about your slaughter as also the killing 
of the army of your alley, by demons at night."
"O, Rama! Hearing that you were killed while sleeping and that I was kept in the house 
of ogres, she will be no more, as her heart will be broken."
"The strong and faultless prince Rama was killed in a small puddle, after crossing the 
ocean, for the cause of me, an unworthy woman."
"I, the obloquy of my race, was wedded by Rama due to ignorance. Thus, a wife herself 
has eventually proved to be the cause for death of Rama, an honorable man."
"Even though I was a wife of Rama who showed hospitality to all the guests, it is I, 
that very person, who is weeping here and now, because without doubt, in a previous existence, an excellent 
gift was refused by me (to an eligible person)."
"Unite the wife with the husband and without delay, arrange to kill me right at the head 
of Rama. Thus, you will perform an admirable and auspicious act."
"O, Ravana! Join my head with his head and my body with his body. I shall go along the 
path of my magnanimous Lord."
The wide-eyed Sita, seeing her husband's head and bow there again and again, was tormented 
with grief and lamented as aforesaid.
While Seetha was lamenting thus, a demon who was a royal guard approached his Lord there 
with his joined palms in salutation (and cried as follows):
"May you be victorious, O noble Lord!" he respectfully announced thus, thereby winning 
his pleasure and informed that Prahasta the army chief had come.
"O, Lord! Prahasta has come with all ministers. He has sent me, eager as he is, to see 
you."
"O, king, endowed with patience! There is a little urgent work by way of king's duty. 
Please accord them your audience now."
Hearing the aforesaid communication of the demon, Ravana left the garden of Ashoka and 
bestowed audience to his ministers.
He deliberated with his ministers as to what action in its entirety to be pursued and 
entered the council-chamber and issued his commands in accordance with the knowledge he possessed of 
Rama's forces.
Soon after the departure of Ravana, the illusory head and bow had vanished.
Then, Ravana the king of demons in consultation with his highly powerful ministers, decided 
on the measures he would adopt against Rama.
Ravana the king of demons, resembling Yama the god of death, addressed all the generals 
standing nearby, devoted to his interests as follows:
"By a sound of a drum beaten audibly with a drum stick, immediately summon all my forces. 
Do not tell them the reason for which I am calling."
Then, the messengers answered, "So be it" obedient as they were to his words and instantly 
gathered a huge army together and informed their lord longing for fight, that they had since assembled 
the army.Hearing that great story, Anasuya the knower of piety kissed Seetha's forehead and hugged her in her arms.
"It was narrated sweetly and amazingly by you, in clear words and syllables. It has been indeed heard by me how all that Svayamvara, the process of self-choosing marriage took place.
O, the sweet speaking Seetha! I am overjoyed by hearing your story."
"O, Fortunate One! While the auspicious night drawing near, the sun has sunk below horizon. The twittering of the birds can be heard, who, through the day, have sought their nourishment far and wide and are seeking their shelter for sleep at the time of evening-twilight."
"These ascetics too are returning together, their bark-robes drenched from bathing, and with uplifted vessels, wet with sprinkled water on them."
"From the sacred fire kindled by the sages, according to the scriptural ordinance, a column of smoke with the hue of a Pigeon's neck, raised by the wind, is seen there."
"Thought their foliage is sparse, the trees look dense all around. The quarters of the world, by whom the senses are drawn apart, do not shine brilliantly at this place."
"The animals who wander about at night are ranging everywhere. The deer of the
hermitage are sleeping round the sacred altars."
"O, Seetha! The night richly adorned with stars has set well in motion. The moon
encircled with light is seen rising in the sky."
"Go now. I give you leave. Be a female companion to Rama. Your sweet conversation
has charmed me."
"O, Seetha! O, Dear child! Adorn (with ornaments and apparel gifted by me_ before my eyes and cause delight to me in embellishing yourself with heavenly jewels."
Then Seetha, adorning herself, resembled the daughter of a god, and making obeisance to the feet of Anasuya, she went forward to meet Rama.
Rama, the most eloquent one, saw Seetha adorned as aforesaid and felt delighted over the charming gifts of the ascetic.
Seetha, the daughter of Mithila kingdom then showed to Rama all the apparel, jewels and garlands the affectionate gifts of Anasuya the hermitess.
Seeing the respectful treatment, received by Seetha, which was very rare among human beings, Rama and Lakshmana the great car-warrior felt highly rejoiced.
Thereupon, Rama with his face resembling the moon, having been honoured by the holy ascetics, was delighted and spent that auspicious night there.
While that night passed away, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men finished their ablutions and took leave of the ascetics dwelling the forest, who had just poured oblations into the sacred fire.
Those ascetics dwelling in the forest and practising virtue told Rama and Lakshmana about the region of that forest, which was infested with demons (as follows):
"O, Rama! Various forms of man-eating demons and beasts drinking the blood are
living in this great forest."
"O, Rama! They devour an ascetic or a celibate, who has not rinsed his mouth after finishing his meal or who is inattentive in this great forest. (Pray ward them off!"
"O, Rama! Here is the path of the great sages, through which they fetch the fruits in this forest. It is appropriate for you to go by this path in this dangerous forest."
Thus addressed by those Brahmanas having great asceticism, who, with joined palms
paid obedience to him and blessed his journey, Rama the harasser of his foes entered the forest with his consort along with Lakshmana, as sun enters a mass of clouds.Hearing Hanuma's words, Seetha whose face resembled the full moon, spoke the following 
words braced with justice and utility, to Hanuma.
"O Hanuma! The words spoken by you viz. that Rama is not having any other thoughts (than 
on me) and is fully overwhelmed by sorrow are like ambrosia mixed with poisons."
"Destiny drags out a man into a very extensive fortune or a very dreadful adversity, 
as if being dragged, tied with ropes."
"O Hanuma the best of monkeys! For living beings, destiny is surely irresistible. See 
how Lakshmana, myself, and Rama are baffled by misfortunes."
"When will Rama reach the end of this grief any more than a thoroughly fatigued man, 
having suffered a shipwreck is swimming in the middle of the sea?"
"When will my husband see me, after the annihilation of the demons, killing of Ravana and 
making the City of Lanka debacle?."
"Till the current period of one year is not completed, that Rama is to be told to make 
haste to save me; since my life will be lasting till such time only."
"O Hanuma! Out of the time limit given to me by the cruel Ravana for my survival, the 
tenth month is now running. Only two months are left out."
"Even when humbly entreated with continued exertion by Vibhishana his brother about my 
restoration (to Rama), Ravana is not making up his mind to do so."
"My restoration is not agreeable to Ravana. In the battle, death lies in wait for Ravana, 
who has become subject to the power of Time."
"O Hanuma! Nala, the eldest maiden daughter of Vibhishana, when she was sent personally 
to me by her mother, told me about this."
"O Hanuma the excellent of monkeys! Rama, my husband, will soon regain me without any 
doubt. Because my heart is pure and in Rama also, many good qualities are existing."
"O Hanuma! In Rama are figured, perseverance, manliness, courage, non-mischievousness, 
gratitude, prowess and energy."
"Which Rama, who without the help of Lakshmana his brother, killed fourteen thousand 
demos in Janasthana (part of the forest), what adversary will not have fear of such a man?"
"Rama, the excellent among men, is not compelled to be moved by troubles. I now well 
the energy of Rama, as Shachi the wife of Indra knows the energy of Indra the Lord of celestials."
"O Hanuma! The powerful Rama like the sun, with his multitude of ray-like arrows, will 
dry up the water in the form of hostile adversaries."
Hanuma spoke the following words to Seetha, who was thus talking with grief for Rama 
and with her eyes full of tears."
"Soon after hearing my words, Rama will soon come, engaging a great army comprised of 
a multitude of monkeys and bears with him."
"O Seetha with a charming face! Or rather, I shall relieve you from this grief now itself. 
O irreproachable lady! Ascend my back. I shall take you to Rama."
"I shall cause you to sit on my back and cross the ocean. I have indeed the capacity to carry 
even Lanka together with Ravana."
"O Seetha! Now itself, I shall cause you to reach Rama who is staying at Prasravana Mountain, 
even as fire-god hands over the oblations offered in the sacrifices to Indra the Lord of celestials."
"O Seetha! Now, you can see Rama together with Lakshmana, getting ready for a 
the strenuous effort to annihilate the demons, as Vishnu the Lord of Preservation gets ready to killing 
of demons."
"The mighty Rama, with gusto to see you, is staying in a hermitage, even as Indra the 
destroyer of strong-holds sitting on the back of Airavata the elephant."
"O Seetha the auspicious princess! Mount on my back. Do not have any hesitation. Be inclined 
of joining Rama even as Rohini, moon's favorite wife, joined the moon."
"You ascend my back and cross the ocean by journeying through the sky, as though speaking 
to the greatly resplendent sun and the moon."
"O Seetha! While I am taking you from here, nobody staying in Lanka is competent to 
come along with me."
"O Seetha! In what manner I reached here, in the same manner, I shall move through the 
sky, taking you along with me. See, there is no doubt."
Hearing those astonishing words from Hanuma, Seetha with her entire limbs flowered with 
joy, thereafter spoke to Hanuma (as follows):
"O Hanuma! How are you wishing to carry me for such a long distance? O chief of monkeys! 
I consider this indeed as your apishness!"
"O Hanuma the best of monkeys! With such a small sized body, how do you wish to take 
me from here to the presence of my husband, Rama the Lord of human beings?"
Hearing the words of Seetha, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought it to 
be the first insult was caused to him.
(Hanuma said to himself); "The black-eyed Seetha is not aware of my strength or power. 
That is why, let her see the form I can assume at will."
Hanuma, the best of monkeys and the annihilator of enemies thinking in this way, then 
showed his peculiarity to Seetha.
Hanuma, the intelligent and excellent of monkeys leaped down from that tree and 
then, to create confidence in Seetha started to increase his body form.
Hanuma, the foremost of monkeys, flashed like Meru and Mandara mountains, shining brightly 
like a blazing fire. He thus stood too in front of Seetha.
The mighty Hanuma, resembling a mountain, has a red face, teeth, and nails as 
hard as adamant and terrific in appearance, and spoke the following words to Seetha.
"To me, there is the capability to carry this Lanka along with its hills, forest areas, market-places, 
defensive walls, and arches together with its Lord Ravana himself."
"O princess! For this reason, leave your suspicion and keep your mind steady. Come along 
with me and make Rama and Lakshmana bereft of grief."
Seetha, with her large eyes resembling lotus petals, spoke to that terrific Hanuma, the 
son of wind-god (as follows)
"O great monkey! I know fully well your courage, strength, your power of movement like 
that of the wind and your wonderful brilliance like that of the fire."
"O the best of monkeys! How can any other common person cross this unfathomable ocean 
and reach this place?"
"I know your capacity of carrying and taking me from here. However, we have to determine 
soon whether the accomplishment of work by the high souled Rama would not thus get spoiled."
"O the faultless one! Oh, the excellent of monkeys! It is not befitting of me to go with 
you. For, your speed resembling the winds speed, may bewilder my mind."
"Reaching the sky high above the sea, I will fall out of fear from your back even 
as you sweep with speed."
"Having fallen insensible into the sea, which is filled with sharks, crocodiles, and giant 
fish, I may become the best food soon for the aquatic creatures."
"O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! I can't go with you. There 
will also be a risk for you, having me a lady additionally to protect. There is no doubt."
"Seeing me being taken away by you, the demons of terrific prowess, incited by the evil-minded 
Ravana will follow you."
"O brave monkey! Those valiant demons wielding darts and clubs in their hands will surround 
you. Accompanied by a lady in me, you will be at a risk."
"Many demons will come with their weapons, in the sky. You will be alone without any 
weapon. How can you continue your travel, while protecting me?"
"O the best of monkeys! While you will be resorting to battle with those demons, who 
perform cruel acts, I, stricken with fear, may fall from your back."
"O excellent of monkeys! Then the powerful and terrific demons with their giant bodies 
will conquer you in battle, somehow or other."
"Otherwise, if you are indifferent to me and resort to battle, I may eventually fall 
. Then, the wicked demons, catching hold of me fallen, may take me again to Lanka."
"Or they may take me away from your hand, or may even kill me. In battle, victory and 
defeat are perceived as uncertain."
"O the best of monkeys! Or while I am frightened by the demons, I may get into a mishap. 
Thus, your effort may become futile indeed!"
"You may be surely able to kill all the demons. But if you alone kill all the demons, 
Rama's celebrity will be lowered."
"Otherwise, the demons may take me away and hide me in any secret place that will not 
be known by those monkeys or even Rama and Lakshmana."
"Then your effort taken for my sake will become futile. That is why there is a great 
merit in Rama's coming here along with you."
"O Hanuma the long-armed! The survival of the high souled Rama, his brothers, of yourself 
and of your royal family (of Sugreeva) is dependent on me."
"Those two men Rama and Lakshmana who are emaciated by grief and anguish along with all 
bears and monkeys, losing their hope, will abandon their lives."
"O Hanuma, the best of monkeys! Honoring the devotion to my husband, I cannot touch 
the body of any man other than that of Rama."
"That I got, by force, the touch of Ravana's body, was because being helpless, having 
lost control of myself and without a protector, I could not do anything."
"If Rama kills Ravana here along with his relatives and departs taking me from here, 
it would be proper for him"
"I have not only heard but seen myself about the strength of the high souled Rama destroying 
enemies in battle. Neither the celestials nor the divine musicians nor the serpent-gods nor the demons 
are equal to Rama in combat."
"Who can withstand seeing in a battle that mighty Rama, dazzling like a fire fanned by the wind, 
wielding his conspicuous bow and having prowess equal to that of Indra the Lord of celestials, together 
with Lakshmana?"
"O the best of monkeys! In battle, who can endure Rama resembling the sun at noon-time, 
with his arrows resembling its rays, the destroyer in battle, stationed like a mythical elephant in 
rut, along with Lakshmana?
"O the excellent of monkeys! You, as such, soon bring my husband here along with Lakshmana, 
and the chiefs of the army. Oh, the best of monkeys! I have been emaciated with grief about Rama for a long. Make 
me now joyful."On hearing Seetha's words that valorous ten-headed Ravana loudly clapped in dissent for once and divulged 
his very mighty body. 
That wordsmith Ravana again spoke these words to Maithili, "Perhaps you have not heard about my valour 
and vanquishes in all your madness for Rama. 
"Standing on the sky I can lift up the earth with two of my arms, I can completely gulp down any ocean, 
standing in war I can even put the Death to death. 
"Indeed, I can split the Sun and splinter the earth with my splitting arrows, oh, mad woman, I can assume 
any form as I wish, and endow any wish you wish, such as I am, I must be your husband, behold me." So 
said Ravana when revealing his real nature. 
While the infuriated Ravana is saying in that way his eyes which by themselves are torchlit in their 
shine have became further bloodshot and blackened at their edges. 
Immediately discarding the gentle form of a Brahman friar, that younger brother of Kubera, Ravana, assumed 
his own ferocious form which is similar to the form of Terminator. 
That celebrated Ravana whose eyes are bloodshot as he is ensorcelled by desperate fury transmuted his 
form into a tend-faced, twenty-armed night-walker wearing golden ornaments of purified gold and appearing 
as a black tempestuous cloud. 
On discarding that guise of a Brahman friar that sovereign of demons Ravana educed his own physique 
and then that mighty bodied one attired in reddish clothing stood before Maithili observing that gem 
of a lady. 
She whose tresses are glossily blackish until their ends, and who has on her glittering jewellery and 
silken-ochry-sari, whereby who is imperceivable like sun's glaring shine, to such Maithili Ravana spoke. 

"If you wish to have a husband of well-renown in three worlds you seek shelter in me, oh, high-hipped 
lady, I alone will match up to you as husband. 
"Ultimately you have a much-lauded husband in me, as such you oblige me, and I will not cause any displeasure 
to you at any point of time. Let your heart refrain from that humanly Rama and you start bringing round 
your heart towards me. 
"Oh, halfwitted lady, you who deem yourself a highly intellectual lady, listen, that mindless Rama who 
just by a word of a woman forebode kingdom along with all of his amiable people, and lives in this forest 
where the predators are on the prowl, thus he who is spurned off from kingdom, ungainful are his purposes, 
and who is even a short-lived human, I wonder by what merits you are impassioned for such a Rama?" Thus 
Ravana spoke to Seetha. 
On saying that sentence to Maithili, who by herself is a nice talker and who is a proper one for addressing 
with nice words, that verily evil-minded demon Ravana maddened by lust drew nigh of Seetha and grabbed 
her, as Budha, the Jupiter grabs the Star Rohini in firmament. 
He that Ravana grabbed the lotus-eyed Seetha on lifting her up with his left hand at her plait of hair 
at nape, and with his right hand at her thighs. 
On seeing him who grabbed Seetha, who has incisive fangs, mightily armed and who is shining forth like 
a mountain crest and similar to Death, the forest deities quickly fled away terrorised by his terrorism. 

Then the miracle-air-chariot of Ravana which is miraculously designed to appear and disappear at the 
wish of its master, yoked with miraculous mules, and built with its golden wheels and parts, appeared 
afore Ravana braying noisily. 
Then he whose voice is strident that Ravana lifted her up by her waist and got Vaidehi up on the air-chariot 
intimidating her with bitter words. 
Agonised with anguish when gone into the captivity of Ravana, she that glorious Seetha wailed loudly 
for Rama saying 'oh, Rama,' which Rama has gone deep into the forest by then. 
Ravana who is infatuated with lust picked her up, which lady is disinclined for any kind of sensuality 
and who is verily writhing like the wife of King Cobra, and then he surged skyward and flew off with 
her in his air-chariot. 
While that lord of demons is abducting her in the skyway, Seetha became frenzied with bewildered faculties 
and then bawled stridently like a hysterical person. 
"Haa, greatly dextrous Lakshmana... oh, rejoicer of your mentor... you are incognisant of me who am 
being abducted by this demon who is a dissembler. 
"Oh, Raghava, you have relinquished your high-life, happiness, and riches for the sake of righteousness, 
and though you avowed to protect your observants, you are unobservant of me who am being abducted by 
the unrighteousness itself. 
"Oh, enemy-inflamer Rama, I reckon that you are an absolute controller of uncontrollable beings, I wonder 
why you are not controlling this kind of sinner, Ravana, indeed?" This is how Seetha started her cry 
in wilderness. 
"Indeed, the result for an evil act will not be apparent instantaneously. Even the time becomes a factor 
in the matter of cause and effect, as with the crops becoming cookable after certain time lag." Thus, 
she is addressing Ravana now. 
"The Time has battered your brains and as an infringer you have undertaken this particular exploit, 
whereby you will get a devastating and life-ending tribulation from Rama." Thus, she upbraided Ravana. 

"An honest wife of a glorious one who aspires nothing but honesty, such a wife of Rama as I am, I am 
being abducted, thus the aspiration of Kaikeyi and her kinfolk has now come true. Oh, god!" Thus, she 
soliloquised. 
"I call the attention of the flowered Karnikaara trees of Janasthaana, you inform Rama that Ravana is 
thieving Seetha." Thus, she is addressing the woods and others on the ground from air-chariot. 
"I pray you who are with the bustle of swans and saarasa water birds, oh, River Godavari, you promptly 
tell Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha. 
"I also venerate you, the sylvan deities that travel in this forest with diverse trees or, those that 
abide on the treetops, you may please inform my husband that I am being stolen. 
"Or, over there, some few beings that are living over there on the ground below, I seek shelter of all 
the flocks of birds and hoards of animals, and I pray you to convey this news. 
"Inform my husband about his dear and loftier wife than his lives, saying that, 'helpless Seetha is 
stolen by Ravana.' 
"If that ambidextrous Rama comes to know about me, even if I am taken to heavens, or, even if I am impounded 
by Death, that great-mighty Rama brings me back, on aggressing against all of the gods in heaven, or, 
against Yama, the Death God." Thus, she appealed to one and all, but in vain. 
She that wide-eyed Seetha who is highly anguished and bewailing with pitiable words then with a wide-eyed 
expectancy saw the eagle Jatayu perching on a tree. 
She that well-waisted lady who has gone into the captivity of Ravana craned and stared at the eagle, 
and worsted by fear she shrieked squeakily with a stuttering voice that is walloped with anguish. 
"Oh, fatherly Jatayu, see me, like an orphanized one I am pitiably abducted by this lord of demons with 
sinister deeds. 
"It is impossible for you to forestall this merciless night-walker, for he is formidable, shining forth 
with cunning conquests, also thus this wicked minded one is with weaponry. 
"Oh, Jatayu, everything about my abduction shall be narrated to Rama, or to Lakshmana, as it has happened 
in its entirety." Thus Seetha supplicated Jatayu. Indrajit, the son of Ravana having returned to Lanka, his purpose accomplished, the
leading monkeys surrounded Rama in order to watch over him.
Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Sushena, Kumuda, Nala, Gaja, Gavaksha, Panasa, Sanuprastha
and the mighty Jambavan with Sunda, Rambha, Shatabali and Prithu all these monkeys, armed with
trees, reorganized their ranks, stood alert, surveyed the quarters of the sky up and down and on
every side and, even if a grass stirred, they exclaimed, "It is a demon!"
Ravana, meanwhile, full of joy, dismissed his son Indrajit and thereafter summoned
the female demons who guarded Seetha.
Following his orders, the female-demons along with Trijata appeared before him.
Then, the rejoiced Ravana said to them as follows:
"Tell Seetha that Rama and Lakshmana have been killed by Indrajit. Take her in
Pushpaka the aeroplane and show her Rama and Lakshman who were killed in battle."
"Her husband, the one depending on whom rendered her so proud that she refused to be
united with me, lies there killed with his brother in the battle-front."
"From now on, free from anxiety, grief and expectation of reunion, Seetha the
princess of Mithila kingdom, adorned in all her jewels, will submit herself to me."
"Beholding Rama and Lakshmana fallen under the sway of death on the battle-field
today, finding no other haven and hoping for nothing else, the large-eyed Seetha will voluntarily
seek refuge with me!"
Hearing these words of the cruel Ravana, they all replied, "Be it so" and went to
where the Pushpaka chariot was.
Thereafter, the female-demons brought the aerial car, Pushpaka as per the
instructions of Ravana and carried it nearer to Seetha who was staying in Ashoka-grove.
The female-demons brought Seetha who was afflicted with grief for her husband and
made her to ascend Pushpaka-plane.
The female-demons along with Trijata made Seetha to ascend Pushpaka-plane and
proceeded to show her Rama and Lakshmana.
Ravana the king of demons, thrilled with rapture, caused Lanka to be garlanded with
flags and banners and arranged a proclamation to be made in Lanka announcing that Rama and
Lakshmana had been slain by Indrajit in battle.
Seetha along with Trijata, transported by that plane, saw all the monkey-troops who
had been slain.
Seetha saw the demons who were delighted at heart and monkeys disturbed with grief,
standing round Rama and Lakshmana.
Then, Seetha beheld those two warriors Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious on the
ground on a bed of arrows, their limbs pierced with arrows, riddled with weapons, their armour
shattered, their bows cast aside at a distance and their entire body transfixed by darts.
On seeing those two brothers, who were filled with valour, having lotus-eyes, the
excellent of men, lying streteched on a bed of arrows there in that wretched plight like the two
sons of the fire-god (Shkha and Vishakha) lying on a bed of reeds, Seetha wailed piteously,
stricken as she was with a great agony.
The dark-eyed Seetha the daughter of Janaka with her faultless limbs, beholding her
lord and Lakshmana lying in the dust, burst into sobs.
Witnessing those brothers, the prominent sons of god, Seetha afflicted with tearful
sorrow, believing their death, spoke with grief the following words.Seetha was distressed to hear these words of Rama and spoke these words slowly, with her face with tears.
"know all those disadvantages you mentioned about dwelling in the forest become
advantages to me, if your affection is placed before them."
"Oh Rama! Antelopes, lions, elephants, tigers, sarabhas(legendary animal with eight legs), birds, yaks and all others which roam in the forest, run away after seeing your form, since they have never seen your figure before. When there is cause for fear, who would not have fear?"
"Oh, Rama! As per the command of the elders, I also should go along with you. My
life is to be abandoned here, if I were separated from you."
"Oh Rama! Even Devendra the Lord of celestials, by his strength, cannot over power me, who is in your vicinity."
"Oh Rama! Verily such a thing was taught to me by you, that a woman disunited from her husband should not be able to survive."
"Oh Rama, the very wise! Besides, formerly in my father's house it was heard by me from the month of brahmanas that I was destined to stay really in a forest."
"Oh Rama the man of great strength! Ever since I heard this word from brahmanas who can interpret marks on the body, I was always eager to stay in a forest."
"Oh, Rama the beloved! That prediction of dwelling in the forst is to be realised by me. I must accordingly accompany you to the forest, it cannot be otherwise."
"I shall be the one who has fulfilled the brahmana's word. I shall accompany you to the forest. The time has come for brahmana's words to come true."
"Oh valiant prince! I know that in the forest, sufferings indeed are many and are
invariably obtained by men having unformed minds."
"While I was an unmarried girl, the prediction about my dwelling the forest was
heard by me in my father's house from a female mendicant having good manners, in the presence of my mother."
"Oh Lord! In the past, you have been really pleased for many a time to take me along with you indeed for the tour of a forest, as longed by me."
"Oh, Rama! May all be well with you! I am waiting for a journey to the forest. A
work-out of adventurist is really delightful to me."
"Oh, the pure-minded! Following my husband with loving devotion, I shall become
sin-less; for husband is the supreme deity to me."
"Even after my death, I shall stay united with you. On this subject, the meritorious words of brahmanas is being heard thus:- In this world, which woman was given away to whom by parents with water according to the moral code binding on them, that woman belongs to him alone even after death.
"By what reason now are you thus not willing to take me, the woman having good
conduct, devoted to her husband and belonging to you, from this place?"
"Oh Rama, the seion of Kakutsa! You ought to take me, who is a devotee, so devoted to husband, who is distressed who feels alike in pleasure and pain and shares your joys and sorrows."
"I shall take resort to poison or fire or water for dying, if you are not willing to take me, afflicted as I am, as above."
Eventhough she requested him in many ways about setting out to the forest, he did
not agree to take her to the forest, which is a solitary place.
After hearing Rama's words, seetha was sorrowful, moistening with earth as it were with burning tears, trickling down her eyes.
Rama the prudent man then pacified in many ways, to avert that Seetha with red lips, who was sorrowful as above.Thereafter ogre women with a cruel nature, with crooked faces neared Seetha and spoke unpleasant 
words harshly.
"O Seetha! Why are you not agreeing to stay in the gynaeceum pleasing to all beings together with 
very best beds."
"You who are a human are thinking highly about the wifehood of a human being. Withdraw your mind 
from Rama. Otherwise, you will not exist at all."
"Sport according to your comfort coming together with the king of ogres Ravana enjoying luxuries 
of the three worlds and taking him as husband.
"O beautiful one! O irreproachable one! But being a human you desire that Rama who is a 
human, banished from the kingdom, unsuccessful and gloomy."
Seetha with eyes like lotuses hearing the words of ogre women spoke these words with eyes filled 
with tears.
"All of you coming together whatever words which are hated in the world you spoke in my matter, 
this does it not seem sinful in your mind?"
"Human woman is not waited to become the wife of an ogre. All of you freely eat me. I will not honour 
your words."
"Although wretched or without kingdom, whoever is my husband, He alone is my master. Like Suvarchala 
with the Sun God, I am fond of Him always."
"Like the highly fortunate Sachi who waits upon Indra, like Arundhati on Vasishta, like Rohini 
on the Moon God, like Lopamudra on Agastya, like Sukanya on Chyavana, like Savitri on Satyavanta, like Srimati 
on Kapila, like Madayanti on Saudasa, like Kesini on Sagara, like Damayanti the daughter of Bhima, devoted to 
husband Nala, in the same way, I am devoted to my husband Rama, the best in the Ikshvaku dynasty."
Ogre women incited by Ravana listening to the words of Seetha swooned with anger and frightened 
Her harsh words.
That monkey Hanuma not talking and hiding in the Simsupa tree listened to those ogre women frightening 
Seetha.
Nearing that Seetha shaking with fear in all directions, those ogres being angry licked a lot shining 
and hanging lips.
Being angry a lot and grasping axes quickly spoke as follows: "This woman is not suited to have 
the king of ogres Ravana as husband."
Being frightened by horrible ogre women Seetha with the best face with tears in their eyes 
and moving from there reached that Simsupa tree.
Thereafter the wide-eyed Seetha nearing that Simsupa tree being surrounded by ogre women was situated 
there with gloom.
Those ogres frightened from all directions that Seetha who was emaciated with a pitiful face and 
wearing dirty garments.
Thereafter an ogre woman named Vinata with a horrible appearance with an angry form, crooked, having 
a prominent belly spoke to Her.
"O Seetha! You have shown love for your husband. This much is enough. O auspicious one! At all times 
doing something excessively serves as vice."
"O Seetha! I am happy. Human duty has been done by you. Let there be a fortune to you. Do also according 
to my wholesome words being told."
"Obtain as husband Ravana who is the lord of all l ogres, bold and handsome, like Indra the lord 
of Devas, able one and liberal with a pleasing appearance to all."
"Leaving Rama who is a human and miserable, seeks refuge in Ravana. O Seetha! With best unguents 
to the body and decorated with best ornaments, become mistress of all the worlds from today."
"O auspicious one! Like Svaha the wife of the Fire God, like Sachi the wife of Indra become mistress 
of all worlds. O Seetha! What is the use with Rama who is miserable and with gone vigour."
If you do not do my this spoken word, all of us in this moment will eat you.
Another ogre named Vikata with hanging breasts raising a fist and roaring with anger spoke to Seetha.
"O Seetha with an evil mind! Your many unpleasant words have been tolerated due to pity 
and due to softness."
"O Seetha! You are not doing according to our word which is respected by time and wholesome. You 
have been brought to this bank of the ocean not obtainable by others. You have entered the terrible gynaeceum 
of Ravana."
"Withheld in the house of Ravana well protected by us, even Devendra himself is not capable to 
protect you."
"O Seetha! So according to my word, which is beneficial. Discharge of tears is enough. Leave worthless 
gloom."
"O Seetha! Have love and happiness. Leave this daily gloom. Sport according to comfort with the 
king of ogres."
"O timid one! You know how the youth of women is not lasting. As long as your youth will not pass away, 
so long get comfort."
"O one with intoxicating eyes! You along with the king of ogres roam beautiful groves, mountains and 
nearby forests.
"O beautiful one! seven thousand women will be in your control. Have a husband Ravana the lord 
of all ogres."
"O Seetha! If you do not do according to my spoken word as is, I will eat your heart indeed by 
plucking it out."
Thereafter an ogre woman named Chandodari swooned with anger, turning around a big spike spoke 
this word.
"Seeing this woman with eyes like that of a deer, with moving breasts due to fear, abducted by 
Ravana, there occurred to me a great desire."
"It is my mind to eat the liver, the spleen, flesh above heart and heart together with muscle and 
entrails and the head."
An ogre woman named Pragasa spoke these words: "Squeeze the neck of this cruel woman. Why do we 
delay?"
"After that let it be known to the king that that human woman has died. He will say thus: "Eat.". 
There is no doubt in this matter."
Thereafter an ogre woman named Ajamukhi spoke these words: "All of you killing this woman thereafter 
do equal pieces."
"After that, all of us will divide. Quarrel is not desirable to me. Liquor, many kinds and a lot 
of lickables be brought quickly."
After that an ogre woman named Surpanakha spoke these words: "That which was spoken by Ajamukhi, 
is desirable to me."
"Liquor which is the destroyer of all sorrow is brought quickly. Eating human flesh afterwards, 
we will dance for propitiating Nikumbila."
Thus being frightened by horrible ogres, Seetha equalling a daughter of gods, abandoning fortitude, 
was crying.Seetha listening to that horrible ogre's word, being tormented spoke in reply with a pitiable voice, 
pitifully and slowly.
Being tormented by grief, in a pitiful state, with excellent limbs, devoted to husband, thinking 
about husband alone, with pleasant smiles Seetha was sobbing, shivering, and placing a straw in between herself 
and Ravana spoke thus in reply.
"Turn your mind back from me. Let your mind be made on your wives. Like best emancipation for 
a sinner, it is not appropriate to pray me."
"I was born into a great family. Getting such a family, having one husband, a bad deed that is blameable 
is not to be made by me."
Seetha with renown thus speaking to that Ravana, turned back and spoke words again.
"I who am the wife of another and devoted to husband am not suitable wife to you. Observe righteousness 
well. Follow well course of conduct of virtuous."
"O Ogre! How your wives are to be protected, in the same way others' wives are to be protected. 
Making yourself as an example enjoy your wives."
"One who is not satisfied in own wives, a fickle-minded one with disturbed senses, mean-minded 
one, to such a man, others' wives will lead to humiliation."
"Here are there not good people? Or are you not following those who are good? It must be like that 
because your mind, devoid of traditions is perverse."
"You who is being led by mind towards unreal is not taking wholesome words being said by righteous 
ones for the destruction of ogres."
"After getting a king who has an uncontrolled mind, interested in a bad path, wealthy states and cities 
also will be destroyed. After getting you like that this Lanka filled with the best things in a short while will be 
destroyed due to your one sin."
"O Ravana! When there is destruction of a short-sighted one being hit by his deeds, a sinner, 
living beings will be happy."
"About you who is a sinner thus being destroyed, people who have been humiliated by you being happy 
will speak thus: 'The cruel Ravana by God's grace has got this danger' ".
"I am not capable of being tempted by wealth or by money. I am not separate from Raghava like the 
sun-shine with the sun."
"After making as a pillow that worshipped shoulder of that lord of the world, of that Rama, how 
can I make as pillow some other one's shoulder?"
"Like the education of a brahmin with a famous mind, initiated in the religious vow, I am suitable 
wife to that Rama alone the lord of the earth."
"O Ravana! Let me meet together with Rama like a female elephant with a male elephant in a forest."
"It is suited that this Rama, best among men, is made to be a friend by you who is desiring continued 
existence and not desiring a horrible slaying."
"Rama the righteous one is indeed known as one who loves those who seek protection. If you desire 
to live. let there be friendship between you and Rama."
"You seek graciousness of this Rama who loves those who seek protection. Becoming piously disposed, 
you are suited to return me to this Rama."
"In this way giving me to Rama will become fortunate to you. O Ravana! If you do it in a different 
way, you will get slayed."
"Drawn out Vajrayudha, the weapon of Indra may spare some one like you. Lord of death may spare 
you for a long time. That Rama the lord of worlds greatly enraged will not spare you."
"Like the great sound of Vajrayudha hurled by Indra, you will hear a loud and sonorous sound 
of Rama's bow."
"Arrows with good nodes, with blazing tips, like snakes, with characteristic signs of Rama and 
Lakshmana will fall soon here in Lanka."
"Arrows tied with the plumes of an eagle will hit ogres everywhere in this city and will cover 
the city without space."
"That Garuda called Rama speedily will pluck the great serpents called ogres like Vainateya plucking 
the serpents."
"My husband who is a destroyer of foes will take me away from you like Lord Vishnu with three steps 
taking away the brilliant prosperity from Asuras."
"O ogre! While the army of ogres was being killed at Janasthana which became the land of the dead, 
this bad deed has been done by you being powerless."
"O lowest one! When those brothers were gone out, entering hermitage without them, I have been 
abducted by you."
"Like tiger by a dog, smelling the scent of Rama and Lakshmana it is indeed not possible for you to 
stand in their view."
"To you like that, enmity with those two is like the enmity of one hand of Vruttasura with two 
hands of Indra and it is not persevering for you to be an opponent with them."
"My husband that Rama together with Lakshmana will take away with His arrows your life quickly 
like the sun drying up shallow water."
"Killed by time even if you go to the mountain of Kubera or his house or if you go to the assembly 
of King Varuna, without doubt, you will not be released from Rama like a great tree from a thunderbolt."
Hearing the harsh words with indignation, spoken by Rama, which caused her hair to
stand on end, Seetha became very much perturbed.
Hearing the terrific words of her husband, which were never actually heard by her
before, amidst a large gathering of people, Seetha stood bent low with shame.
As though her own limbs were pierced by those words, which were arrow-like with
pointed splinters, Seetha shed profuse tears.
Then, wiping clean her face, which was bathed in tears, she spoke the following
words slowly, in a stammering voice to her husband.
"O valiant Rama! Why are you speaking such harsh words, which are violent to hear
for me, like a common man speaking to a common woman?"
"O the long-armed one! I am not the one in the way you understand me. Have a faith
in me. I swear to you by my own character."
"By the conduct of vulgar woman you distrust the entire race of women. Give up this
doubt, if I have been actually tested (and found trustworthy) by you."
"O lord! It was not my willfulness, when I came into contact with the person of
Ravana. I was helpless. My adverse fate was to blame on that score."
"My heart, which was subservient to me, was abiding in you. What could I do,
helpless as I was, with regard to my limbs which had fallen under the sway of another?"
"O bestower of honour! If I could not be fully known to you, in spite of our love
having simultaneously grown and despite of our having lived together, I am ruined permanently by
such ignorance."
"O king! Hanuma, the great hero, was sent by you as your search-agent. Why I, who
was still in Lanka, was not abandoned then itself?"
"O hero! Life would have been given up by me, when deserted by you; immediately on
hearing the message (conveying your desertion) before the eyes of the monkey."
"This wasteful endeavour (in the form of crossing over to Lanka and waging war
against the mighty Ravana, keeping your life in jeopardy), would not have been there, nor would
have your friends been put to such fruitless hardship."
"O excellent king! You, however, like a feeble man, gave priority to womanliness,
conforming yourself to just an emotion of anger."
"O knower of virtuous conduct! My birth was from Janaka in disguise; but was
actually from the earth. My sacred birth of such a high degree, was not honoured by you."
"My hand taken (by you as a bride) in our childhood was not duly recognized by you.
My devotion, my chastity and all have been ignored by you."
Seetha, thus speaking, weeping and stammering with tears, said to Lakshmana, who was
sad and engaged in thoughtfulness (as follows):
"O Lakshmana! Create a pile of fire, for me, which is a remedy for this disaster. I
no longer wish to survive, smitten as am with false blames."
"I will enter a fire, to obtain the only course appropriate for me, who has been
abandoned amidst an assembly of men, by my husband who was not satisfied with my traits."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemy warriors, giving way
to wrath, looked towards Rama.
Understanding the inclination of the mind of Rama, hinted by the expression in his
face, that valiant Lakshmana prepared a pyre, in deference to the wishes of Rama.
No one near and dear was indeed able to cajole on that occasion or to speak or even
to look upon Rama, who appeared like Yama the lord of death at the time of dissolution of the
world.
Thereupon, Seetha, after doing circumambulation to Rama, who was standing with his
head bent low, proceeded towards the blazing fire.
Having offered salutation to gods and brahmins as also having joined her palms in
the vicinity of the fire, Seetha spoke the following words:
"As my heart never moves off from Rama, so let the fire-god, the witness of the
world, protect me from all sides."
"As Rama apprehends me, though of unimpeachable conduct, to be spoilt, let the
fire-god the witness of the world protect me from all sides."
"As I have never been unfaithful in act, thought and speech to Rama, who knows all
the virtues, so let the fire-god protect me."
"Since the adorable sun-god, wind-god, the four quarters and even so the moon-god,
as also the deity presiding over the day-time and the twilights and the night and the earth and
even others know me to be endowed with good conduct, so let the fire-god protect me."
Thus speaking, Seetha walking around the fire-god, with her mind free from
hesitation, entered the blazing fire.
A large gathering of men including children and elders, saw the shining Seetha
having entered the fire there.
That Seetha, with the shining of fresh refined gold and decked with ornaments of
refined gold, plunged into the blazing fire, in the presence of all people.
All the living beings saw then that wide-eyed Seetha, who looked like a golden
altar, plunging into the fire.
The sages, gods, and the Gandharvas saw that illustrious Seetha entering deep into
the fire as a sacred oblation of clarified butter.
All the women (who were present there) screamed on seeing her, rushing into the
fire, like a gush of clarified butter plunging into the sacrificial fire, duly consecrated by Vedic
hymns.
The denizens of the entire three worlds including the gods, Gandharvas and demons,
beheld her falling into the fire, like a goddess, subjected to a curse, falling from heaven to
hell.
While she was entering deeply into the fire, a loud sound, which appeared strange,
uttering 'Alas, Alas' rose both from the demons and the monkeys alike.The prince Rama, having been invoked blessings by his mother, after having
salutation to Kausalya and remaining firmly in his virtuous path, set out journey to the forest.
Entering to the road filled with people, he made it shine with his splendour and stirred the hearts of the people because of his excellent qualities.
Sita, practising for the coronation ceremony, did not hear anything on that matter.
She was thinking of installation of Rama alone as prince Regent in her heart
As she knows what is to be done and is aware of rules relating to kings Sita herself
being rejoiced in heart, performed the worship of the gods and was waiting for the prince.
Thereafter Rama, slightly turning his face down , entered his own house which is
well decorated and is filled with rejoicing people all around
Sita sprang up from her seat and trembled by seeing her husband stricken with
sorrow, his mind perturbed with anxiety.
By seeing her, Rama the virtuous man could not contain that grief existing in his
mind and hence got unveiled.
Seeing him pale-faced, perspired and without endurance, Sita (stricken with grief) spoke thus what is this now , my Lord!
Oh , Rama! It is indeed told by learned brahmanas that today's constellation Pushya (which is presided by sage bR^ihaspati) which is propitions, is suitable (for coronation). Why are you sadly disposed?
Your handsome face does not shine splendidly as it should when covered by an
umbrella white as water-froth and provided with a hundred ribs.
Nor your lotus -eyed face is not being fanned (as it should ) by superior chowries shining like a moon and a swan
Nor the overjoyed and eloquent bards Sutas and Maagadhas (who sing portions of epic poems and ancient ballads ) are seen here , praising you with auspicious words .
Nor brahmanas who are well-versed in Vedas, have not placed , as per prescribed
Rites , honey and curds on your head after you had taken the head -bath
All ministers, chiefs of Associations, citizens and country-folk, duly decked with ornaments, are not inclined to go along with you.
Why the main carriage used for travelling and pleasure, tied with four horses decked with gold ornaments and with excellent speed does not go ahead of you ?
Oh, valiant prince! A glorious elephant which is worshipped for its good
characteristics, resembling a mountain crowned with a dark cloud is not seen ahead in your journey.
Oh, brave man pleasant with the sight! I do not see marching before you an elephant having been placed in front with an excellent seat embroidered in gold meant for you While coronation is getting ready now, the colour of your face is appearing strange.
Even happiness is not being seen (in you). Why is it?
Rama spoke thus to Sita, who is lamenting : Oh, Sita! My venerable father is sending me to a forest in exile.
Oh, Sita ! You are born in a great family. You know what is Right and practise
virtue . hear me in what sequence it happened to me Two great boons were given to my mother Kaikeyi long ago , by my father Dasaratha who is true to a promise.
Now that the arrangements initiated by the king for my coronation are getting ready , Kaikeyi came out with that promise of boons, turning the situation to her own advantage by grounds of morality
I have to dwell in Dandaka forest for fourteen years .Bharata is being appointed as prince by my father Before setting forth to the lonely forest, I came to see you. I should not be praised at any time in the presence of Bharata . Men endowed with power and fortune indeed do not tolerate praise of others . Therefore, my virtues should not be extolled by you in front of Bharata.
You need not be attended in a special manner at any time by him. You can stay
familiar to him, by behaving with him conformably.
The princely kingdom is given to him by the king permanently. Oh, Sita ! He is fit to be rendered gracious by you, more so the king Dasaratha
Keeping up the pledge of my father, today itself. Oh, Sita of magnanimous mind!
Remain firm.
Oh, Sita the good and faultless lady ! After I leave for the forest frequented by
the sages, you can become interested in religious vows and fastings.
You can rise up in dawn , perform worship of the deities as per precept and do
salutation to my father , king Dasaratha.
Keeping in front of righteousness alone, you have to respect the aged Kausalya, my mother who is getting emaciated by grief.
For me all my mothers are equal in my eyes in point if fondness, love and the way in which they have looked after me ( in my childhood). Hence the rest of mothers also deserve to be saluted always by you
You, in particular, should regard Bharata and Satrughna, as your brothers or
sons.
Bharata is indeed king and the master both for the kingdom and for our family .
Hence, you should not do what is displeasing to him at any time.
Kings being pleased by good character and served by exerting one's self become
happy. They get angry if it is to the contrary
Kings abandon even their own sons, if they are antagonistic and accept even other
people if they are fitting Oh good lady ! You such dwell here, doing conformably to the will of Bharata the king, remaining devoted to righteousness and with a vow of truth as you end.
Oh, my dear Sita ! I can go to the great forest. You can stay here only, without
doing harm to any one as it is .Listen to my words.Both the sons of that best king Dasharatha, on taking up westerly path in that forest travelled on the 
passage to Pampa as shown by Kabandha. 
Those two, Rama and Lakshmana, while seeing several of the ticketed trees on mountains which have nectarous 
fruits on them moved forward to see Sugreeva. 
Those two legatees of Raghu on making a sojourn on the mountaintop, they the Raghava-s drew nigh of 
the moorland on the westward of Pampa Lake. 
Then on getting at the westward moorland of that lotus-lake Pampa, there those two have spotted the 
idyllic hermitage of Shabari. 
On getting at that hermitage and on perusing at that picturesque environ that is wreathed round with 
several picturesque trees, those two came nigh of Shabari. 
On seeing them that sublimated yogi Shabari instinctively made palm-fold, got up imperatively, and then 
she braced the feet of Rama, and even that of sagacious Lakshmana, impressively. 
She gave them water for feet-wash and mouthwash, and other viands customarily affordable to visitants, 
and then Rama asked after that anchoress who is unflinchingly abiding in her duty. 
"Oh, ascetically wealthy lady, perchance your deterrents in ascesis are completely overcome, somehow... 
your ascetic practises culminating, someway... your annoyances and ailments are adjusted, somewhat... 
isn't it! 
"Oh, suave speaker, mayhap your sacred commitments are achieved, anywise... appeased is your self, anyway... 
and your subservience to your mentors brought to fruition, perchance... isn't it!" Thus Rama enquired 
with Shabari. 
When Rama asked her in this way she that Shabari who is a senescent anchoress, sublimated yogin and 
an adherent to the sublimated yogis of higher rank, informed Rama remaining in his vis-�-vis. 
"Just now, on your pleasing manifestation before me my ascesis is accomplished, and now only my birth 
is fructified, and now only my subservience to my mentors is well hallowed... 
"Oh, best one among men, now all my ascesis is fructified when I personally worshiped you, who are none 
other than the best god among gods, thus the heaven will also be there for me... 
"Oh, kind one, your blessed sight has sanctified me... and oh, endower of respect, by your beneficence 
I wish to go to those returnless worlds because I have subjugated those enemies of yours, viz.,ari SaD varga-sin me, and I think my prayer to you is justified because 
you are a subjugator of such enemies... 
"Divine aircrafts of unequalled refulgence have lifted those disciples of Sage Matanga in whose tendance 
I was, to welkin on your arriving at Chitrakuta... 
"Those knowers of probity, highly providential, and eminent-saints have told me, 'Rama will come to 
this highly blest hermitage of yours along with Soumitri... and you have to cordially welcome them as 
your guests, and on your seeing him you will go to best worlds, where merit remains undiminished...' 

"Oh, best one among men Rama, thus I was told by those highly providential sages, oh, best one among 
men, oh, manly tiger, and I have gleaned various forest fruits and eatables that occur on the moorlands 
of Pampa Lake for your sake..." So said Shabari to Rama. 
When that graceful souled Rama is addressed thus by Shabari, he that Raghava enquiringly said this to 
that Shabari who is never ever debarred from esoteric knowledge and gnosis. 
"Your and your preceptors' effectiveness is heard in effect from the wraith of the great souled Danu's 
son, Kabandha, and if you feel showing it like I wish to clearly see it, personally..." Thus Rama asked 
her to show hermitage. 
On hearing those words voiced by Rama, Shabari started to show that unique woodland to both of them. 

"Oh, Rama the delight of Raghu's lineage... this one comparable to a crammed cloud that would be ever 
ready to yield much cherished cloudbursts, and compacted with animals and birds that are ever ready 
to enjoy seasonable rains, is that hermitage to which you have come, that way this woodland is well 
known as Matanga, meaning a cloud, or an elephant, or an elephantine cloud that showers blessings on 
all... and oh, highly resplendent Rama, you may see this nest, snuggery, where those contemplative souls, 
my teachers, used to conduct oblations into the Ritual-fires, orienting and worshipping them with Vedic 
hymns... 
"Where those great sages that are highly revered by me used to offer flowers with their extremely doddery 
hands in the worship the Altar of Fire, this alone is that Altar of Fire raised at western end... 
"Oh, best one from Raghu-s, by the efficacy of the ascesis of my teachers these Altars of Fire are with 
incomparable irradiance, and even now they are irradiating all of the directions with solemnity... see 
them... 
"Enervated by dieting and straining they were incapable to go for sea bathing, and just at their thought 
process all the seven seas came close by, in coalescence... see them... 
"On performing holy baths those sages have spread their jute cloths on those trees with their own doddering 
hands here at this place and oh, Raghu's legatee, those cloths did not dry even now by the touch of 
their hands... 
"Which garlands they have knotted together with black-lotuses and other flowers while they were worshiping 
gods, these are really those garlands, and indeed there is no discolouration to them... 
"You have seen what is seeable and you have listened what is listenable of this woodland in its entirety... 
thereby I wish to become a permittee, where you alone are my permitter, as I wish to castaway this sheathe 
of soul, called my body... to make that soul to move nigh of my teachers feet... 
"Of which sages this hermitage is, and of which sages I am also a maidservant, I soulfully go the proximity 
of those contemplative souls..." Thus, she appealed to Rama. 
Rama on hearing those duty-congruous words of Shabari along with Lakshmana, obtained a uniquely high 
rejoice and he also said, "astonishing is this..." 
Then Rama spoke to that Shabari who is firmed up in her faith towards her masters, "oh, saintly lady, 
you treated me with deference... thus may go to your cherished worlds, where you can solace yourself 
with your masters... 
Thus that way said by Rama in consent, she who is wearing tufty-matted hair, jute-cloths, and deerskin 
as her clothing, she offered herself as an oblation into Ritual-fire, and then like a flaring fire, 
she went to heaven alone. 
Now she appeared as an angle bejewelled with angelic ornaments, wearing angle's wraparound and angelical 
flowery tassels, and bedaubed with suchlike cosmetics, and as with the scintillations of electric sparks 
she scintillated that province. 
Shabari who is a perfect yogin with perfected meditative concentration, now went to that sanctum locus 
where the blest souls of those sublime sages, namely her masters, saunter. "I on my part shall tell you, who are keenly observing about those army-chiefs, who
are ready to show their valour in the case of Rama, even without caring for their lives."
"He is a monkey called Hara, who has terrific acts to his credit. The hair on his
tail, measuring many fathoms, soft, red in colour, yellow, white and super-white, wavery and
shining like the rays of the sun standing erect thrown about are dragging along the ground."
"Hundreds and thousands of troop-leaders who are resolved to be the servants of
Sugreeva rally behind him, carrying trees with them and with an intention to attack Lanka
soon."
"O, king! Those who appear black like black-clouds and akin to black collyrium are
extremely ferocious bears, truly mighty in combat, which are in exceedingly large number,
indefinable like the other shore of an ocean, whom you are observing and serve of whom reside in
mountains, plains and on river-banks. They are all coming towards you."
"O, king! He who is standing in the middle, with terrific eyes and of fearful
appearance, encircled by all like Parjanya (the rain-god) being encircled by clouds; is the
army-chief called Dhumra, the Lord of all bears, who drinks the waters of River Narmada and resides
on an excellent mountain named Rikshavanta."
"See him who is appearing like a mountain the younger brother of Dhumra, though in
form resembling like his brother, is more distinguished in prowess. He as such is a commander of
even the mighty generals called Jambavan, who is setting on the march (for the battle). He has a
respectful behaviour towards venerable persons impatient in battle."
By the intelligent Jambavan, a great help was rendered to Indra (the lord of
celestials) in a battle between celestials and demons and many boons were obtained."
"Jambavan's giant bodied troops, resembling demons and devils, having thick hair and
endowed with unlimited energy, wander about, climbing mountain-heights and hurl massive rocks as
big as huge clouds. They do not have a fear in facing death."
"O, king! This Lord of monkeys- the commander of commanders on whom, whether he is
in a hurried fury or leaping or standing still and all the monkeys stand looking - he is called
Dambha who along with his bulky troops dwell on Sahasraksha mountain."
"He who, walking on all fours touches with his flanks, a mountain situated at a
distance of one Yojana (eight miles) and reaching an object one Yojana high, obtains it with his
body, whose huge form no other four-begged animal is having, by which intelligent monkey, battle
was given earlier to Indra the Lord of celestials on a field of battle but no defeat was sustained
by him, he is a commander of commanders and the grand-father of monkeys, famous as Samnadana by
name."
"This Samnada, whose striding prowess is equal to that of Indra the Lord of
Celestials was born of a youthful Gandharva maiden and krishnavartman for the purpose of helping
the celestials in a combat between celestials and demoneous."
"O king of demons! This commander named Krathana, the son of Visravasa, the
illustrious one, sits beneath the Jambu tree, on that mountain, the king of peaks, which is
frequented by Kinneras, and which mountain affords delight constantly to your brother. It is near
there, Krathana, that fortunate one, that powerful lord of the monkeys, whose prowess in not
confined to words in battles, sports."
"He indeed is standing, surrounded by a thousand crores of monkeys. He hopes to
crush Lanka with the help of his army."
"He who usually roams by the Ganges, sowing terror among leaders of herds of
elephants, remembering as he does the old quarrel between elephants and monkeys, thundering and
uprooting trees, he is the commander and leader of monkeys called Pramathim who dwells in
mountain-caves, subduing wild elephants."
"This excellent one among the monkeys and this army-chief of monkeys, taking shelter
in Mandara the foremost of mountains and the mountain called ushirabija alongside the River Ganga,
passes his life happily like unto Indra himself."
"A hundred thousands of monkeys; proud of their strength and prowess with their
radiant fore-arms, making a roaring noise, are following him."
"He is the leader of these high-soled monkeys. O, king! He is the commander called
Pramathi, the one difficult to be conquered."
"He whom you are beholding a cloud raised by wind is Pramathi. At that place, a
great quantity of red illumined dust is tossed about and raised by wind in various ways in
different directions. Energetic and excited army of monkeys is also stationed there along with
Pramathi."
"O, monarch! One hundred lakhs of monkeys with their black faces, with fearful
appearance and with great strength, experiencing the crossing of the bridge, surrounds the
troop-leader by name Gavaksha, a monkey and are making a roaring noise, ready to crush Lanka by
their bodily strength."
"O, king! This army-chief called Kesari, the chief of the commanders of monkeys,
wanders in Kanchana mountain wherein there are trees which yield fruits in all seasons, inhabited
by large black-bees, to which the sun circumambulates clock-wise, the mountain shining with its own
colour and splendour, by whose brightness, the animals and birds ever shine with the same hue,
whose table-land on the top of the mountain the great sages do not leave, wherein trees, all
mango-trees laden with fruits on all sides and wherein inhabit honey-bees of excellent
variety."
"O, faultless king! There are sixty thousand mountains in that beautiful golden
mountain ranges. There is an excellent mountain the middle of that mountain range as you the middle
of that demons. In that mountain range there, in the last mountain these monkeys reside. Some of
the monkeys are tawny coloured, some are white-coloured and with nails as their weapons; having
four tusks, with nails as their weapons having four tusks like lions, difficult to be approached
like tigers, resembling fire, like unto serpents vomiting poison with their very long coiling
tails, resembling elephants in rut, equal to mighty mountains and making great thunderous sound
like that of clouds. All of them stand looking on your Lanka as if they are about to crush it."
"O, king! He who stands in the middle is the powerful leader of the monkeys who ever
faces the sun, who is a wise man, eager to conquer you and is famous in the world by the name,
Shatabali. He swears to destroy Lanka with his troops."
"This Shatabali the monkey is courageous, strong, valiant and is established in his
manliness. He does not care for his life, in the cause of Rama."
"Each and every single one, like Gaja, Gavaya, Nala and a monkey called Nila is
surrounded by crores of warriors."
"Besides, other excellent monkeys residing in Vindhya mountain are quick-paced and
are impossible to be counted because of their multitude."
"O, monarch! All of them are highly prominent, their stature equal to high hills and
all of them are capable in a moment to level the earth by uprooting and razing its mountains earth
by uprooting and razing its mountains to the ground."Thereafter, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana spoke the following words to Bharata, who was tormented with grief and who desired to undertake an expedition to Rama.
"When that even-minded Rama is a refuge for all beings, how much more to tell about our seeking solace to him in our grief? He has been abandoned to the forest by a woman."
"Why the so-called Lakshmana, the strong and powerful man, even could not rescue
Rama from distress by making our father to restrain from doing it?"
"By perceiving the prudence and imprudence in that wrong course adopted by the king, who has fallen into the clutches of a woman, Lakshmana should have restrained Dasaratha even at the beginning itself."
While Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana was talking thus, the hump-backedManthara duly adorned with all types of ornaments, appeared at the eastern gate.
Anointed with a scent of sandal-wood and wearing royal clothes, she was bedecked
with several kinds of ornaments of every description in various ways.
Studded with bright-coloured girdle-bands and many other excellent ornaments,
Manthara appeared like a female-monkey tied with ropes!
Beholding that hump-backed Manthara, the very much sinful and insensitive woman, the door-keepers caught her and delivered her to Shatrughna (with the following words:)
"Here is that sinful and cruel woman, by whose act Rama is in the forest and your
father has laid down his body. Do with her, as you consider fitting."
Hearing those words, Shatrughna who was very much in grief and was firmly resolute, spoke to all those inmates of that gynaecium, as follows:
"Let this woman, who created serious misfortune to my brothers and my father,
receive the fruit of her cruel act."
Speaking thus in the midst of her companions, he seized that hunch-backed woman with his powerful hand soon and she in turn made that mansion resound with her shrieks.
Then, her companion, having conceived Shatrughna's anger and extremely agonised as they were, ran away helter-shelter in all directions.
All the company of women there surmised as follows : "The way how he is coming up, he will surely slay us all"
"We shall take reguge with the compassionate, magnanimous, virtuous and illustrious Kausalya. Let her be the sure asylum for us."
That Shatrughna, the tormentor of enemies, with his raging red eyes then violently dragged the crying hump-back along the floor.
While that Manthara was violently dragged, here various colourful ornaments were
scattered asunder here and there on the floor.
Thus, that splendid royal mansion scattered by those ornaments, appeared very much like an autumnal sky studded with innumerable stars.
Shatrughna, the strong and the eminent man, thus violently seizing her with rage,
sharply rebuked Kaikeyi and spoke harsh words to her.
Agonised very much by those harsh and painful words, Kiakeyi overwhelmed as she was with the fear of Shatrughna, took refuge with Bharata.
Seeing that enraged Shatrughna, Bharata said: "Among all beings women are not to be killed. Hence she is to be pardoned."
"If the pious Rama were not to express his displeasure with me for killing the
mother, I would have killed this Kaikeyi, the ill-mannered and sinful woman."
"If the virtuous Rama hears that the hunch-backed woman has been killed, it is sure that he will cease to talk to you or even to me."
Hearing the words of Bharata, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana renouncing his guilty design forthwith released that Manthara.
Manthara fell at the feet of Kaikeyi, breathless, weeping piteously.
Seeing the hunch-backed woman, who was distraught on account of shatrughna's
violence, wearing a disturbed appearance and looking like a crane that has been caught in a noose, Bharata's mother slowly consoled her.After listening to Sarana's words Shuka, pointing out all that army of monkeys,
spoke the following words to Ravana the Lord of Demons.
"O, king! Do you observe those monkeys resembling huge elephants in rut, rising like
banyan trees on the banks of River Ganga or Sala trees on Himalayas? Those warriors, able to change
their form at will, are irresistible, equal to celestials and demons, and in a battle, are endowed
with the valour of the gods."
"There are twenty one thousand crores, a thousand Shankus and a hundred Vrindas of
these monkeys."
"These monkeys, the attendants of Sugreeva born of celestials and celestial
musicians, are able to change their form at will and always stay in Kishkindha."
"The two who stand there, who have the same resemblance and have the appearance of
celestials, are Mainda and Dvivida. None can equal them in combat."
"These two, who ate ambrosion on due authorization by Brahma, are hopefully of
destroying Lanka by their power."
"As for that monkey who you see there, resembling an intoxicated elephant, who in
strength and fury is able to churn up the ocean itself, it is he who came to Lanka to find Seetha
and spy on you, O, Lord! See that monkey, who was seen earlier and who appears here again."
"This monkey, by whom the ocean was traversed, is the eldest son of Kesari. He is
known as the son of wind-god and famously called as Hanuman."
"This excellent monkey can assume any form at will. He is endowed with a good
strength and form always moving like the wind-god, having an uninterrupted mobility."
"While yet a child, seeing the sun rise, he desired to eat it and took off to a
distance of three thousand yojanas (or twenty four thousand miles) reflecting:  I shall seize hold
of the sun and my hunger will not be appeased otherwise' and they say, he leapt up (into the air)
intoxicated as he was with his own strength."
"Without even reaching the sun, which is most unassailable even to celestials, sages
or demons, he however fell on a mountain, where that radiant orb rises."
"One of the jaws of this monkey who fell down on the head of the rock, was a little
fractured. For this reason, because of his strong jaw, he is called Hanuma."
"This monkey is known to me actually through the words of my bosom friends. It is
not possible to describe his strength or physical form or glory."
"He alone wants to destroy Lanka by his valour. How do you forget this monkey by
whom this fire was lighted and is still blazing up Lanka."
"Nearby is a warrior, dark of hue with eyes like lotuses, a chief warrior among
Ikshvakus, his heroism is well-known in the world, his sense of duty never wavers, nor does he ever
transgress the righteousness, he knows to loose Brahma's weapon and is conversant with Veda, he is
the most learned of the Vedic scholars, he shatters the firmament with his arrows, and rends even
the earth, his anger is akin to that of Death, his valour equal to that of Indra the god of
celestials, his consort is Seetha who was taken away by you from a place called Janasthana, he is
Rama who has come to wage war on you, O king!"
"This man, having the radiance of pure gold, with a broad chest, having red eyes,
with black and curled hair, standing at the right side of Rama, he is called Lakshmana, who is
interested in the care and welfare of his brother, skilled in leadership of combat and excellent
among the wielders of all weapons."
This Lakshmana is an angry person, difficult to be conquered, victorious, wise and
mighty. He has always been the right arm of Rama and in outward moving life (of Rama).
"He does not indeed care for his life in the cause of Rama. He alone wishes to kill
all the demons in battle."
"He who is standing there, taking guard at the left side of Rama, surrounded by a
troop of demons he is the king Vibhishana."
"He, who was consecrated as a king for Lanka by the illustrious Rama, the king of
kings, is enraged really with you and is to attack us in the battle."
"The other whom you see as an unshakable mountain and standing in the centre of
monkeys as a Lord of all chiefs of monkeys, with a boundless energy and who, like a Himalayan hill,
very much radiating the other monkeys by his splendour, glory, wisdom, strength and his noble
descent, who occupies along with the chiefs of Army Generals, a secret place called Kishkindha,
with its forests and trees and the place inaccessible because of its impassable mountains, in which
is established a good fortune of celestials and human beings, whose charming and golden coloured
garland with hundred lotuses is beautifying, that person is Sugreeva. This garland along with a
lady called Tara as well as the permanent kingdom of monkeys were presented to him by Rama after
having killed Vali (Sugreeva's brother)."
"Wise men call a hundred lakhs as a crore. A hundred thousand crores is reckoned as
a Shanku."
"A hundred thousand Shankus are said to be one Maha Shanku. A hundred thousand Maha
Shankus are called one Vrindam here. A hundred thousand Vrindas are said to be one Maha vrindam. A
hundred thousand Mahavrindas are called one Padmam here. A hundred thousand padmas are said to be
one Mahapadmam. A hundred thousand Mahapadmas are called one Kharvam here. A hundred thousand
kharvas are said to be one Mahakharvam. A hundred thousand Mahakharvas are called one Samundram. A
hundred thousand Samudras are said to be one ogha here. A hundred thousand oghas are acclaimed a
one Mahaugha."
"This Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, having great strength and valour, always
surrounded by a colossal army, is approaching you to make war, accompanied by the valiant
Vibhishana and the ministers, as also a hundred thousand crores of Shankas, a thousand Mahashankus,
a hundred Vrindas, a thousand mahavrindas, a hundred padmas, a thousand Mahapadmas, a hundred
kharves, samudras and Mahaughas of the same number, and a crore of Mahanghas wholearmy as such is
identical of an ocean."
"O, king! Carefully observing this army, which appears much the same as a blazing
planet, prepare yourself for a great effort to get victory and take measures to avoid defeat from
the enemies."This chapter vies with the rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and 
			his kingship. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal withraaja niiti shastra'political science' and there in Kishkindha the only 
			rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in 
			here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shuurpanakha. Though Shuurpanakha 
			is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue 
			in forewarning Ravana.
Then that doleful Shuurpanakha spoke these scornful words to Ravana who makes the world to wail in the 
presence of his ministers. 
"Highly infatuated with lustful gratifications you are incontinent and unchecked, thus you are unobservant 
of a calamitous jeopardy that has surfaced, though you ought to be observant of it as a king. 
"If a king deports himself in an overly self-assured manner, that too with self-serving motives, and 
clings only to dirty pleasures, he will be unhonoured by people as with a crematory fire. 
"The king who will not deal with the concerns of kingdom, in person and on time, he and his kingdom 
and even those concerns of his kingdom will get ruined. 
"If a king is inaccessible to spies for exchange of information, unavailable for subjects for an audience 
for a similar appraisal, more so if he is intemperately not able to impose self-discipline, people will 
eschew such a king from a distance as elephants will refrain themselves from the mud of river from a 
distance. 
"Which of those kings that will not safeguard their kingdoms by remaining in a self-restrained manner, 
they will not outshine advantageously, like mountains submerged under ocean. 
"Without keeping the kingdom under your personal control, you have shuffled the administration onto 
the ministers and army personnel like Khara, Duushana et al. And these figureheads alone become the 
tiderips, for they quarrel among themselves about the kingship of Lanka after your ruin, and they alone 
are floating like oceanic tides up above your head and thus you are a submerged sovereign. In any way, 
your doom is destined either by Rama, who is an imminent danger, or by your military managers, who are 
the in-built dangers."
"Externally you are belligerent with sensible gods, gandharva-s and other demons, and internally you 
are needful of intelligence agents, and such as you are, you are an erratic even, then how can you thrive 
as a king! 
"Your bent is boyish and you are mindless, oh, demon, you are not able to know the knowable danger because 
you are carefree, and how do you thrive as a king! 
"Oh, so-called best one among triumphant kings, those kings that do not retain spies, treasuries and 
strategies under their control, but vouchsafe them to others, they are of a piece with the peasantry. 

"Oh, titular overlord of humans, only some can be called prescient kings because they see all the situations 
happening distantly through their spies. 
"I believe that you have no spies worth their profession, yet you are associated with artless ministers 
worthy to worship you, hence you are incognisant of the ruination of all of your subjects in Janasthaana, 
including Janasthaana. 
"A single soul called Rama has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of dreadful deeds in Janasthaana, 
even Duushana is killed, even Khara is also killed. 
"That indefatigable champion Rama gave security to the sages, rendered Dandaka forest safeguarded, and 
he put Janasthaana to rout. 
"On your part you are but selfish, hotheaded, and others like the appeasers of your lust, or these artless 
ministers, or those underpaid unfaithful spies hold you down, and such as you are, you are unperceptive 
of the calamity rising up against you in your own kingdom. 
"Should a king be overweening, an under-payer, an improvident, self-conceited, and dubious, all his 
subjects bid goodbye to such a king when he is in strife. 
"Should a ruler be unduly self-conceited, self-centred, self-adulating and a spitfire too, his own kith 
and kin will ruin him when he is in distress. 
"That king who does not officiate his good offices, nor un-panicked into panicky situations, he will 
be quickly overthrown from his kingdom, and on becoming a debased individual he will be equated with 
a piece of straw in this world. 
"Dried sticks, globs or the particles of dust are of some avail, but kings fallen from their position 
are of no avail. 
"As to how a used up raiment or a crumpled flower-tassel is meaningless, likewise a king derelict from 
his kingdom, though functional, is meaningless. 
"Which king will be cautious, clever, conscientious, with his controlled senses, and thankful, that 
king survives for a long time. 
"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness will be wakeful even though he slept well closing his physical 
eyes and he who will make his fury and favour evident to people without any concealment or cunningness, 
people will highly revere him as a king.
"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness wakeful even though he sleeps fast closing his physical eyes, 
thus discarded are his fury and frenzy as well, because he knows as to who is to be treated furiously 
and who is to be favoured, and thus people will revere him as a judicious king. 
"But, oh, Ravana, because you are imprudent you are bereft of these merits, and such as you are, unknown 
is the very great massacre of demons to you, though not personally, but at least through your spies. 

"You are the humiliator of others, you hobnob only with your ravishes, and incognisant of the object 
for apportionment of time and place for your activities, as to when and where and how the things are 
to be dealt with. And, as you are not attending any kingly activity, or do not focus your mind in deciding 
rights and wrongs, thereby your kingdom will get ruined and you will be imperilled, not before long." 
Thus Shuurpanakha declaimed Ravana about his worthlessness as a king. 
In this way when Shuurpanakha extolled only his negative traits, he that lord of night-walkers Ravana, 
who holds only his pride, power and prosperity dear to him, pored them over in his mind and contemplated 
over a time. Then, Dasaratha the scion of Ikshvaku dynasty, squeezed by his own promise in the
matter of sending Rama to exile, sighed heavily with tears and spoke the following words again and agian to Sumantra.
"Oh, Sumantra! Let a military body consisting of (all) the four limbs of the arms, filled with the best of its kind, be arranged immediately"
"Let courtesans well versed in speaking and merchants with great riches having
exposure for extension of sales bestow elegance to the forces of the Prince"
Appoint in this contingent those too, by giving abundant money to them who were
dependent on Rama and on whom he took delight in gallantry"
"Let important weapons, chiefs of police and vehicles, hunters knowing the secrets of forest accompany Rama(scion of Kakutsa)"
"Killing deer and elephants, drinking forest-honey, seeing various rivers, he would not remember of sovereignty"
"Let the granary and the treasury belonging to me be sent to Rama residing in the
uninhabited forest."
"Rama can spend his exile happily, by performing sacrificial rite in holy places and disbursing appropriate gifts, along with sages living in the forest "
"The mighty armed Bharata will rule Ayodhya. Let the glorious Rama be sent alog with all objects of enjoyment"
While Dasartha was speaking thus, fear drew near Kaikeyi. Her mouth too also got
parched. her voice also got choked.
Feeling depressed and apprehensive, with her mouth getthing parched and her face
turned towards the king, Kaikeyi spoke as follows:
"Bharata will not accept the kingdom, which will become uninhabited, hollow and
which will be absolutely unenjoyable like wine, quaffed of its spiriteous part, Oh noble soul!"
While Kaikeyi who has cast off her shame was thus uttering th emost cruel words,
King Dasaratha spoke these words to that lady with large eyes:
Having charged me with a burden, Oh hostile woman, why do you prick me while I am
carrying it? Why did you not check before(while asking the boons by putting a condition that Rama should not be allowed to take anything with him) the deed(of sending troups etc with Rama) in the begining itself, Oh the vulgar woman!"
Doubly enraged in hearing this angry question of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi the beautiful
woman replied to the king as follows:
Spoken to as above, king Dasaratha uttered only a word "Shame!". The entire people there were ashamed. But Kaikeyi did not perceive it"
There, the aged and the upright chief minister siddhartha by name who was highly
esteemed by the king, spoke to Kaikeyi these words:
"Asamanja the evil-minded, catching hold of children playing in the street and
throwing them in the waters of saryu river, took delight in it"
By watching him, all the citizens were angry and spoke to the king, "choose either to keep yourself Asamanja alone or to preserve us, Oh the promoter of the state!"
Thereupon the king said to them, "For what reason is this fear? Duly asked by the
king, those people also replied these words:
"He obtains incomparable delight by throwing, through stupidity, our playing
children in sarayu river in a whirled state of mind."
Hearing the words of those poeple, that king abandoned the son repugnant to his
subjects, in a bid to do good to them.
Arranging immediately to place him along with his wife together with the
paraphrenalia (like utensils, implements etc) in a vehicle, the king instructed his persons thus: "He should be exiled for life."
Roaming in all directions as though he has done sinful deeds, he ransacked mountain passes, by taking a basket and a shovel.
"The highly righteous King Sagara abandoned Asamanja for perpetration sinful deeds as above. But, what sin Rama has done, for which he was debarred in this way?"
We do not indeed perceive any fault in Rama. It is as difficult to find a taint in him as in a new moon.
"Or if you see any fault in Rama, Oh Kaikeyi you tell about it now correctly. Then, Rama will be exiled."
As it is contradictory to righteousness to abandon one who is guilty and who is
devoted to a good path, it would consume the splendour of even Indra (the ruler of gods) "Oh, Kaikeyi! Hence, there is no need of impeding the royal fortune of Rama. Oh, lady with a charming face! Even blame from the public should be taken care of by you."
Hearing the words of Siddhartha, king Dasaratha spoke to Kaikeyi in the most
tiresome tone, with a voice choked with deep anguish, as follows.
"Oh, the sinful being! Do you not agree with these words of Siddhartha? By resorting to the path of the deplorable, you with a bad behaviour, are not alive to my interests or to your own. Your action is deprived of a righteous path."
"I am accompanying Rama now, by abandoning my kingdom, happiness and wealth. You
enjoy the kingdom for a long time, happily together with Bharata the King."We need not wait for any invitation or wedding card or call for this marriage, as all are welcome, equally and individually. 
Let us go there straight, without any introductions and preliminaries.
On which day the king Dasharatha made the impressive cow donations or, initiatory rites, on that day alone the valiant Yudhaajit 
turned up. 
Yudhaajit, the son of Kekaya king and the brother of Kaikeyi, thus the direct maternal uncle of Bharata, having seen and 
asked after the wellbeing of Dasharatha said this to him. 
The ruler and king of Kekaya, viz., my father and your father-in-law, has affectionately asked after the wellbeing of all, 
and in whose wellbeing you are interested at my place, they are all hale and healthy as of now... 
Oh, Raghu's legatee, oh, best king, my father and the king of Kekaya is interested to see my sister Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, 
and for that reason I am sent to Ayodhya... 
"Oh, lord of the land, in Ayodhya I have heard that you went to Mithila along with your sons for their marriages, and wishing 
to see my sister's son Bharata I promptly travelled here..." Thus Yudhaajit told Dasharatha. 
Then king Dasharatha on seeing the adorable guest who arrived in his presence, and who is a merited one for adoration, Dasharatha 
adored Yudhaajit well, with full observances. 
Then on taking rest for that night along with his noble-minded sons, and again on getting up in the next morning, and on 
performing morning-observances as a duty-bound king, Dasharatha arrived at the hall of Vedic-ritual, keeping the sages in 
his forefront. 
Rama arrived at his father together with all of his brothers, keeping sage Vashishta and other eminent-saint ahead of them, 
on an opportune and appropriate hour called 'Victory...' and all the bridegrooms are adorned with all kinds of jewellery 
appropriate for the wedding time, and all have performed the auspicious ceremony for marriage-thread, conducted prior to 
the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent 
to marriage ceremony. 
Then that godly sage Vashishta on going from Vedic-ritual hall to marriage hall said this to Janaka, "Oh, best one among 
best people, oh, king Janaka, having performed the auspicious marriage-thread ceremony, Dasharatha along with his sons is 
looking forward for the donor... 
"In marriages all thepuruSaartha-s, the component values of life, namely rightness, riches, 
revelries, and results of final release will be occurring only if the benefactor and beneficiary meet, isn't it. Hence let 
king Dasharatha come, and then on actualising this best marriage you too will be doing your best devoir as royal priest... 

Janaka is not just a decidedly valiant king but he is the profound knower of probity also, besides being an unreservedly 
generous king, hence he has already made all arrangements, and when he is spoken in this way by Vashishta that king replied 
this sentence to that right honourable Vashishta. 
Who is that doorman that prevents your entry? Or, for whose orders you all await with a bated breath? Do you hesitate in 
your own house, or what? This kingdom is as good as yours... isn't so... 
Oh, eminent-saint Vashishta, on absolutely performing the auspicious ceremony for the marriage-thread, and thereby tying 
thread-band at wrists my daughters have already arrived, and they are at the base of the Altar of Fire, like the irradiant 
jets of flames of radiant fire... 
"I am already ready and awaiting for you remaining at this Altar of Fire. Let everything be done indeed without any deterrents. 
What for the king Dasharatha is dawdling..." So said Janaka to Vashishta. 
On hearing that sentence of Janaka, then Dasharatha started towards marriage hall, and then he started to enter his sons 
one by one, four in all, into marriage hall along with all of the assemblages of sages. 
Then that king from Videha bloodline, Janaka, said in this way to Vashishta, "Oh, the knower of punctilios, oh, Brahma-sage, 
oh, masterly sage, along with other sages you make happen all of the marriage ceremonies of Rama, the rejoicer of the world..." 
Thus Janaka spoke to Vashishta. 
Thus said, that godly sage Vashishta on saying, "so be it," to Janaka, embarked on arranging Altar of Fire keeping sage 
Vishvamitra and the virtuous sage Shataananda afore of him, and that sage with great ascesis, Vashishta, has arranged an 
Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. 
Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with 
just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, 
and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled 
wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk 
etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and 
he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. 
Then that great resplendent and eminent-saint Vashishta neatly overlaid even-sized sacred grass on that Altar of Fire synchronising 
with Vedic-chants, and on preparing Ritual-fire by rubbing two wooden sticks, calledaraNi, he placed that fire in the pit of Altar, which is aflame now, and then reverently and in tune with the Vedic-hymns he 
effused oblational liquids into that Altar of Fire, with short-handled and long-handled wooden scoops. 
Then that king Janaka led forth Seetha, who by now is decorated with every variety of bridal jewellery, and on positioning 
her en face Raghava in the presence of Altar of Fire, then Janaka addressed Rama who is the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's 
rejoice. 
"This is Seetha, my daughter, she acquits herself in whatever duty you undertake. Take her wishfully, let safeness betide 
you, take her palm into your palm..." 
Here Sita stands, my daughter fair, / The duties of thy life to share. / Take from her father, take thy bride, / Join hand 
to hand, and bliss betide! / - Ralph T. H. Griffith
The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanzaiyam, mama, 
tava'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at 
some of them.
Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told "take her...' Why thisiyami.e., "this" It is explained as below:
Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking 
at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers
Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?
Janaka: Because she is 'Seetha '
Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion...

Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel 
of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because 
of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol 
of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally 
tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under 
your feet...vedaaham etam puruSham mahaantam aadityavarNam tamasaH parastaat |if the Supreme Person beyond 
darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soulaham vedmi mahaatmaanam 
raamam satyaparaakramam - bala -likewise you shall knowiyam siitaa,for she is somebody to match you... 
have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s
Rama: Why not every bit of it...  you name, it I tell it
Janaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?
Adi Shankara's commentary: There are three letters that denote the Absolutesa, ta, yam; and the syllableiionsatis for easy pronunciation. The lettersaindicates immortality and the wordtamortality, and the syllableyamconditions and bridges both the above 'Ramanuja comment:The lettersatis immortality and the lettertiis mortality andyamconditions both, hencesattiyamis indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness 'Madhvaacaaryasays:sat, delivered immortal souls;tiyet to be delivered bounded souls;yamboth the delivered and bounded souls.
Janaka: Seetha is thatyamthe conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal,setu - eSa 
setu iti vidhaaraNaathe presiding deity ofcetana-acetanadynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu 
Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion,raaghavatve bhavet siitaa...It is said 
in yet another scripture,yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii 
ca tathaa iishvarii ||'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller 
of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha 
alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earthratna-garbhaaand you are 
a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given goldanargham api maaNikyam 
hemaashrayam apekShateotherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning 
you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or 
more Ravana-s
Rama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi
Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is 
manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also,ayam iishvariiis manifest asiyamthis girl... fromsiitaafurrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, 
and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above 
mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours
Rama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?
Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge 
from earth, a lovely act for you.
Rama: Then whymama sutaa...she can be fostered in any orphanage
Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not 
just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming 
ofvi-deha...it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background 
and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her asmama sutaa'my daughter ' And many, many 
kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to 
counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; 
a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha,iyam siitaa 
mama sutaaas some ignoramus and insignificant dullards
Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey
Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her inkanyaa-daana'bestowal of bride ' because your 
marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... 
that is why I tellpratiicCha enaaam' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me;bhadram te'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yourspaaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa' you take her palm

incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may 
come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby
And we now proceed to the human level import of this verse.
Janaka: 'iyam"this girl" who has ---mugdhamanoharamanoj~namohanaatmakasukumaarasoundaryalaavaNyaadau--- 
a beauty par excellence ;
so,iyam"this one" is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started 
towards Mithila;
hence,iyam"this one alone" is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva's bow, and 
whom you are envisioningpraasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH'on verandas of multistoried 
buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you ' during these days of your stay 
in Mithila....
Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral 
conclusion...
Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my 
daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that 
hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so,iyam siitawas the only intention of yours when lifting that bow...
Rama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans
Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I saidmama sutaa'my daughter ' when it is saidmahataa 
tapasaa raama...' by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama.. what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and 
fostered this girl with much better ascesis , and even protected her from warring factions ; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, 
why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal 
enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I saidsahadharmacarii tava' she will be in toe with your duties'
tava dharmasahacarii' whatever is your duty that duty become hers too '..
Rama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even
Janaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her... I have not saidsiitaam dadaami'I am donating Seetha ' but I saidpratiicCha enaam'take her, take her back ' or else, she will exit as she came 
and unfulfilled will be your mission... it is up to you to decide.... no compulsion whatsoever...
Rama: Then, let her take hold of my arrow and walk with me round the Altar of Fire, because, for Kshatriya-s that is the 
custom...
Janaka: I know, I know, but this marriage does not fit into any of the eight kinds of marriage prescribed for humans... 
hence I carefully saidpaaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa' take her palm into your palm '
Rama: This marriage does not fit into any category! Then why this marriage at all!
Janaka: To be in tune with this world's tradition... however, this marriage technically comes under the category ofpraajaapatya
Rama: So, you adjusted the rule books... then why me, let her take my hand...
Janaka: The enjoyer has to grab the object of enjoyment, not vice versa... take her now andbhadram teand 'be 
blest '
Janaka:iyam- 'this' girl is a simple match to you who broke the bow of Shiva;
siitaa' born in furrow' a motherless girl, hence, kindly be merciful towards her;
mama sutaa' my daughter ' rather, a poor fellow's daughter; where I have always been engaged in rituals and ceremonies, 
thereby I may not have brought her up properly, and thereby if she does talk rashly or behave oddly, like an ill-bred girl, 
kindly tolerate and correct her;
sahadhrmacarii ivawhereivais ' like ' just take her like your 'custom-bound consort ' and let her 
be useful in ceremonies and rituals, though not for pleasure trips and excursions ';
pratiicCha enaam'take her ' where the bridegrooms usually woo, court and date girls, send many messages to her 
parents asking for that girl in marriage; but, this girl being an uncommon one, I am begging you to take her;
paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaayou take her hand as she is hesitating to take your hand, for your hand is strong enough 
to break an unbreakable bow, she is fearing to take your hand, lest her arm too will be broken;
bhadram te'be blest ' when you honour our appeal
And there are many, many more shades of meanings derived from this verse, but all culminate to say - 'you two are made for 
each other '
"She who is prosperous and husband-devout, will always be abiding you like your own shadow..." So saying that king Janaka 
then poured forth water into the palms of Rama, which is sanctified with hymns. 
Then there occurred great flower-showers from firmament, while sages and gods staying in firmament have exclaimed, "nice... 
fine..." to the drumbeats of heavenly drums. 
On handing over his daughter Seetha who is duly sanctified with sanctified waters, King Janaka is completely overwhelmed 
with exhilaration for the successful performance of his bit as a father and he said this. 
Come on, Lakshmana, safe betides you... say yes to Urmila, the one who is decided by me to be given to you... take her 
palm into yours... lapse not the time... 
Janaka having said to Lakshmana that way, he also addressed Bharata, "Oh, Bharata, the delight of Raghu-s, take Maandavi's 
palm into your palm... 
That honourable king of Mithila even said to Shatrughna, "oh, dextrous Shatrughna, take the palm of Shrutakiirti into yours... 

"Oh, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna ... you all are tender-hearted, well-behaved and well-intentioned brothers from 
Kakutstha lineage... without lapse of time take up other ceremonies..." So said Janaka to bridegrooms. 
All the four bridegrooms are palminpalmed with all the four brides, paying heed to Janaka's words, and abiding in Vashishta's 
orchestration of Vedic hymns and procedures. 
On performing circumambulations along with their wives around the Ritual-fire, and around the Altar of Fire, and that way, 
around king Janaka, the awarder of wives, and around sages as well for they conducted the marriages well, those great-souled 
bridegrooms that have emerged from Raghu's dynasty on performing further deeds of ritual consistent with custom as directed 
by Vashishta, they are all wed. 
There occurred rich and highly dazzling flower showers from firmament, and that ambience is filled with the drumbeats of 
divine drums and with vocal and instrumental music, and promenades of apsara-s danced, and even the gandharva-s sang tunefully, 
and because it is the marriage of celebrated bridegrooms from Raghu's dynasty, such a charming spectacle is envisioned.. 

In this kind of ongoingness of harmonious music of vocal, instrumental and that of dancers, those great resplendent brothers 
married their wives on circumabulating the Ritual-fire fire thrice. 
Then those legatees of Raghu went to their visitatorial-palace with their wives, followed by king Dasharatha along with 
the assemblages of sages, kinfolks, queens and wives included, and Dasharatha feasted his eyes on sons and daughter-in-laws. 
He who is well-versed in Veda-s, who is a gatherer of all scholars, riches and 
			forces as well, a foreseer and a great resplendent one, also one who is esteemed 
			by urbanites and countrymen alike, one who is a top-speeded chariot-warrior among 
			the emperors of Ikshwaku kings, one who has performed many Vedic rituals, a virtuous 
			one, a great controller, a saint-like kingly sage, one who he is renowned in all 
			the three worlds, a mighty one with all his enemies eradicated, nevertheless who 
			has friends, one who conquered all his senses, one who is similar to Indra, or 
			Kubera on earth with his wealth, accumulations and other possessions, he that 
			king Dasharatha while dwelling in the city of Ayodhya protected the world, like 
			Manu, the foremost protector of mankind. 
He that truth-abiding king, who adheres to the three-fold virtues rules the vast 
			of that kingdom from that best city Ayodhya, as Indra rules heaven from his capital 
			Amaravati. 
In that best city Ayodhya all are exuberant yet virtuous ones, and scholars are 
			variously learned ones, people are satisfied with their own riches, they have 
			no greed, and they advocate truthfulness alone. 
None with meagre accumulations is there in that great city and no householder 
			is there without unearned means, and without cows, horses, monies or cereals and 
			who could not sustain his family. 
None can see a lustful person, or a miser or a cruel one anywhere in that Ayodhya, 
			along with nondescripts or non-believers, for there are no such persons. 
All the ladies and gentlemen in that city are virtuous in mind, self-controlled 
			ones, they are all self-satisfied like great saints, and both in their conduct 
			and character they are blameless. 
In that city none is there without his earrings, headgear, or garlands, none is 
			an enjoyer of lowly things, or misses his regular oil-baths, or with an un-creamed 
			body with sandalwood paste or with other body cream, or with an un-perfumed physique. 
			
There is none who is famsihed, an uncharitable one in his nature, one with an 
			undecorated body with ornaments like bracelets or chest plates, and there is none 
			without a heart. 
There is none someone who is without sacrificial fires, and none without performing 
			sacrificial rituals, and none is low in living; neither an immoral, nor a bastard 
			nor even a thief, can be found in Ayodhya. 
The sense-controlled scholarly Vedic Brahmans are always engaged in their rituals, 
			and they donate the education of Vedas to their students, as well practice their 
			own, and while receiving donations they are principle-minded. 
There is no atheist, no liar, and none is less learnt in Veda-s, and no one is 
			found to be jealous, or disabled, or unscholarly person. 
None can be found anywhere in Ayodhya without the knowledge of the six ancillaries 
			of Veda-s like astrology, prosody, grammar etc., none a non-performer of the prescribed 
			rituals, and none a non-donor in thousands, thus none with a saddened heart, turmoil 
			in mind or agonised in will is there. 
Whoever it may be, either a gentleman or a lady, none is without wealth, even 
			none without elegance or devoid of devotion to their king, and it is impossible 
			to see suchlike person in Ayodhya. 
In the four-caste system, from the first caste to the last, everyone is a worshipper 
			of deities and guests and everyone is also faithful, illustrious, valiant, and 
			each one is a brave one. 
Longevity is there for all of the people, all are with virtuosity and truthfulness, 
			and they lived in that best city along with their sons, grandsons and their ladies. 
			
The warrior class Kshatriya-s is turned towards the Brahmans, the scholarly class, 
			for intellectual and religious support. The trading class, Vaisya-s, is the follower 
			of the Kshatriya-s, the ruling class, for the state's economy is dependent on 
			the rulership. And the fourth one, Shuudra-s, the working class, while performing 
			its own duties, is always working for the other castes. 
That city is well protected by that king from Ikshwaku dynasty namely Dasharatha, 
			like Manu, the foremost king of mankind in earlier times. 
That city Ayodhya is replete with firebrand like skillful warriors that are intolerant 
			of insults, and who have prosecuted their education in archery, chariot-wars, 
			swordplay etc. and with them it is like a cave replete with lions. 
That city is full with best horses born in countries like Kaambhoja, Baahlika, 
			Vanaayu, and also in river-bed counties, which are like the horse of Indra namely 
			ucChaishrava. 
Born in Vindhya Mountains, and also from Himalayan regions, mighty are the elephants 
			fully vigorous and fattened ones, and most powerful in their strength and each 
			in similitude is a huge mountain. 
High bred from the classes of Airavata, the Elephant of Lord Indra, and from Mahapadma, 
			Anjana and Vamana, too...are the elephants  
That city is always full with vigorous and mountain like elephants bred mainly 
			from three classes viz., Bhadra, Mandra and Mriga. And inter-bred among these 
			three main classes are Bhadra-Mandra, Mandra-Mriga, Bhadra-Mriga and the like. 
			
While residing in which city King Dasharatha ruled the world that city is further 
			fortified up to two more yojana-s outside city, true to its namea yodhya, an un-assailable one. 
In which city the great resplendent and admirable king Dasharatha resided, he 
			ruled the world from that city with silenced enemies, like the moon governing 
			the stars. 
With gorgeous arches, castle-door-bars and with amazingly built houses that city 
			is magnificent and auspicious one, and full with thousands of provincial kings 
			too, and king Dasharatha, a coequal of Indra, indeed ruled that city which is 
			true to its name. Rama, upon arriving at the Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, became overwhelmed by emotion upon seeing its beauty, which reminded him of Seetha's face. He expressed his distress to Lakshmana, lamenting the abduction of Seetha and the anguish he felt due to their separation.

Rama described the beauty of Pampa Lake and its surrounding forests, filled with diverse flowers and vibrant trees. He expressed his sorrow at the thought of Seetha being separated from him in such a splendid place. The sight of birds, flowers, and the gentle breeze only intensified his longing for Seetha.

He compared the spring season to a fiery ordeal, burning him with the memories of Seetha. Rama expressed his belief that Seetha, with her youth and beauty, would be unable to bear separation from him. He dwelled on memories of their time together, including the sounds of birds that used to bring joy to both of them.

Rama's anguish grew as he imagined Seetha's suffering and the challenges she might face without him. He longed for her company, lamenting the loss of happiness and purpose in his life without her by his side. The sight of animals and birds in the forest only served to remind him of Seetha and deepen his sorrow.

Despite his grief, Lakshmana urged Rama to control himself and find the strength to continue their quest to find and rescue Seetha. He reminded Rama of the power of determination and the need to overcome despair to achieve their goal.

Encouraged by Lakshmana's words, Rama resolved to push aside his sadness and regain his courage. With renewed determination, he pressed forward, accompanied by Lakshmana, towards the next phase of their journey.

As they journeyed on, the sight of Rama and Lakshmana struck fear into the hearts of the monkeys nearby, who fled in terror towards the safety of Sage Matanga's hermitage.

In summary, Rama's lamentation at the beauty of Pampa Lake and the surrounding forest is interwoven with his longing for Seetha and his determination to rescue her, with Lakshmana's support and encouragement.Placing his hallowed hands together on his head (as a mark of salutation), Bharata
the enhancer of Kaikeyi's happiness, spoke to the truly brave Rama, his elder brother (as
follows):
"You gave this kingdom to me and treated my mother's words respectfully. As you gave
it to me then, in the same way I am giving it to you again.
I cannot carry this heavy burden anymore than a young ox would sustain a load,
carried forward by a strong bull all alone."
"I think this venerable point in the form of administration of the kingdom is
difficult to be controlled, as a broken dam, seeping from its cracks when breached mammoth stream
of water.
O hero, the annihilator of enemies! I am not able to follow your path, any more than
a donkey would follow the gallop of a horse or a crow would take up the chase of a wild goose."
"O mighty armed king! How a tree planted in the back yard of one's own house, even
though grown big and difficult to climb with a huge trunk and large branches, does not yield fruits
but dries up after flowering, he who planted it would not enjoy the fruit for which it was planted.
This is the analogy applied to you, if you, as a Master, would not indeed rule over us, your
servants. You can understand the meaning."
"O Rama! Today, let the world see you when crowned, like the sun with its glowing
splendour, shining brilliantly at noon.
May you relax and wake-up too, to the sounds of an ensemble of musical instruments,
the tinkling of ornaments strung with tiny bells and worn around the waist and anklets as well as
sweet invocation of songs.
Look after, you, lordship of world here, as long as the stellar sphere revolves and
so far as the earth is spread out."
Hearing the words of Bharata, Rama who conquered the cities of adversaries, accepted
his words saying "Be it so" and sat on an auspicious seat.
Thereafter, on instructions from Shatrughna, skilled barbers with gentle hands who
can do their work with a good speed, encircled Rama all round.
Bharata, having bathed first, the mighty Lakshmana, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys and
Vibhishana the king of demons took bath. Rama had his matted locks disentangled and bathed. He
stood there, shining with splendour, adorned with picturesque garlands, smeared with sandal pastes
of various colours and clothed in costly raiment.
Shatrughna, the valiant and charming man, the promoter of Ikshvaku dynasty made
arrangements for personal adornment of Rama and Lakshmana.
Then, all the noble-minded widows of Dasaratha indeed themselves personally adorned
Seetha beautifully.
Thereupon, the delightful Kausalya, who was affectionate of her sons, adorned with
zeal all the wives of monkeys.
Later, on the orders of Shatrughna, the charioteer by name Sumantra made his
appearance, yoking chariot to horses which were completely beautiful in all respects.
Seeing the charming chariot, which emitted immaculate splendour like that of the
sun, standing before him, the mighty armed Rama, the conqueror of hostile cities, ascended it.
Sugreeva and Hanuma, having splendour similar to that of Indra the lord of
celestials, after taking their bat, wore beautiful raiment as well as sparkling ear rings and
started.
Endowed with all types of ornaments as well as charming ear-rings, those wives of
Sugreeva together with Seetha moved out, longing as they were, to see the city.
In Ayodhya, the ministers of king Dasaratha, having placed the priest in their
front, planned everything meaningfully.
Ashoka, Vijaya and Siddhartha, with a great concern, discussed about Rama's
advancement and the prosperity of the City.
"You ought to do auspiciously whatever is required for the coronation of the
great-souled Rama, worthy of victory."
Advising the priest in this way, all those ministers quickly started from the city,
with an intention to see Rama.
The faultless Rama, mounting the excellent chariot, as Indra ascended the chariot
yoked to green-coloured horses, sallied forth to the city.
Bharata took up the reins. Shatrughna held the parasol on Rama's head. Lakshmana
winnowed a fan. Vibhishana, the king of demons standing nearby, held a white fan, shining
brilliantly like the moon.
Then, in the sky, groups of sages, celestials along with troop of the Maruts, the
host of the gods, praised Rama and sweet reverberation was heard.
Thereupon, Sugreeva, the foremost of monkeys, possessing a great splendor, mounted
an elephant named Shatrunjaya, looking like a mountain.
Assuming human forms and adorned with all types of ornaments, monkeys sallied forth,
mounting on mine thousand elephants.
Rama, the foremost among men, accompanied by sounds of conches buzzing in the ears
and sounds of kettle-drums, proceeded to the city of Ayodhya, having a series of palaces.
Then, the people of Ayodhya saw Rama, the chariot warrior, having a beautiful form,
arriving on a chariot, with attendants walking in front.
Felicitating Rama and greeted in reciprocation by Rama, they followed the great
souled Rama, who was surrounded by his brothers.
Surrounded by ministers, brahamanas and other citizens, Rama shone with his own
brilliance, like the moon among the stars.
That Rama drove, surrounded by musicians having musical instruments cymbals and
Swastika-musical instruments in their hands walking in front and uttering auspicious songs.
Men with grains of rice mixed with turmeric and thereby appearing gold in colour,
cows, maidens along with brahmanas having balls of sweets in their hands, walked in front of
Rama.
Then, Rama narrated about his friendship established with Sugreeva, the power of
Hanuma and the great act of monkeys to his ministers.
Hearing the well-known achievement monkeys and the commonly known strength of the
demons, the citizens of Ayodhya were astonished.
Then, Rama spoke to his counselors about his meeting with Vibhishana. After
recounting it, the resplendent Rama entered Ayodhya crowded with happy and rejoiced people,
together with the monkeys.
Then, the citizens hoisted flags on every house. Rama reached the beautiful palace,
paternal occupied by Ikshvaku kings.
Approaching and entering the palace of the great-souled father, Rama the prince
offered salutation to Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi and spoke the following sweet and meaningful
words to Bharata, the foremost among the righteous:
"Give this great palace of mine which looks excellent with Ashoka garden and
consisting of pearls and cat's eye-gems to Sugreeva for his stay."
Hearing those words of Rama, Bharata having a true prowess, holding Sugreeva by his
hand, entered that house.
Thereupon, some men as ordered by Shatrughna, quickly brought oil lamps, beds as
also mats and entered the house.
Bharata of great splendour spoke to Sugreeva as follows: "O capable person! Order
the messengers to make arrangements for Rama's coronation."
Sugreeva then gave four golden jars encrusted with jewels, to four leaders of
monkeys.
"O monkeys! Get ready in such a way that you await my orders tomorrow at dawn, with
your water-jars filled with water from the four oceans respectively."
The great souled monkeys, resembling elephants and going speedily like eagles, thus
ordered by Sugreeva, leapt quickly into the sky.
Jambavan, Hanuma, a monkey called Vegadarshi and Rishabha brought water-jars filled
with water. They brought water from five hundred rivers with those jars.
Thereafter, the energetic SusheNa brought a jar, adorned with all types of precious
stones, filled with water from the eastern sea.
Rishabha brought water quickly from the southern sea in a golden jar, covered with
some stems of red sandal-wood tree.
Gavaya, having a pace as rapid as wind, brought cool water from the western ocean,
in a large jar set with jewels.
That virtuous Nala, who vied with Garuda (the king of birds) and the wind-god in
prowess, and who was endowed with all good qualities, swiftly brought water form the northern
sea.
Then, Shatrughna, accompanied by the counsellors, reported to Vasishta, their chief
priest and his friends, about that water intended for Rama's coronation brought by those foremost
of monkeys.
The elderly Vasistha, with diligence, along with other brahmins on his side,
prevailed upon Rama duly to occupy along with Seetha, on a seat made of precious stones.
Vasishta, Vamadeva, Kashyapa, Katyayana, Suyajna, Gautama and Vijaya consecrated
Rama the tiger among men, with clear and fragrant water, as the eight Vasus*
Vasishta and others, with much delight got him consecrated first, with brahmanas
officiating as priests and by virgins, ministers, warriors, as well as merchants sprinkling the sap
of all kinds of medicinal herbs, with the four gods the guardians of the worlds, standing in the
air and with all the gods assembled there, sprinkling the sap on Rama.
With which crown, long ago, Manu the emperor was adorned while he was consecrated
and with which, the kings followed in his line were successively adorned while they were coronated,
that crown studded with precious jewels, fashioned by Brahma at the beginning of creation and
dazzling with splendour, being kept according to practice on a throne adorned with many kinds of
precious stones in the council-hall, studded with gold, graced with abundant riches, decorated and
shiningly made with most charming jewels of various kinds, and thereafter Rama duly adorned by that
crown as well as jewels by the great-souled Vasishta and other priests officiating at the
coronation-ceremony.
Shatrughna held over him, a white and charming parasol; Sugreeva the king of
monkeys, a white whisk and vibhishana the lord of demons, another whisk shining like the moon.
Encouraged by Indra, the lord of celestials, the wind-god presented to Rama, a
golden garland consisting of a hundred lotuses and which looked shining brilliantly.
Induced by Indra, the wind-god presented to Rama the king, a chain of pearls,
adorned with gems and endowed with several types of precious stones.
On that occasion of the coronation-ceremony of the intelligent Rama, who was
well-deserving it, the celestial-musicians among the celestials gracefully sang and troupes of
Apsaras (celestial nymphs) danced.
On the occasion of that merriment of coronation to Rama, the earth was bearing a
rich crop, the trees were laden with fruits and fragrant flowers.
Rama the foremost among men, first gave away to Brahmanas, a hundred thousand horses
and cows that have lately calved as well as a hundred bulls.
Rama again gave to Brahmanas, thirty crores of gold coins, all kinds of very costly
jewels and raiment.
Rama gave to Sugreeva, a beautiful chaplet, studded with plenty of gems, looking
like a beam of sun-light.
The joyful Rama presented to Angada, the son of Vali, a bracelet worn on upper arm,
conspicuously studded with cat's eye gems and adorned with jewels and gems.
Rama presented to Seetha, an excellent string of pearls, furnished with superior
gems, shining like a beam of moon-light; two clean and beautiful raiment and lovely ornaments.
Looking towards Hanuma the monkey, Seetha, daughter of Janaka, having taken off the
pearl-string from her neck, repeatedly caught the glimpse of all the monkeys and her husband.
Looking at her, Rama who was acquainted with the gesture of another spoke to Seetha
as follows: "Dear Seetha! Give the pearl-necklace to a person, with whom you are pleased and in
whom the following viz. sharpness, firmness, renown, dexterity, competence, modesty, prudence,
virility, prowess and intelligence are ever present."
The black-eyed Seetha gave that pearl necklace to Hanuma. Hanuma, the foremost among
the monkeys, by wearing that necklace, which was as white as a heap of moonlight-beams, shone
brilliantly as a mountain silvered by a white cloud.
All the elder ones among the monkeys and others, who were foremost among the moneys,
were honoured suitably with raiment and ornaments.
Thereafter, Rama the tormentator of enemies, having thought over, presented articles
according to their inclinations, to Mainada, Dvivida and Nila.
Rama, who was unwearied in action, then suitably honoured Vibhishana, Sugreeva,
Hanuma, Jamabavan and all other eminent monkeys with desired objects and abundant gifts. All of
them went back, delighted in mind even as they had come.
Thereafter, all those excellent great souled monkeys, offering their salutation to
Rama and getting permission from him, returned to Kishkindha.
Having seen Rama's coronation-ceremony, Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, after getting
honoured by Rama, entered the city of Kishkindha.
The righteous and the renowned king Vibhishana too, after obtaining the treasure of
his race (kingdom of demons), followed by those foremost of demons, returned to Lanka.
That renowned Rama, of a very generous nature, having destroyed his enemies and
ruling the entire kingdom, enjoyed it with a great delight. Rama, affectionate of righteousness,
spoke to Lakshmana, the knower of righteousness (as followers):
"O Lakshmana, the knower of what is right! Rule with me, this earth, as ruled by the
earlier kings, with the help of an army. Installed in the office of Prince Regent, bear like me,
the burden (of sovereignty), which was borne by our forefathers."
When Lakshmana did not give his consent, even though being repeatedly entreated in
all ways, nay even being appointed to the office of Prince Regent, the great-souled Rama thereupon
consecrated Bharata.
Rama propitiated the gods by performing Paundarika, Ashvamedha, Vajapeya and other
sacrifices many times.
Having enjoyed the kingship for ten thousand years, Rama performed a hundred
horse-sacrifices, in which good horses were sacrificed and numerous gifts bestowed.
That Rama, having his long arms reaching down his knees, having a broad chest and
glorious, ruled this earth with Lakshmana as his companion.
Obtaining a very great kingdom the righteous Rama propitiated the almighty with many
kinds of sacrifices, with the team-work of his sons, brothers and relatives.
While Rama was ruling the kingdom, there were no widows to lament, nor there was no
danger from wild animals, nor any fear born of diseases.
The world was bereft of thieves and robberies. No one felt worthless nor did old
people perform obsequies concerning youngsters.
Every creature felt pleased. Every one was intent on virtue. Turning their eyes
towards Rama alone, creatures did not kill one another.
While Rama was ruling the kingdom, people survived for thousands of years, with
thousands of their progeny, all free of illness and grief.
While Rama ruled the kingdom, the talks of the people centered round Rama, Rama and
Rama. The world became Rama's world.
The trees there were bearing flowers and fruits regularly, without any injury by
pests and insects. The clouds were raining in time and the wind was delightful to the touch.
Brahmins (the priest-class), Kshatriyas (the warrior-class), Vaishyas (the class of
merchants and agriculturists), Shudras (the servant-class) were performing their own duties,
satisfied with their own work and bereft of any greed. While Rama was ruling, the people were
intent on virtue and lived without telling lies.
All the people were endowed with excellent characteristics. All were engaged in
virtue. Rama was engaged in the kingship thus for one thousand years.

shore of the ocean.
Both Maina and Dvivida the distinguished monkeys there moved in all directions
through that army, for the purpose of vigilance.
After the army was settled at the sea-shore, Rama spoke to Lakshmana who was by his
side (as follows):
"It is so said that sorrow gets vanished at the passing of time. But my agony of not
seeing my beloved is getting increased every day."
"There is no anguish for me that my beloved is at a distance, nor that she was taken
away. Her age is indeed passing away. Only about this, I am repenting."
"Oh, wind! Flow from the side of my beloved. Touch her and touch me too. It is
through you that I get a contact of her limbs. It is through moon that I get a contact of her
eyes."
"That darling being carried away; might have cried "Oh, Lord!" Seeking for help.
That thought is like poison gulped by me, hovering in my stomach and scorching my limbs."
"My body is scorching night and day, by the fire of passion, holding fuel of my
separation from her and my thoughts of her flaring into shimmering flames."
"Oh, Lakshmana! Diving deep into the sea without you, I shall fall asleep. This
flaming passion will not thus scorch me, lying down in water.
"It is enough for me, who is passionate, that Seetha with charming thighs and myself
are resting on one the same earth and on this fact I am able to survive."
"Even as a paddy-field without water survives, by getting wet from a neighboring
paddy-field under water, I also survive since I am hearing her as surviving.
"When shall I behold Seetha with charming hips, having long lotus-like eyes
flourishing as prosperity, by conquering the enemies?"
"When, gently raising her face looking like louts, with its beautiful teeth and
lips, shall I drink as a sick man the sovereign drink of remedy?"
"When will those breasts which are delightful close, bulging and quivering, looking
like palmary fruits, indeed press me?"
"She, with dark-cornered eyes, who has fallen into the midst of demons, is surely
not getting any defender, she resembling an orphan, though I am her support."
"How Seetha the daughter of King Janaka, my darling and Dasaratha's daughter-in-law
is sleeping among ogresses?"
"Seetha will come out, driving away (through my force) the unassailable demons, as
driving away black clouds by a digit of the moon, in autumn."
"Seetha, who by nature is slender, will undoubtedly become leaner further because of
her anguish, her abstinence from food and her adverse position of time and place."
"When shall I bring back Seetha, having lodged arrows in Ravana's chest and having
abandoned this mental agony?"
"When indeed Seetha the virtuous lady similar to the child of a celestial, with an
excited longing, will embrace my neck and release tears of joy?"
"When shall I thrillingly abandon this terrible anguish, born out of my separation
from Seetha so soon, as we abandon a soiled clothing?"
While that sagacious Rama was lamenting thus there, the sun, the weak-rayed due to
day-decline, approached the dusk.
Lakshmana consoled Rama who was overwhelmed with anguish, duly recollecting the
lotus-eyed Seetha. Thereafter, Rama worshipped the evening-twilight.Hearing the words of Hanuma, Rama the son of Dasaratha, having Lakshmana by his side, 
pressing that jewel on his bosom, began to weep.
Seeing that excellent jewel, Rama emaciated with grief, having his eyes filled with tears, 
spoke to Sugreeva as follows:
"Even as a cow, who is affectionate towards her offspring, gushes forth the milk (from 
her teats) due to her love at the very sight of her calf, so does my heart to melt through the sight 
of this excellent jewel."
"This excellent jewel was presented by my father-in-law to Seetha when she had become 
a bride and was tied to her head in such a way that it looked additionally beautifying."
"The jewel, which was found in the waters and recommended by the good, had been presented 
to him earlier by the intelligent Indra the lord of celestials, who was highly pleased in Yajna, a sacrificial 
rite (intended to propitiate him)."
"O gentle Sugreeva! Seeing now this excellent jewel, I am considering it as surely as 
obtaining the sight of my father as well as Janaka, the king of Videha."
"This jewel indeed looks splendid on the head of my beloved Seetha. By seeing this now, 
I am considering as though I obtained the sight of Seetha herself."
"O gentle one! Repeat again and again, what Seetha the daughter of Videha's king said 
to you, sprinkling me with your stream of words, like offering water to a thirsty person."
"O Lakshmana! What could be more painful than the fact that I am seeing this jewel found 
in waters, without the arrival of Seetha?"
"O gentle one! If Seetha can survive for a month, it means that she is surviving for 
long. O gentle one! Without that black-eyed Seetha, I cannot survive for even a moment."
"Take me too to that place where my beloved Seetha has been seen. I cannot halt even 
for a moment, after receiving the news of her location."
"How does Seetha, my virtuous wife with her charming limbs, who is very shy, stay all 
the time with demons who are terrific and cruel?"
"Her countenance, surely like autumnal moon, though liberated of darkness, screened 
by clouds, does not shine at present."
"O Hanuma! Tell me now, correctly what Seetha told you. I shall surely survive, by hearing 
her words, even as a sick man would with the help of a medicine."
"Tell me, what my beautiful consort, who is sweet-natured, and who utters sweet words, 
having fine hips and has been separated from me, said to you."Then while proceeding to Panchavati that Rahu's descendent came across a mammoth eagle with marvellous 
might in midway. 
On seeing such an eagle in the forest those two highly privileged brothers Rama and Lakshmana questioned 
it asking, "Who you are?" presuming it to be a demon. 
But that eagle with sweet ad soft words spoke to them as though to please them, "oh boy Rama know me 
as your father's friend." 
Accepting that bird as his father's friend Raghava revered it, and he that Rama then asked for that 
eagle's name and lineage. 
On hearing Rama's words that bird said about his ancestry and himself, and in doing so, that eagle also 
narrated the overall genesis of all beings. 
"Once upon a time there were lords of people, oh dextrous Raghava, and you may listen all about them 
from the beginning, while I narrate 
"Of them Kardama was there at first, and afterwards Sesha, and later Samshraya was there with many children 
and a vigorous one he was. Then Sthaanu, Mariichi, Atri, the great mighty one Kratu, Pulasthya, Angira, 
Pracheta and Pulah were there. And oh, Raghava, Daksha, Vivaswan were while the other name of Vivasvan 
is Arishtanemi, and lastly the great resplendent Kashyapa, was there as Prajapati.  
"Oh glorious Rama, there were sixty highly renowned daughters to Daksha, thus we hear. 
"Of them Kashyapa accepted eight slender-waisted daughters of Daksha Prajapati, namely Aditi, Diti, 
Danu, Kaalakaa and Taamra, Krodhavasha, also thus Manu and even Anala also as wives. 
"Then Kashyapa is gladdened and said to those young wives, "You all shall deliver sons similar to me 
and who can sustain the three worlds." 
"Oh, dextrous Rama, Aditi, Diti, Kaalakaa and Danu have agreed for that, but others became unheedful 
of Kashyapa's words. 
"Aditi gave birth to twelve Aditya-s, the Sun-gods, eight Vasu-s, the Terrestrials-gods, eleven Rudraa-s, 
the Fury-gods, and two Ashvinis, the medicine-gods, total thirty-three of them. 
"Oh, boy Rama, Diti gave birth to well-known Daitya-s, the so-called demons, and earlier this earth 
with forests and oceans belonged to them. 
"And oh, enemy-destroyer Rama, Danu gave birth to son Ashvagriiva or also called Hayagriiva, Horse-headed 
god, and Kaalakaa gave birth to Naraka and Kaalaka. 
"But Taamraa gave birth to five world renowned girls namely, Krounchi, Bhaasii, Shyenii, Dhritaraashtrii, 
and Shukii. 
"And from each of the five daughters of Taamraa in turn emanated are the other avian species, where 
Kraunchii gave birth to Uluuka-s, the owls, Bhasii-s gave birth to Bhaasaa-s, the vultures, and Shyenii 
gave birth to very sharp eagles and falcons, and then Dhritaraashtrii gave birth to swans and all other 
kinds of graceful water-birds. 
"Dhritaraashtrii gave birth even to Chakravaaka water-birds, and Shukii gave birth to a daughter Nata, 
and Nata's daughter is Vinata. 
"Oh, Rama, Krodhavasha gave birth to ten of her self-same daughters namely Mrigi, Mrigamanda, Hari, 
Bhadramanda, Maatangii, Sharduulii, Shweta, Surabhii, and like that to Surasa, who is embodied with 
all giftedness, and even to Kadruva. 
"Children Mrigi are all of the the deer, oh best of the best-men, Rama, and Mrigamnda's progeny is Riksha-s, 
Bears, a kind of antelope, and like that the Himalayan yak like species.
"Then Bhadramanda gave birth to the girl named Iravati and her son is elephant the great, Airaavata, 
the protector of world. 
"And Hari's offspring are lions and sagely/mighty monkeys, while Sharduulii gave birth to baboons and 
tigers. 
"Then Maatangi's childrenm are elephants, oh, best one among men, Rama, and Shweta gave birth to eight 
elephants that are at eight quarters of world, sustaining the world on their head. 
"Then, oh Rama, Surabhi gave birth to two daughters, one is named as illustrious Rohini, safe you 
be, and the other is Gandharvi. 
"Rohini gave birth to cows and other livestock, while Surasa gave birth to Naagaa-s, viz., many headed 
serpents, while Kadru gave birth to ordinary serpents. 
"Oh, the best among men Rama, the wife of great-soul Kashyapa, lady Manu procreated humans, Brahman--s, 
Kshatriya-s, Vyasya-s, and Shudra-s. 
"The Brahman-s emerged from face, the Kshatriya-s from chest, the Vyasya-s from two thighs, and the 
Shudra-s from two feet, thus we hear from the scriptures viz., Veda, i.e., Rig Veda Purusha Shuukta. 

"All the merited fruit-bearing trees are given birth by Anala, and now I will narrate about Vinata, 
the daughter's daughter of Shukii, and about Kadru, the sister of Surasa. 
"Kadru gave birth to a thousand-headed serpent who is the bearer of this earth, and Vinata gave birth 
to two sons namely Garuda and Aruna. 
"Oh enemy-destroyer Rama, I took birth from that Aruna, the charioteer of Sun, and my elder brother 
Sampati too, hence know me as Jatayu, the son of Shyenii. 
"Such as I am, I can be your helpmate at your residence if only you wish me to... oh, boy, this impassable 
forest is a beloved one to predators and demons, isn't it... as such I can take care of Seetha if you 
and Lakshmana go out..." Thus Jatayu said to Rama. 
Raghava revered Jatayu in his turn by gladly hugging and stood by him with his head bent, and that kind-natured 
Rama is indeed regardful of the friendship of his father with Jatayu that is repeatedly said by Jatayu. 

He that Rama took the princess from Mithila Seetha, and proceeded to Panchavati along with that very 
mighty bird and Lakshmana, as though to incinerate enemies, like fire that burns down grasshoppers. 
On hearing all of the words said by Vaidehi, in adoration of her husband, he who abides by virtue alone 
that Rama replied Janaki. 
"You have said beneficial, friendlily words that are seemlier to your disposition, oh, lady, which 
are apt to speak of your familial brought up, for you are the daughter of virtue-knowing Janaka. 
"What more shall I say, oh, lady, since it is said that 'a warrior handles a bow so that misery's tears 
cease to flow...' and this saying is iterated even by you... 
"Oh! Seetha, those shleterable sages of Dandaka forest have approached me sombrely on their own, and 
thus they came into my refuge... 
"Subsisting on fruits and tubers, living at all the time in forests those sages are not getting quietude, 
as they are scared by the demons with invidious deeds... 
"The sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are being eaten away by fiendish demons that subsist on human 
flesh, and while being eaten away like that those eminent Brahmans have said to me, "please come to 
our rescue..." 
"This way when I have heard the words voiced by them, I comforted them verbally and avouched this way, 
"Be gracious to me... you all... by which reason I am being addressed this way by this kind of eminent 
Brahmans, whom I should have actually addressed my self, this indeed is a dishonour for me... 
"Then I said before the Brahmans, "what shall I do?" All of them thus thronged and spoke this word. 

"Many of the guise changing demons are outrightly torturing us in Dandaka forest, hence in that context 
you shall protect us... 
"Those resistless carnivorous demons, oh, merited Rama, will descend exactly at the time of fire oblations, 
or on propitious times like full or new moons to persecute us... 
"We the ascetics being assaulted thus are aggrieved, and when we searched for a recourse you chanced 
as our ultimate course... 
"We by the efficacy of our ascesis are surely capable to eradicate those demons, but we do not wish 
to shorten the effect of our long earned merit of ascesis... 
"Many hurdles are always there in our practice of ascesis, and even the ascesis have become impracticable, 
oh, Raghava, thus though being eaten away by the demons we are not issuing any curse... 
"Thereby, you along with your brother protect us that are being persecuted by the demons dwelling in 
Dandaka forest as you alone are the protector of ours in these forests...'so said sages to me... 
"On hearing all those words, oh, Seetha, I promised complete protection to the sages of Dandaka forests... 

"Having promised to the sages it is incapable of me to implement it otherwise while I am alive... truth 
is dearer to me, isn't it... 
"I may forfeit my life, forgo Lakshmana, or even forsake you but not a promise, that too especially 
made to Brahmans, and having promised I can never go back... 
"By that reason, oh, Seetha, even if I am unasked, safeguarding sages is definitely to be done by me, 
how then it is undone when given a promise... 
"With your friendship and good-heartedness you say these words, oh, Seetha, I am contended... uninterested 
ones do not forewarn, indeed... 
"Appropriate and seemly is your word of caution to your bloodline, oh, graceful Seetha, you are the 
co-pursuer in dharma with me, hence you are loftier to me than my own lives..." So said Rama to Seetha. 

That exalted soul Rama on saying those words to Seetha, his dear wife and the daughter of Janaka, wielding 
his bow proceeded further with Lakshmana to the picturesque woodlands of hermits. Rama travelled ahead while the glorious Seetha in middle, and wielding bow Lakshmana followed them on 
the rear. 
They proceeded while seeing diverse mountain terraces, forests, and diversely enchanting rivers too, 
along with Seetha. 
Beholding the rivers that have water-birds like saarasa, chakravaaka that move on their sandbanks, and 
also the lakes that contain lotuses and water born birds, they moved on. 
The moved on watching spotted deer banded in herds, the wild boars, large horned buffaloes maddened 
in virility, and the ruttish elephants rending trees like their enemies. 
On going far on their way, and when the sun is dangling in the western skiy, together they saw a charming 
lake of one yojana width fully overloaded with red and white lotuses, overspread with sporting elephants, 
and over-flurried with waterfowls like saarasa birds, kaadamba birds, swans and with others kinds too. 

Out of the tranquil and enchanting waters of that lake audible are the melodies of singing and musical 
instruments, but none is visible. 
Then Rama and also Lakshmana, the great charioteer, inquisitively started to ask the Sage named Dharmabhrita 
about it. 
"On hearing this greatly amazing music from lake, oh, great saint, intensive inquisitiveness is created 
in all of us, why this, please tell us clearly about it." Thus Rama asked. 
Thus said by that Raghava then that virtuous sage quickly started to tell about the efficacy of that 
lake. 
"Oh, Rama, this is an all-time lake built by the ascetic power of the sage Mandakarni, known as Five 
Apsara Lake. 
"He that great saint Mandakarni practiced rigorous ascesis for ten thousand years staying in the waters 
of the lake, and consuming air alone. 
"Then all the gods are worried and met together with Fire-god at the helm of affairs, and they all conversed 
among themselves. 
"This sage is praying for someone's place among us," thus all of those heaven-dwellers are perturbed 
at heart. 
"Then all gods assigned five important Apsara-s, the celestial courtesans, whose shine is like the sprint 
of the lightning, to effectuate hindrance in that sage's ascesis. 
Then those five celestial beauties have led that sage astray who discerned the nature of this and the 
other world, or good and bad, or the nature of Absolute-Soul and Body- bound Soul, towards the passional 
restraint by, as though to achieve god's task.
"Also thus, those five celestial apsara-s attained wifehood of that sage, and for them he built a house 
in there, concealed inside that lake. 
"While those five celestial apsara-s are living in there, they are gratifying that sage according to 
his delight as youthfulness came upon that sage owing to his power of asceticism. 
"These musical sounds we hear are emerging out as played on their instruments, mingled with the tinkling 
of their ornaments, and mixed with their delightful singing of melodies." So said sage Dharmabhrita 
to Rama. 
That highly renowned Raghava together with his brother acknowledged the sage Dharmabhrita's account, 
exclaiming it as "amazing is this..." 
While saying thus Raghava has seen a cluster of hermitages nearby, encircled with sacred grass, jute 
cloths, and even encompassed with Vedic solemness, and he entered that hermitage along with Seetha and 
Lakshmana. 
Rama happily stayed in that august cluster of hermitages duly venerated by those great saints for sometime, 
and then that expert in great missiles Rama went to the hermitages of those sages with whom he stayed 
earlier, for another round. 
Rama stayed there for nearly ten months at some place, elsewhere for one year, at somewhere else for 
four months, and for five, and six months at elsewhere, even at somewhere else for more than a month, 
and for more than one and half months elsewhere. 
While Raghava stayed comfortably taking delight in those hermitages of sages, indeed ten years have 
smoothly elapsed. 
Thus that virtue-knowing glorious Rama on going around those hermitages along with Seetha indeed went 
to the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna again. 
On coming at that hermitage that enemy destroyer is adored by sages, and he resided there for some time. 

Then on one day while staying in that hermitage Rama submissively said this to that sage Suteekshna 
who is sitting nearby. 
"I have always heard through the narratives narrated by other sages that the godly and eminent sage 
Agastya is residing in this forest. 
"But due to the vastness of this forest I have not known that place, where is the pious hermitage of 
that astute sage? 
"I wish to approach that sage seeking that godly sage's graciousness, along with my brother and Seetha 
to venerate him. 
"Can I personally propitiate that supreme sage -- is my high ambition, and it is recurrent in my heart." 
So said Rama to Suteekshna. 
Sage Suteekshna on hearing that particular request of that virtue-minded Rama is gladdened and said 
this to him. 
"Oh, Raghava, even I wished to say this to you, that you may approach Agastya along with Lakshmana and 
Seetha. 
"But providentially you alone raised this topic with me, Rama, I will tell you where that great sage 
Agastya is. 
"On your going four yojana-s from this hermitage, oh, dear Rama, there is the great and glorious hermitage 
of Agastya's brother on the southern side. 
"That hermitage is there on a plateau in a spectacular place of that forest which is adorned with many 
flowers and fruits, thickets of long pepper, and reechoed with the callings of various birds. 
"There are diverse lakes that are receptacles for tranquil waters, that are teeming with swans and partridges, 
beautified with ruddy geese, and Rama staying there for a night you may proceed in the next morning. 

"On going one yojana beyond, taking the southward course on the side of the forest clump you will find 
Agastya's hermitage. 
"Seetha and Lakshmana will enjoy those woodlands adorned with diverse pleasant trees, as the woodlands 
abounding with diverse trees will naturally be delightful, isn't it. 
"If your mind is made up to see that great sage Agastya, oh, great ingenious Rama, resolve your thinking 
in going only today." So said Sage Suteekshna to Rama. 
On listening that which is said by the sage, Rama revered that sage along with his brother, and then 
he journeyed with Seetha and his follower Lakshmana aiming to reach Agastya. 
While viewing beautiful forests, cloud-like mountains, lakes, and rivers that are flowing following 
the pathways, Rama happily journeyed on the pathway indicated by sage Suteekshna, then he gladly spoke 
this sentence to Lakshmana. 
"Definitely this alone appears to be the hermitage of Sage Agastya's brother, one with great soul and 
pious deeds. 
"As how thousands of trees are bowing under the weight of flowers and fruit on the pathway, thereby 
I perceive it to be the hermitage of Agastya's bother. 
"Upraised by the wind the sour-smell of pippali fruits is suddenly coming closer from the forest. 
"Here and there visible are the well heaped heaps of firewood, and all over appearing is the sacred 
grass snipped at its top and gemlike in its tinge. 
"From inside the hermitage in the midst of this forest the vertex of smoke from ritual fire is clearly 
visible as high as the vertex of a black rainy cloud. 
"On performing bathing in sacred streams the Brahmans are making flower offerings to gods, calledpuSpa bali, with the flowers that are personally collected by them. 
"Thus by the words of Sage Suteekshna as I have heard, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this hermitage shall definitely 
be that of Sage Agastya's brother. 
"Whose brother is Sage Agastya with meritorious deeds, who wishing well-being of the world controlled 
death by his efficacy, and who made this southern region a liveable region, this must be the hermitage 
of such a sage, such Agatya's brother. 
"Once upon a time verily cruel demon brothers Vaataapi and Ilvala were here together, and they the dreadful 
demons, they say, used to be Bhraman-killers. 
"Disguising in Bhraman's semblance and speaking sophisticatedly that Ilvala used to invite Brahmans 
for the purpose of obsequial ceremonies, where Brahman are fed after usual ceremony to appeases their 
manes. 
Then Ilvala used to make his brother Vaataapi into a ram, perfect that ram's meat into deliciously cooked 
food, and used to feed Brahmans according to obsequial rites and deeds. 
"When those Brahmans are surfeited with that ram's meat, then Ilvala used to shout loudly, "oh, Vaataapi, 
you may come out." 
"Then on listening his brother's words Vaataapi used to lunge out bleating like a ram, tearing and rending 
the bodies of those Brahmans. 
"This way they the guise changing demons always ruined thousands of Brahmans together, greedy for raw-flesh 
as they are. 
"Then by Sage Agastya, whom gods have prayed to end this demonic menace, and whom demon Ilvala invited 
to feast during obsequial rites, he that Agastya having relished the fiendish demon in the form of ram, 
they say, had finished him off. 
"Then Ilvala while giving lateral hand wash into the palms of Agastya entered in the routine conversation 
of obsequies asking, "Is this rite fulfilled..." and he furthered it in calling his brother to come 
out. 
Then that wise and eminent sage Agastya spoke mockingly to Ilvala who is conversing that way to his 
brother to come out. 
"Where is the energy for that ram shaped demon brother of yours to come out as I digested and sent him 
to the hellish residence of Terminator. 
"Then on hearing the words of sage Agastya affirming brother's demise, that night-walking demon furiously 
commenced to assault the sage. 
"When that demon rushed towards that best Bhraman to kill, he that sage glowing with his own refulgence 
burnt him down just by his flame-like eyes and doomed him to death. 
"This hermitage embellishing with lake and woods belongs to the brother of Sage Agastya who has done 
this impossible deed just by his compassion towards Brahmans." So said Rama to Lakshmana and Seetha 
about Agastya. 
While Rama narrated that way to Lakshmana sun went into dusk and the vesperal time came close of him. 

Worshipping sunset along with brother as per custom, Rama entered that hermitage and greeted that sage. 

Raghava spent one night there when that sage received him well and when they dined on tubers and fruits. 

Raghava spent that night there and when sun rose in solar orbit he took leave of the brother of Sage 
Agastya saying the following. 
"Oh, godly sage, we stayed in the night comfortably, I now make an obeisance and bid farewell to you, 
as I wish to proceed to see your mentor and elder brother Agastya. 
When the brother of Agastya said, "you may go," Rama the legatee of Raghu journeyed on the pathways 
as directed by Suteekshna, and on observing those woodlands. 
On observing the wild grass that grows on its own giving wild grain, Jack-fruit trees, sala trees, Ashoka 
trees, lemons trees, saplings of bilva trees and also madhuka and bilva trees he journeyed. 
Rama has seen hundreds of flowered forest trees that are battered by the trunks of elephants, that are 
adorned with monkeys, reverberated by hundreds of lusty bird folks, and that are enriched by the flowered 
climbers whorled around them. 
Then the lotus-eyed Rama said this to his follower Lakshmana who is a valiant and glory-enriching one 
and who is near at hand. 
"As to how the trees are appearing with velvety leaves, and as to how the animals and birds appear unwearied, 
thus gauging by this it appears that the hermitage of that contemplative soul Agastya is situated not 
very far from here. 
"He who by his own deed is renowned in the world as Agastya, the stopper of mountain, it appears to 
be his hermitage that alleviates the weary of wearied ones. 
"The forest nearby this hermitage is overrun by huge smoke from altars of fire, overstuffed with the 
garlands of jute cloth, overcrowded with the herds of peaceful deer, and also overloaded with sonority 
of the birds. 
"He who impeding death by his yogic might and wishing well-being for worlds made this southern extent 
a liveable province by his pious deeds, his hermitage is this. 
"Under whose influence the demons behold this southern quarter appallingly, and they do not even venture 
to live here, such a sage Agastya's hermitage is this. 
"And from when that pious deeded Agastya took possession of this quarter, from then on the night walkers 
are calmed down and remained without feud. 
"This very worthy southern quarter is known in the name of that godly saint Agastya and this remained 
unattackable to the demons with cruel deeds. 
"Complying which sage's directive Mt. Vindhya ceased to heighten in order not to obstruct the path of 
the sun, such sage's hermitage is this who is renowned in the world by his deeds and whose longevity 
is inestimable, hence this glorious hermitage is adored by well-behaved animals and humans as well. 

"He that gentle sage who is always interested in the respect of sagacious ones is thus an esteemed one 
in the world, and for us when we approach him he accords beneficence. 
"Oh, adept Lakshmana, I wish to worship that great saint Agastya therein that hermitage, and oh, gentle 
one, I think of living the remainder of forest living here only. 
"There gods with gandharva-s, siddha-s, exalted sages will be worshipping Agastya who is self-regulating 
self-disciplinary. 
"There no liar can live, nor a savage, nor even a deceiver, nor a man-torturer, nor one with sinful 
behaviour, for that sage is of that nature. 
"There the gods, celestials, reptiles, birds live together wishing to worship the Absolute with self-discipline. 

"There the blest and great souls of accomplished ascesis rode to heavens by aircrafts similar to sun 
in resplendence, on relinquishing their mortal bodies here and on obtaining new bodies. 
"There gods will endow the state of celestials or immortals, or many realms of divine living to those 
auspicious beings that worship them. 
"We arrived at the threshold of the hermitage, oh, Soumitri, you enter firstly and submit to Sage Agastya 
about my arrival at this place along with Seetha. 
On receiving all those gifts brought in by the Vanara-s from Himalayas, Sugreeva dispersed them all with approbation. 

On dispersing thousands of monkeys who have effectuated their errand of summoning all monkeys on the earth, Sugreeva 
deemed that his own aspirations and as well as those of that great-mighty Rama are achieved. 
Gladdening Sugreeva who is indomitably mighty and the indomitable one among all vanara-s, Lakshmana spoke these 
courteous words to him, "oh, gentle one, if it please you, make an exit from Kishkindha." 
On hearing the courteous words of Lakshmana Sugreeva is extremely pleased and he indeed spoke this sentence to 
him, "So be it. Let us go. I remain biddable in your command." 
Sugreeva speaking thus to Lakshmana, whose person itself is auspicious, then bade adieu to Lady Tara and the other 
female vanara-s. 
Sugreeva shouted sharply saying, "come here," at the best monkey-adjutants and on hearing his call all of those 
monkeys that are spared to see the ladies of palace chambers have come there swiftly with their palms adjoined 
in supplication. 
Then the king Sugreeva whose refulgence is kindred to that of sun has said to those vanara-s that have arrived 
there, "oh, vanara-s, immediately position my palanquin before me." 
On hearing his words those monkeys who are the adept ones in their agility right away brought an exquisite palanquin 
and readily started to position it at his nearby. 
And on seeing palanquin positioned at his nearby the king of monkeys Sugreeva said to Saumitri, "you mount it, 
Lakshmana, be quick." 
Saying so Sugreeva got into that golden carriage which in shine is like the sun and which has many monkey-carriers 
along with Lakshmana. 
Sugreeva who achieved the kingdom of unexcelled magnificence has started out that magnificently to the high extolment 
of panegyrists, while a white royal-parasol spread overhead the palanquin, white fur-fans fanning him from all 
over, and while conch-shells are blowing loud and drums are drumming high. 
Sugreeva travelled thus surrounded with many hundreds of vanara-s, who look confrontational and who wielded weapons, 
to the place where Rama is staying. 
On reaching the province where Rama is staying in all his adoration to that place, the great-resplendent Sugreeva 
descended the palanquin along with Lakshmana. 
When Sugreeva reached Rama he stood still with adjoined-palms, and when he remained still with palm-fold all the 
other monkeys stood still with palm-fold. 
Rama became exultant of Sugreeva on seeing the massive army of Vanara-s which is just like a vast lake plethoric 
with buds of lotuses. 
Raghava raised and tightly hugged the king of monkeys Sugreeva, who has prostrated himself with his head touching 
the feet of Rama, with care and credit. 
After hugging Sugreeva that virtue-souled Rama then said to him, "be seated." Then on seeing Sugreeva who took 
seat on ground Rama spoke to him. 
"He alone is the king, oh, valiant Sugreeva, who always divides time for devoting himself to probity, prosperity 
and pleasure-seeking. 
"If one devotes himself to pleasure-seeking alone, casting off the probity and like that the prosperity also, 
he is like the one who slept on a treetop who awakens only after falling down. 
"And the king who is bound up in eliminating unfriendly ones and bound up with forgathering friends, he will be 
enjoined with righteousness, and he even becomes the real enjoyer of the fruit of threefold virtues, namelydharma, artha, kaama- probity, prosperity and pleasures. 
"Oh, enemy-eliminator, time for endeavour has come, oh, king of monkeys, let this be discussed along with your 
monkey-ministers." Thus Rama spoke to Sugreeva. 
When Rama addressed him in this way, Sugreeva said these words to Rama, "oh, dextrous Rama, by your beneficence 
I have repossessed prosperity, popularity and this everlasting kingdom of monkeys which are actually mislaid. 

"Oh, god, by your and your brother's benevolence alone I regained what I lost, oh, victorious one among victors, 
and he who does not requite the favour that has been done for him will become the vitiator of probity among men. 

"These are the hundreds of vanara chiefs, oh, enemy-subjugator, who have just returned on forgathering all of 
the forceful vanara-s on earth. 
"Oh, Raghava, the legatee of Raghu, those vanara-s with dreadful appearance, and who are the experts in permeating 
the impenetrable forests, woodlands and impassable mountains are coming. And the bears, monkeys and brave baboons 
who are the children of gods and gandharva-s, and who change their guise just by their wish are halfway through 
on their path duly fenced round with one's own forces. 
"Oh, king, some of the fly-jumpers that are arriving are with a hundred-legion, some with a hundred-thousand legion, 
and even some with millions of legions, while the some are on the way with specific legions like aayuta-s, shanku-s. 
And oh, valiant one Rama, some with legions of arbuda-s, and some with hundreds of arbuda-s, some with madhya-s, 
and some with antaH-s are coming. Some more are coming with samudra-s and some with paraardha-s legions of monkeys. 
Oh, enemy-flamer Rama, the legions of monkeys along with their monkey commanders who are viable to Mahendra in 
valour, and who compare with massive clouds and mountains, and who domiciled on Mt. Meru and Mt. Vindhya will 
be coming in your service. 
"Those vanara-s who are combative in wars, and those who can fetch Maithili on eliminating Ravana in war, will 
be approaching you soon." Thus Sugreeva informed Rama. 
Then on seeing the perfect effort made by the prominent one among all monkeys, Sugreeva, who is operating under 
his control, the eyes of valorous prince Rama are widened in jubilance, like the well-bloomed blue-lotuses. The glorious Sugreeva made the following reply, which was intended to expel his
grief, to Rama the son of Dasaratha who felt miserable with anguish.
"Oh, hero! Why are you lamenting thus, as any other ordinary man? Do not be
sorrowful like this. Abandon your grief, as an ungrateful man abandons friendship."
"As the information about Seetha has since been gathered, I do not indeed see any
scope for your grief Oh, Rama!"
"Oh, Rama! You are a wise person, a knower of sacred works, an intellectual and a
learned man. Give up these ordinary apprehensions like a man whose spirit is disciplined gives up
ideas which spoil the purpose.
"We shall make our way up to Lanka, by crossing the ocean filled with large
crocodiles. We shall destroy your enemy."
"All action get dissipated by a person who is non-enthusiastic, depressed and
disturbed with grief. Such a person gets into troubles too."
"These leaders of monkey squads are gallant and efficient in all ways. They are
enthusiastic even to enter a fire for your sake. I understand this from their joy and my reasoning
too is sound."
"You ought to act in every way that I may be able to get back Seetha, after
destroying by an attack the enemy Ravana of sinful deeds."
"You take steps in such a way that a bridge is constructed across the sea and we
reach that city of the king of ogres."
"Be certain that Ravana is killed, once he is seen in a battle and on our seeing
that city of Lanka standing on a peak of the Trikuta Mountain."
"Without building a bridge across the sea, the dreadful abode of Varuna (the god of
water), Lanka cannot be defeated even by gods and demons including Indra."
"Know that when the whole of my army crosses the sea as a bridge is built across it,
they will come out victorious, because these monkeys who are able to change their form at will are
indeed valiant in battle."
"Therefore, take away your apprehensive mind, which destroys any enterprise for
grief in this world diminishes the might of a man, Oh king!"
 Cling to the practice of boldness, ought to be resorted to by a man. It will
produce competence without doubt to the doer quickly."
"Prevail upon the strength with alertness at this moment, Oh highly intelligent
prince! Grief for something lost or destroyed consumes all resources of even the strong and
magnanimous men like you."
"You are the foremost among the intelligent and the knower of all sacred texts.
Hence, you ought to defeat the enemy, with allies like me."
"I do not indeed see any one who can withstand you in a battle filed in the three
worlds, when you are armed with a bow, Oh Rama!"
"You work duly entrusted to the monkeys will not be spoiled. You shall behold Seetha
era imperishable sea."
"Oh, Lord of the earth! Desist from this melancholy. Yield to your legitimate
indignation. Unadventurous Kshatriyas (members of warrior-tribe) never win honor but all fear the
wrathful."
"You with your resourceful mind, along with us together, ponder over now a design to
cross the sea, the terrible Lord of rivers."
"Know victory to be certain, once the sea has been crossed by the army. Verily when
all my forces have passed over the sea our triumph is assured!"
"These monkeys, the courageous soldiers who are able to change their form at their
volition, will crush their opponents with an avalanche of rocks and trees."
"Once we have crossed the sea (the abode of Varuna) by whatever the means employed,
Ravana is as definitely killed in my eyes, Oh exterminator of enemies!"
What is the use of all these words? By all means, you will be a victorious man. I
see good omens and my heard is over thrilled with joy."While that terrific battle, which destroyed many eminent heroes, was in progress,
Angada, who was eager to fight, attacked the valiant Kampana.
Calling Angada to fight, Kampana with fury, rapidly struck him with a mace in
anticipation. Violently hit by him, Angada was reeled.
Restoring consciousness, the energetic Angada hurled a mountain peak. Tormented by
that stroke, Kampana fell down on the ground.
Then, seeing Kampana killed in battle, Shonitaksha fearlessly rushed there towards
Angada quickly in a chariot.
He then swiftly struck Angada with sharp pointed arrows which can tear up the limbs
and with fire-like forms which can destroy the world. He struck with many sharp arrows by the names
of Kshura, Kshurapra, Naaraacha, Vatsatanta, Shilimukha, Karni, Shalya and Vipatha.
The strong and powerful Angada, the son of Vali, with his wounded limbs, crushed his
terrific bow, chariot and darts with his might.
Then, Shonitaksha quickly took a sword and a shield. Enraged as he was, he swiftly
jumped down (from his chariot) unhesitatingly.
Springing forward more swiftly, seizing hold of him with his hand and snatching away
the sword, the strong Angada made a lion's roar.
Angada the foremost of monkeys the sword into the flat surface of his shoulder and
cut him from left to right diagonally.
Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards the
other surviving enemies in the battle-front.
Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards the
other surviving enemies in the battle-front.
That valiant Shonitaksha, wearing golden armlets, restoring his consciousness, took
an iron mace and rushed quickly towards the same Angada.
The strong and the great warrior, Prajangha on his part, along with Yupaksha, was
enraged and rushed towards the mighty Angada with his mace.
Angada, the chief of monkeys, between the two warriors, Shonitaksha and Prajangha,
shone like a full moon between the two asterisms known as Vishakhas.
Protecting Angada, Mainda and Dvivida took their position near Angada, with an
intent to exhibit each of their own martial skill.
The mighty demons with their colossal bodies retaliated and rushed in anger,
wielding swords, arrows and maces, towards the monkeys.
A great battle, causing hair to stand on end, was waged by the three monkey-chiefs
who encountered the three excellent demons.
In the battle-field, the monkeys, seizing hold of trees, hurled them against the
demon-chiefs. The mighty Prajangha, however, cut them down with his sword.
The monkeys in the battle-field hurled trees and rocks towards chariots and horses.
The mighty Yupaksha chopped them off with a flood of arrows.
Shonitaksha, the valiant and the powerful demon, chopped off the trees uplifted and
hurled by Dvivida and Mainda with his mace in the midway itself.
Prajangha, lifting a large sword, which can chop off vital parts of the enemies,
rushed swiftly towards Angada.
Then the mighty Angada, who was exceedingly strong, seeing him coming nearer, struck
him with an Ashvakarna tree.
Angada struck, with his fist, the arm of Prajangha, holding the sword. By that blow,
the sword fell on the ground.
Seeing that sword looking like a pebble (in shape), which fell on the ground, the
mighty Prajangha tightened his thunderbolt like fist.
When that Prajangha of great splendour struck Angaa, the excellent monkey with a
great strength on his forehead, Angada shuddered for a moment.
That Angada of splendour and prowess, restoring his consciousness, struck with his
fist and shattered Prajangha's head off his trunk.
That Yupaksha, with tears filled in his eyes because of the death of his paternal
uncle in battle, quickly took a sword as his arrows were exhausted and descended from his
chariot.
Seeing that Yupaksha rushing on him, Dvivida hurriedly struck Yupaksha on his chest
and with a rage, forcibly caught hold of him.
Seeing his mighty brother being seized, Shonitaksha, of great splendour, then struck
Dvivida on his chest.
That mighty Dvivida, struck by Shonitaksha was tottered; but pulled off the
platter's mace when lifted again on him.
Meanwhile, Mainda came nearer to Dvivida and banged Yupaksha on his chest with his
palm.
Those two demons, Shonitaksha and Yupaksha, who were full of violence, carried on a
keen contest with the two monkeys in the battle field, by pulling and overthrowing them vehemently
and severely.
The valiant Dvivida, after splitting open shonitaksha's face with his claws, threw
him down on the floor by his strength and crushed him down.
Mainda, the foremost of monkeys, was enraged and pressed Yupaksha with his arms.
Yupaksha fell down dead on the ground.
That army of demons, which was perturbed with their great warriors killed, then
moved with its face turned towards the place where Kumbha (the son of Kumbhakarna) was carrying on
battle.
Kumbha, restored to confidence, that army which was coming towards him with speed.
Then, seeing the army of demons whose chief-warriors were thrown down by the most powerful monkeys
who could fulfill their aim, the powerful Kumbha then performed a great feat which was very
difficult to do in a battle.
That Kumbha, the foremost among the wielders of bow, taking his bow and fully
composed, released serpentine arrows which can split open the bodies.
That excellent bow of his, fitted with an arrow, shone like a second bow of Indra
(the rain-god), illumined by flashes of lightning and the splendour of Airavata (the elephant
carrying Indra on its back).
By that arrow with a golden shaft and fastened with feathers, drawn upto his ear and
discharged, he then struck Dvivida.
Suddenly struck by that arrow, that excellent monkey possessing a splendour of Mount
Trikuta, was perturbed, with his feet swaying to and fro and fell down throbbing.
Beholding his brother defeated in that great battle, Mainda there on his part,
taking a large rock, rushed with speed to attack the demon.
While that mighty Mainda hurled that rock towards the demon, Kumbha broke that rock
into pieces with his five shining arrows.
Stretching another arrow resembling a serpent and with a good pointed tip, Kumbha of
a great splendour, struck it on the chest of Mainda the brother of Dvivida.
As that blow of Kumbha's arrow struck that Mainda, the monkey-chief, on his vital
parts, he fell unconscious on the ground.
Seeing both his mighty maternal uncles wounded, Angada rushed speedily towards
Kumbha, who was standing with his bow uplifted.
With five steel arrows and with three other sharp-edged arrows, Kumbha pierced that
Angada advancing towards him, as on would pierce an elephant with goads.
That valiant Kumbha pierced Angada with a multiple of sharp arrows, decked in gold,
with edges which were harsh and sharp.
Angada, the son of wind-god, though pierced all over the body with sharp arrows, was
however not shaken. He showered a rain of rocks and trees on Kumbha's head.
The glorious Kumbha the son of Kumbhakarna chopped off all those trees hurled by
Angada and burst off the rocks further.
Seeing Angada the monkey-chief rushing upon him, Kumbha pierced his brows with his
brows with his arrows, as an elephant would be struck with flaming torches.
Since Angada's blood was oozing out, his eyes were covered with blood; Covering his
eyes, dampened with blood, with one hand, he caught hold of a Sala tree nearby with another
hand.
In the battle-field, propping that tree with branches and all, on his chest, holding
it with his hand and bending a little, Angada uprooted it from the ground.
While all the demons were looking on, Angada hurled that tree-which was tall like
Indra's banner and resembled Mount Mandara in size.
That Kumbha chopped off that tree with seven sharp arrows which were capable of
splitting asunder the body. That Angada was very much perturbed and fell down, swooning.
Seeing the unconquerable Angada fallen down and sinking into depression as though in
an ocean, the monkey-chiefs informed the matter to Rama.
Hearing of Angada being seized with anguish in that great combat, Rama sent out for
help, leaders of monkeys, headed by Jambavan.
Hearing Rama's message, those excellent monkeys were very much enraged and quickly
rushed towards Kumbha who was wielding a bow in his hand.
With an intent to defend Angada, the monkey-chiefs then holding trees and rocks in
their hands and with their furious blood-red eyes, rushed on.
The enraged Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi, the monkey ran up towards Kumbha the
son of Kumbhakarna to attack him.
Seeing those mighty monkey-chiefs coming nearer to him, Kumbha covered them with a
flood of arrows, as one would obstruct the course of a stream by means of a rock.
Reaching the range of his arrows, the great souled monkey-chiefs were unable even to
look at him, much less advance towards him, any more than a great ocean would overstep its
shore.
Seeing those troops of monkeys being tormented by a flood of arrows, Sugreeva the
king of monkeys, keeping Angada his brother's son in the rear, rushed headlong towards Kumbha in
the battle, as a swift lion would bounce upon an elephant walking along the slopes of a
mountain.
Uprooting many large trees beginning with Ashvakarna and many kinds of trees,
Sugreeva the king of monkeys hurled them on Kumbha.
The illustrious Kumbha, the son of Kumbhakarna, with his sharp arrows, chopped off
that down pour of trees, which was obscuring the sky and which was difficult to be assailed.
The trees, chopped off with his sharp arrows by the brutal Kumbha, skilled in
hitting his target, shone like terrific Shataghnis (stones or cylindrical pieces of wood studded
with iron spikes).
Seeing that shower of trees chopped off by Kumbha, the mighty and illustrious
Sugreeva of valour was not disturbed.
Enduring those arrows being hit, Sugreeva snatched away Kumbha's bow, possessing the
splendour of a rain-bow and broke it all at once.
Thus bouncing swiftly and doing that most difficult task, the enraged Sugreeva spoke
(as follows) to Kumbha, who was looking like an elephant with a broken tusk.
"O Kumbha, the elder brother of Nikumbha! Both your prowess and the swiftness of
your arrow are wonderful. Both Ravana and you are equal in complaisance towards demons and the
majesty too exists.
"O Kumbha, the compeer of Prahlada, Bali, Indra (the destroyer of the demon Vritra),
Kubera (the god of riches) and Varuna (the god of water)! You alone are born with a likeness of
your father (Kumbhakarna) who was exceedingly strong."
"The celestials cannot surpass even you alone, with a spike in hand, who can destroy
the enemy with your large arms, as mental agonies cannot overwhelm the one who subdued his senses.
Hence, exhibit your prowess, O demon of great intellect and see my exploits."
"Because of the boon received by him, Ravana your uncle is able to attack the
celestials and demons. But Kumbhakarna (your father) on his part is tolerating the celestials and
demons."
"You are equal in archery to Indrajit and in prowess to Ravana. Hence, you are now
the foremost in strength and heroism among the demon-folk."
"Let the created beings see your great wonderful fight with me in the battle field
today, as they saw that fight between Indra and Shambara, the demon."
"You have performed an incomparable task. You have also shown your skill in missile
weaponry. You have struck down these monkey-heroes possessing a terrific prowess."
"O valiant demon! Since you look tired after performing your martial duty, I did not
kill you, with a fear of public censure. Identify my strength, after taking some rest."
Kumbha was thus honoured with those insulting words of Sugreeva. Kumbha's splendour
then enhanced, like the splendour of the sacrificial fire, when a melted butter is offered to it as
an oblation."
The reopen, Kumbha pressingly clasped Sugreeva in his arms. Then, they stood
breathing heavily again and again as elephants in rut, having their bodies fastened against each
other, rubbing one another and emitting a flame to blaze with smoke from their faces because of
their fatigue.
The battle-ground sank under the trampling of their feet. With their waves whirled
about, the ocean became turbulent.
Then tossing up Kumbha, Sugreeva threw him down speedily into the ocean, showing him
the bottom of the sea.
Due to the hurling down of Kumbha, the fully risen sea, reaching a height of as to
that of Mount Vindhya, diffused on all sides.
The enraged Kumbha, then jumping up and throwing down Sugreeva, struck him on his
chest with his thunderbolt-like fist.
Sugreeva's armour was burst asunder. Even blood appeared oozing out of his chest.
His cage of bones gave a counter-strike to that awfully forceful fist.
Then, by the force of that fist shot forth there, a mighty flame resembling the fire
that bursts up on Mount Meru, was born out of a stroke of lightning.
Thus struck by Kumbha there, that mighty Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, tightened
his fist which appeared like a thunderbolt.
The valiant Sugreeva forcefully descended his fist, which shone like the solar disc
encircled by a thousand rays, on the breast of Kumbha.
That Kumbha, very much hurt by that blow, was exhausted and then fell down, like
fire whose flame has extinguished.
Thus struck with Sugreeva's fist, that demon fell down suddenly, as the planet Mars,
of splendid rays, would drop down from the sky accidentally.
When Kumbha was killed in battle by Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, possessing a
terrific prowess, the earth with its mountains and forests trembled. Too much fear seized the
demons.Being killed by each other in that major battle, those two armies were very much
diminished soon, like two lakes in a severe summer.
Ravana the lord of demons got doubly enraged because of the destroyal of his own
army and the fall of Virupaksha.
He felt restless to find his own army diminished while being killed by the monkeys
and to see the reversal of his fate.
He spoke to Mahodara, the annihilator of enemies, standing beside him (as follows):
"O the long-armed! At this juncture, my hope for victory is centered in you."
"O the brave demon! Destroy the army of our enemies. Show your prowess now. This is
the time to repay the debt of your master (received in the form of sustenance from him). Fight
well."
Hearing the words of Ravana, Mahodara the chief of demons saying "So it be",
penetrated into the army of enemies, as a moth rushed into a flame.
Emboldened by the words of his master, that mighty demon, with full of energy,
destroyed the monkeys by dint of his own valour.
Taking hold of huge rocks and penetrating the terrific army of enemies, those highly
strong monkeys too started killing all the demons.
In that great battle, the highly enraged Mahodara, with his arrows decked in gold,
chopped off the hands, feet and thighs of monkeys.
Then, among all those monkeys who were tormented by the demons, some ran away into
ten directions. Some others sought refuge with Sugreeva.
Seeing the large army of monkeys defeated in the battle, Sugreeva rushed towards
Mahodara who was immediately close to him.
Seizing hold of a large and terrific rock, which looked like a mountain, Sugreeva
who was endowed with a great energy, hurled it with an aim to kill the demon.
Seeing that rock falling suddenly, Mahodara, then unagitated, tore it with his
arrows, though it was difficult to approach.
That rock, broken to a thousand pieces by that demon with a multitude of his arrows,
forthwith fell down on earth, like a flock of frightened vultures.
Filled with rage on seeing that rock broken and uprooting a Sala tree, Sugreeva
hurled it at his enemy and Mahodara chopped it off into many pieces.
The valiant Mahodara, who was the tormentator of hostile forces, lacerated Sugreeva
with his arrows. That enraged Sugreeva then saw an iron rod on the ground.
Swinging that flashing iron rod and showing it to him, Sugreeva killed the excellent
horses of Mahodara with that iron rod of terrible speed.
Jumping down from that huge chariot, whose horses had been killed, that valiant
Mahodara the demon, thereupon seized hold of a mace with anger.
With a mace and an iron road respectively in their hands and roaring like two bulls
and resembling like two clouds charged with lightning, those two heroes closed in for a battle.
Mahodara the demon was angry with Sgureeva and thereupon hurled his blazing mace,
which shone like the sun, on Sugreeva.
Seeing that highly terrible mace, falling on him in that great battle, the mighty
Sugreeva, the King of monkeys, was enraged with red eyes and struck that mace, by lifting up the
iron rod. That iron rod broke off and fell on the ground.
Thereupon, the spirited Sugreeva took hold of a formidable steel club, entirely
decked with gold, from the earth-surface.
Lifting that steel club, Sugreeva hurled it. Mahodara too hurled another mace on
him. Those two weapons, clashing each other, broke and fell on the floor.
As all their weapons were broken, those two warriors, who were endowed with spirit
and strength, resembling two blazing fires, started contending with fists.
Roaring again and again, those two warriors then banged each other. Slapping each
other with their palms, they rolled on the earth's surface.
They raised quickly on their feet and then began to strike each other. Remaining
unyielded, the two heroes pushed each other on their shoulders.
Those two heroes, the annihilators their enemies, felt exhausted in the course of
their wrestling. Then the highly fast Mahodara the demon took hold of a sword and a shield, lying
not very far.
In the same way, the highly swift Sugreeva the foremost of monkeys took hold of a
large sword together with a shield, lying there.
Thereupon, those two warriors, who were skilled in the use of weaponry in the
battle-field and whose limbs were seized with anger, galloped forward, roaring with joy, with their
swords upraised.
With their thoughts concentrated on one point of victory, both the warriors were
enraged with each other and performed circumambulations form left to right, very quickly.
That valiant and evil-minded Mahodara, who was boasting of his own prowess, let fall
with very high speed, that sword on the heavy shield of Sugreeva.
Even while Mahodara was extracting his sword which had got struck in the shield,
Sugreeva severed with his own sword, Mahodara's head, which was adorned with ear-rings and
helmet.
While Mahodara, with his head chopped off, was falling on the ground, Ravana's army,
on seeing it, could no longer be seen on the battle-field.
Having killed Mahodara, Sugreeva made a rejoicing roar with his monkeys. Ravana was
enraged. Rama looked rejoicing.
With their faces looking low-spirited all the demons felt dejected. With their minds
stricken with fear, all of them ran away from the battle-field.
Having thrown down to the ground that Mahodara, looking like a part of a huge
mountain lying shattered the invincible Sugreeva shone in glory in the battle-field like the sun
shines with its rays.
Having attained victory in the battle-front, Sugreeva then continued to be looked at
by the multitude of gods, Siddhas (a class of demigods who are endowed with mystic powers) and
Yakshas (another class of demigods attending on Kubera, the god of riches) as also a host of beings
standing on the earth's surface who were all overwhelmed with joy.The battle-field there, on its part, was strewn on that occasion with those monkeys
whose bodies had thus been torn asunder by Ravana with his arrows.
Those monkeys could not bear that irresistible descent of arrows loosed by Ravana,
any more than moths would bear a blazing fire.
Those monkeys tormented by sharp arrows, fled away roaring, as elephants run away,
when enveloped in flames of fire and getting scorched by them.
Ravana was marching forward swiftly in that battle-field, blowing away the army of
monkeys, like the wind blows away large clouds.
Having brought about with his might the destruction of those monkeys in battle,
Ravana quickly approached Rama on the battle-field.
Seeing those monkeys running away in defeat in that battle, Sugreeva kept Sushena in
charge of his army and quickly threw his mind into the fight.
Keeping that Sushena who was equal to himself, his substitute, that Sugreeva, armed
with the tree as a weapon, marched forward towards the enemy.
Taking huge rocks and various kinds of trees, all the monkey-warriors followed
Sugreeva at his side and behind.
The gigantic Sugreeva roared at a high pitch in the battle-field. Striking with his
blows, he crushed various other chiefs of demons.
The colossal bodied Sugreeva smashed the demons, as the grown-up trees are smashed
by the wind at the time of dissolution of the world.
Sugreeva rained a hail of rocks on the army of demons, as a cloud rains a shower of
hail-stones on a host of birds in a forest.
While those demons, thus defeated by Sugreeva, falling on the floor and then
roaring, get diminished in number from all sides, the indomitable Virupaksha the demon, holding a
bow, pronouncing his name by himself, descended from his chariot and mounted the back of an
elephant.
That mighty Virupaksha, mounting that elephant, then roared a terrific noise and
rushed towards the monkeys.
Virupaksha released dreadful arrows on Sugreeva who was at the front-rank of the
army. He strengthened his support to the worried demons, by cheering them up.
Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, when he was struck severely with sharp arrows by that
demon, shouted loudly. With profuse anger, he set his mind on killing him.
Uplifting a tree and coming near that huge elephant, the valiant Sugreeva, a
thorough fighter, struck it on its face.
That huge elephant, struck with the blow of Sugreeva, receded to a distance of four
yards, sank down and roared too.
Descending quickly from his wounded elephant, that valiant demon then seizing hold
of his sword from a shield made of a bull's hide and advancing in rapid paces, facing towards
Sugreeva his enemy, approached him, who stood firm, threatening him as it were.
Taking a huge rock, which looked like a cloud, that Sugreeva, who felt enraged,
threw it on Virupaksha.
Seeing that rock falling, that highly valiant and excellent of demons then receding
away, struck him with a sword.
Wounded by the blow of the sword of that strong demon, Sugreeva became as though
unconscious on the ground, for a moment.
Then, bouncing up suddenly in that great battle, Sugreeva, tightening his fist,
brought it down on the demon's chest violently.
Feeling enraged, when struck by the blow of that fist, Virupaksha the demon brought
down the armour of Sugreeva by his sword at the battle-front. Thus struck by him, Sugreeva fell
down from his feet.
Getting up when fallen, Sugreeva gave him a slap, which produced a terrific sound
similar to a thunder.
Setting himself free from that slap, which was about to be raised by Sugreeva
skillfully, Virupaksha the demon struck Sugreeva on the chest with his fist.
Then, seeing that demon escaping his blow, Sugreeva the monkey-king for his part,
very much enraged.
That monkey saw an opportunity to strike that Virupaksha. Then, with anger, Sugreeva
brought down another violent slap on his temple-bone.
Virupaksha, struck by the blow of that palm, which was like the thunderbolt to the
ground, oozing blood profusely from the (nine) apertures* of his body, as water flows from the
spring.
The monkeys saw Virupaksha, bathed in foaming blood, with his eyes rolling through
anger and as such rendered all the more deformed.*
The monkeys saw their enemy, bathed in blood, turning to and from as also throbbing
on his sides and roaring piteously.
Confronting together in the battle-field in that way, those two violent and terrific
armies which were extensive as oceans, of monkeys and demons, roared like two large oceans which
had burst their bounds.
Beholding that mighty Virupaksha killed by Sugreeva, the army of monkeys and demons
together looked like the agitated river of Ganga.s
The lord of fly-jumpers, King Sugreeva, who by now is replete with every means, then spoke to the tiger-man 
and the vanquisher of the enemy's might, Rama. 
"The mighty vanara chiefs who are guise-changers by their wish and who in sheen are like Mahendra, and who dwell 
in my province have arrived and they are properly encamped too. 
"Those ghastly vanara-chiefs who are a match to the monsters and ogres have arrived with these diversely triumphant, 
victorious and mighty vanara-soldiers. 
"Oh, Rama, these vanara-s are acclaimed for undertaking impossible deeds, and they will accomplish whatever task 
they have undertaken. They are powerful ones who have overcome weariness. They are renowned for their confrontation 
and noteworthy in their manoeuvres. These who are the dwellers on diverse mountains can travel either on earth 
or on water. Such as they are these vanara-s have come in millionfold as your servants. 
"All of them will conduct themselves in orderliness and all abide by the welfare of their king, and oh, Rama, 
the enemy-repressor, they will be able to discharge whatever task entrusted to them at your discretion. 
"Such of those ghastly vanara-chiefs who are a match to the monsters and ogres have arrived with these diversely 
triumphant, terribly victorious and mighty vanara-soldiers. 
"Oh, the manly tiger Rama, whichever you think fit and seasonable that may be said. It will be apt of you to give 
orders to this vanara force since this has joined up under your command. 
"This task of yours is known to me in its nature. Even then, it will be apt of you to give them orders 
as befitting." Thus Sugreeva spoke to Rama. 
While Sugreeva is speaking thus, Rama the son of Dasharatha heartily hugs him with both of his arms and said 
this word to him. 
"Oh, gracious Sugreeva, whether Vaidehi is alive or not - it shall be known. Likewise, oh, well-informed one that 
place in which Ravana dwells - it is to be determined, at the outset. 
"Only on knowing about Vaidehi, also about the dwelling place of Ravana, I will order the timely action at 
that time, that too, after deliberating with you. 
"Oh, chief of vanara-s, I am not the master of this task, nor Lakshmana is, but you, oh king of fly-jumpers, are 
the catalyst and master of this task of searching for Seetha. 
"Oh, lord of vanara-s, you alone have to give orders for the right determination of my task, and what my task 
is, oh, valiant one, you are fully aware of it, isn't it? And it is inoffensive of you to issue orders in this 
regard. 
"You are a kind-hearted one. To me, you are the second-best one, the first being Lakshmana. More so, you are a valorous 
vanara, an intellectual, a knower of the scope of the time and you joined forces with us in our welfare, a partner 
and a patron of ours, and the best one among all those who are aware of our intentions." Thus Rama said to Sugreeva. 

When Rama said so, Sugreeva spoke in the presence of Rama and the observant Lakshmana, to the mightiest chief of 
fly-jumpers, named Vinata, who is a commander of the vanara army, who is like a mountain in his sheen and who thunders 
like a cloud. 
"Oh, Vinata, the best vanara, you are an expert in determining the tasks in consonance with time, place and probity. 
Hence, you along with vanara-s, whose glow shall be like the moon and sun for they shall be from the progeny of 
Sun and Moon, and even accompanied with a hundred thousand, say one lakh, other powerful vanara-s, shall go over 
Eastern direction of the earth inclusive of its mountains, woodlands and forests. 
"There is the East, the forests, mountains and impassable places shall be searched for the princess from Videha 
kingdom, namely Seetha, and even for the residency of Ravana. 
"Search shall be conducted at the riversides of heartening rivers like River Bhaagiirathi, another name for River 
Ganga, and River Sarayu, like that at River Kaushiki, and the pleasing surrounds of River Yamuna, and on Mt. 
Kalinda, as well as River Saraswati, River Sindhu and the river whose waters are lustrous like gems, namely 
River Shona, and further at River Mahi and River Kaalamahi which rivers are brightened by mountains and forests 
surrounding them. And the kingdoms like Brahmamaala, Videha, Maalva, Kaashi, and Kosala, and in Maagadha, which 
kingdom has grand villages, and in that way, also in the kingdoms of Pundra and Anga, and in the countries of 
the kings called Koshakaara, and in the provinces of silver mines search is to be conducted. [--b, , , 
]
"While you explore those places in their entirety, thereabout you have to search for Rama's dear wife and king 
Dasharatha's daughter-in-law Seetha. 
"Oh, forest-dwelling vanara-s, you shall search on the mountains and in the townships that are steeped in the 
ocean. You have to search on the peak of Mt. Mandara, where some extensive and unsightly beings are harboured, 
and at places where some other beings live with odd physical features. Some of them have no ears, while some have 
their lips as their ears. Some are with grisly faces like iron-faced-beings while some beings, although they are 
single-footed, yet they are very rapid. While some tribals are unkillable and mighty man-eaters, some others have 
golden complexion, and they will be pleasant in their appearance with towering wisps. Some other tribals who live 
on islands budge underwater as they are raw fish eaters and they are observed as horrific man-tigers i.e., 
half-man and half-tiger, like mermaids. All of their dwellings are to be searched injambuu 
dwiipa, the tableland that contains Bharata varSa, namely India. And you have 
to go beyond this to other easterly places that are reachable either by mountaineering, by hopping, or even 
by boating. 
"You strive hard on the island of Yava, which will be splendorous with seven kingdoms, like that even in Golden 
and Silver islands that are enwreathed with gold mines, in and around Yava islands. On crossing over Yava Island, 
there is a mountain named Shishira, which touches heaven with its peak, and which gods and demons adore. You shall 
collectively rake through all the impassable mountains, waterfalls, and forests in these islands for the glorious 
wife of Rama. 
"Then, having gone to the other coast of the ocean you reach River Shona, waters of which will be reddish with 
deep and speedy drift, and which is adored by siddha-s and carana-s. You have to scout thereabout for Vaidehi 
as well as for Ravana, at those beautiful ghats, say littorals of that Shona River, and in the amazing forests 
alongshore. Then proceed to an island called Plaksha Island. 
"On that Plaksha Island, very vast rivers emerge from mountains, but alongshore they have many pleasure gardens. 
You have to search in those gardens and at rivers together with the cavernous mountains and forests of that island, 
and then proceed to Ikshu Island. 
"It will be apt of you to proceed from there and see the furious, tempestuous, blaring, and tide-ripped 
ocean called Samudra, Salt Ocean, and that ocean's islands which will be extremely 
ghastly. 
"That ocean which mirrors a dark cloud and hallowed by great serpents, and which blares blatantly is to be traversed 
only by its shores or tactfully, to avoid shadow-capturing of its inhabitants. There you will see colossal-bodied 
demons with everlasting hunger inhibiting that ocean, which demons always capture prey by the shadow of prey as 
endued by Brahma. 
"From there, on going to the disastrous ocean named Lohita, Red Ocean, for its waters are red, you shall see the 
colossal tree Kuuta-shalmali. This island is called Dwiipa, Shaalmali Island 
because of this tree. 
"On that Shalmali Island in Wine Ocean, you will be seeing the mansion of Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle 
of Vishnu, which is decorated with numerous jewels, and which in sheen will be like Mt. Kailash, the abode of 
Shiva. This mansion is a construction of Vishvakarma, the Heavenly Architect. 
"Thereabout horrifying and merciless demons of various shapes and similar to mountains in size, called Mandela-s, 
will be dangling upside down from mountain peaks. 
"Day after day those demons will be falling in the water when the sun always burns them at sunrise and when the impetus 
of Gayatri's hymn fells them down, yet they will be resurfacing and dangling on the mountaintops day after day. 

"Oh, unassailable vanara-s, on your going therefrom you shall see the milk ocean, which will be like a whitish 
cloud in its shine, and even like a pearly necklace while her ripples will be swaying. 
"In the centre of that milk ocean, there is a white mountain of colossal size, named Rishabha, surrounded with 
closely growing trees ever flowered with flowers of heavenly fragrance. And a lake renowned as Lake Sudarshana 
is also there, which is replete with silvery lotuses whose fibrils are golden in sparkle, and in which kingly 
swans will be scampering about. 
"To enjoy frolicking in that Sudarshana Lake the gods, carina-s, yaksha-s, kinnara-s and hosts of apsara females 
will be arriving at that lotus lake gladsomely. 
"And on crossing over the milky ocean, oh vanara-s, then you will be immediately seeing the soft-water ocean which 
will be frightening to all beings. 
"There exists a fantastically refulgent Fire in the form of Horse's Face that originated from the anger of Sage 
Aurasa. The victuals of that Fire are said to be the highly speedy waves of the ocean, together with all of the 
mobile and sessile beings of the world at the close of each Era. 
"There the high squealing sounds of oceanic beings dwelling undersea are audible, and although they are capable 
ones, they are incapacitated on feeling Fire from the Horse Mouth as such they yell. 
"On the northern province of that soft-water ocean, there is a hugely enormous mountain named Jaataruupa-shila, 
Golden Rock Mountain, which glitters like gold and which spreads across thirteen yojana-s. 
"There you shall see then, oh, vanara-s, the lotus-petal broad-eyed thousand-hooded serpent god in black clothing, 
namely, Ananta, sitting on the top of that mountain and sustaining the earth on his head, who will be like the moon 
in his brilliance and whom all beings hold in reverence. 
"A golden pylon resembling a palm tree with three branches as its heads is established on the peak of that mountain 
as the insignia of that great-souled Ananta, and it will be lustrous with a golden podium. 
"That pylon of palm tree is constructed as the easterly compass by celestials gods, and beyond that, a completely 
golden mountain is there, namely the august Udaya Mountain, the Mt. Sunrise, beyond which it is all west. The 
pinnacles of Mt. Sunrise will be touching the heavens for their height is a hundred yojana-s and that divine mountain 
greatly glitters for it is completely golden, and it is pedestalled with such like glittering mountains. [--, 
]
"That Mt. Sunrise will be splendorous with well-flowered and beautiful saala, palm, Tamaala, and Karnikaara trees 
which are completely golden in hue and which will be glittering similar to the sun. 
"On the apex of that Mt. Sunrise there is another pinnacle with one yojana width and ten yojana-s height named 
Saumanasa, which is completely golden and very firm. 
"Earlier while treading the three worlds in the incarnation of Trivikrama, the Supreme Person Vishnu made His 
first foothold on that pinnacle Saumanasa, and the second on the pinnacle of Mt. Meru to tread the heavens. 
"The Sun is by far discernable in Jambu Dwiipa when he rises on this zenithal pinnacle Saumanasa after he had 
circled the Jambu Dwiipa in a northerly route. 
"There the great sages with nomenclature of Vaikhanasa-s and Vaalakhilyaa-s will come into view with an ambience 
of luminosity, for those ascetics will be with the resplendence of the Sun. 
"In the presence of which resplendence the eyes of all living beings will become enlightened, and whereat that 
illuminating entity of the universe, namely the Sun, will be sojourning, this is why Sudarshana Island, named so 
because it contains Sudarshana Lake. 
"On the top of Mt. Sunrise, and even in its cave and forests of that island Ravana is to be searched, together 
with Seetha. 
"The eastern aurora glows redly because the golden hue of Mt. Sunrise imbricates the resplendence of the beneficent 
Sun. 
"In the beginning Brahma, the Creator, ordained this Mt. Sunrise to be the gateway for the earth to heaven, and 
even as the rising place for the Sun, as such this is verily said as the 'eastern quarter' of the compass. 
"Ransack that mountain's peak, even thereabout the rapids and caverns of that mountain for Vaidehi, and even for 
Ravana. 
"Beyond Mt. Sunrise the eastern quarter is impassable. It will be hemmed in with gods since it is the gateway to 
heaven, and everything is imperceivable hedged in oblivion, since it will be void of both Sun and Moon. 
"Janaki shall be scouted out on all those mountains, caverns and forests that are indicated by me, and even at 
places that are not indicated by me. 
"The vanara-s can go only up to there, oh, best vanara-s, and we do not know those 
sunless and boundless realms available far and beyond. 
"You shall come back within a month to find out Vaidehi and the residency of Ravana after you reach Mt. 
Sunrise. 
"And none shall stay behind for more than a month, and if anyone stays I have to exercise coup de grace. So, you 
shall return with your purpose accomplished in exploring for Maithili. 
"On searching the eastern quarter expertly, which quarter is cherished by no less than Mahendra and which is circuited 
by the grooves of forests, and on attaining Seetha, the dear wife of the one born in Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, 
and on returning from that Far East, you all may live long happily." Thus Sugreeva addressed the vanara-s that 
are being sent to East under the leadership of Vinata. 
On sending his father-in-law, namely Susheshana, to westerly direction then the king
of Vanara-s Sugreeva, spoke to a valorous vanara named Shatabali. 
That knowledgeable and powerful one among all monkeys, King Sugreeva, spoke
words to Shatabala that were advantageous to himself, and beneficial to Rama as well. 
"Accompanied by a hundred thousand forest-dwelling monkeys of your kind, and also
with all of your ministers who are the sons of Yama, the Terminator, you have to proceed. 
"Oh, venturesome Shatabala, you scout out the whole of the northern quarter that has
snowy Himalayan mountains as its crown for the glorious wife of Rama. 
"Oh, enterprising vanara-s, when this mission is complete and when we can effectuate
a task agreeable to Rama, we will become debt-free and accomplish our purpose. 
"Great-souled Raghava has indeed done a favor to us, isn't it? If there is
reciprocation to that kind deed, our lives will become fruitful. 
"He who completes the deed of a requester, even though that requester has not
rendered any help earlier, his life becomes fruitful. Then what is there to say again about him who
has already received help from the requester? 
"Let all of you abide by such thinking as you are the well-wishers of our
well-being and welfare, and undertake your mission in such a way as to how Seetha can be found in
your search. 
"On his part this Rama, who is the best one among men and the champion of enemies'
fastnesses, is the estimable one for all beings, and his interests have indeed fallen in with ours.

"Let all of you with your assets of wisdom and valor rake over all of these
impassable places, rivers, mountains, and also their canyons. 
"There in the north, the provinces of Mleccha-s, Pulinda-s, that way Shurashena -
Prasthala - Bharata - Kuru - Madraka - Kaambhoja - Yavana shall be scrutinized along with the
cities of Shaka and Darada, and then search in the Himalayas. 
"In the stands of Lodhra trees, Padmaka trees, and the woods of Devadaru, or
Deodar trees, Ravana is to be searched here and there, together with Seetha. 
"You to Soma hermitage, which is adored by the gods and Gandharva-s, and then you go
to that great-peaked mountain named Mt. Kala. 
"On its cliffs, mountainsides, and caves the highly fortunate and impeccable wife
of Rama shall be searched. 
"Ongoing across that lordly mountain Kala, which great-mountain is impregnated with
gold, it will be apt of you to go to the mountain named Sudarshana afterward. 
"Later there will be a mountain overspread with various birds and adorned with
varied trees named Devasakha which is a sanctuary for birds. 
"Let Ravana be quested after in the segments of woods, at waterfalls, and even in
caverns of that mountain, together with Vaidehi. 
"On crossing Mt. Devasakha, there is a vacant land to a span of hundred yojana-s all
around, which is devoid of mountains, rivers, and even trees, and discarded by all beings.

"But you all will be overjoyed on traversing that hair-raising wasteland quickly and
on attaining Mt. Kailash. 
"There is the delightful mansion of Kubera, which in shine will be like a silver
cloud and processed with gold, and the Divine Architect Vishvakarma has constructed it.

"Where an expansive lake is there, which is replete with lotuses and costumes,
overrun by swans and partridges, and adored by throngs of apsara-s, that is the place of Kubera,
Deity for Wealth-Management. 
"The son of Sage Vaishravana and king of yaksha-s, who is reverenced by all beings
for he is the money giver, that fortunate king will be rejoicing there along with guhyaka-s, viz.,
yaksha-s. 
"Ravana shall be searched on Mt. Kailash, and even in the caves of nearby mountains
which will be shining like moon, together with Vaidehi. 
"Thereafter on reaching Mt. Kraunca, you shall cautiously enter into a highly
impassable tunnel of that mountain to search Seetha. That tunnel, they say, is an un-enterable one.

"In that tunnel great-souled sages reside at the request of gods, and those
great-sages are similar to Sun in their resplendence and godly in their mien. Even then, you search
for Ravana therein that tunnel. 
"Besides the main peak of Mt. Kraunca, its other peaks, terraces, crevices and
midriffs shall be searched, far and wide. 
"The treeless Mt. Kaama and the abode of birds Mt. Maanasa are also to be searched,
and there is no inlet for any being, let alone gods or demons. 
"You all have to search Mt. Kraunca inclusive of its mountainsides, grades, and its
fringe mountains, and on moving away from Mt. Kraunca, a mountain named Mainaaka is there.

"The mansion of the demon Maya is there which is built by himself and Mt.
Mainaaka is to be searched out, inclusive of its crests, grades, and caves. Thereabout the dwellings
of horse-faced females, namely KimpuruSa-s, are there and you have to search them also. [--,
a]
"On crossing over that province, there is the hermitage adored by siddha-s, the
resolved-souls. There the sages, namely Siddha-s, vaikhaanasa-s, and vaalakhilyaa-s will be.

"Then you venerate those sages with accomplished souls, whose asceticism alone has
effaced their blemishes, and you may even humbly ask them after Seetha's whereabouts. [--b,
a]
"There is the lake belonging to Vaikhaanasa sages, overspread with golden lotuses,
and overrun with prosperous swans whose resplendence will be similar to the tender sun. [--b,
a]
"The carrier elephant of Kubera known as Saarvabhauma will always be visiting that
place along with she-elephants. 
"Passing that lake there will be just sky which will be devoid of moon, or sun, or
the clusters of stars, and it will be cloudless and noiseless. 
"That place will be luminescent with the self-resplendence of godlike sages who have
accomplished their asceticism and are taking rest at that place, as if illuminated with
innumerable rays of the sun. 
"On crossing over that province, there is a deep-flowing river named Shailoda. On
both of its riverbanks bamboo brakes called Keecaka-s will be there. Those bamboos will enable the movement of siddha-s, accomplished souls, from one bank to the other. [--,
a]
"Then there is the North Kuru, the dwelling of those who have achieved divine merit
in their previous births and are now born in that country to enjoy the fruits of that divine merit,
thus that country itself is earmarked for meritorious beings. At that place, the lotuses in the
rivers will be golden in hue. The runners and stalks of lotus plants bear lotus leaves that are
bluish like the bluishness of lapis lazuli. There will be thousands of such rivers filled with such
plants in water, and with waters mingled with the waters of other lakes, and decorated with the
thickets of red Costumes alongshore. 
"Everywhere that province shines forth with highly valuable leaves which will be in
the hue of sapphires, with fibrils in the hue of gold, and with amazing thickets of blue costumes
around lakes, which lakes will be surrounding that province with a resplendence similar to the sun.

"There the dunes of deep flowing rivers are lumped together with incomparable
pearls, highly valuable jewels, and gold. 
"That province has amazing mountains that are replete with every kind of jewel,
golden in hue, splendorous like Ritual-fire, and they are intercalated into the deep flowing
rivers. 
"There the trees will be eternally flowering and fruiting on which birds will be
endlessly squawking. Their yield will be spilling forth meeting every delicacy with a divine smell,
taste, and touch. Some other best trees will yield clothing in numerous shapes. 
"Some of the best trees will be yielding such of those adornments which will be
vying with ornament made with pearls or with lapis gemstones, and suitable both for women and men.
Like that, they can be worn happily in all seasons. Some other best trees will yield gemlike
marvelous decorations applicable to noblesse. 
"There are other trees that produce wooden beds with astonishing upholsteries, and
even garlands that will be attractively heartening, while some other trees will be yielding juices
and foodstuffs that are relevant to highly choicest consumers. 
"The females of Uttara Kuru province will be handsome and youthful and they are rich
by their attributes. There the radiantly bright celestials like Gandharva-s, kinnara-s, siddha-s,
vidyaadharaa-s will be delighting along with their females. 
"All the inhabitants of North Kuru have carried out good deeds in earlier births,
hence they are accorded with paradisiacal pleasures now. All are engaged in passion, and all of them
live in pleasure and prosperity along with their youthful females. 
"The notes of vocal and instrumental music will be flowing out mixed with the peals
of vivacious laughter, which will always come to ears in a heart-stealing manner for all beings.

"There is none who is infelicitous and there is none who is friendly to untruthful
ones, and in that province these heart-pleasing attributes of those blessed souls like rejoicing,
festivity etc. will be enriching day by day. 
"On passing beyond that mountain in Uttara Kuru, there is a treasure trove of
waters, namely the vast Northern Ocean, in the middle of which there is a gigantic golden mountain named
Mt. Soma. 
"Those who have gone to the sphere of Indra, and those who have gone to the sphere
of Brahma can see that lordly Mt. Soma, situated in the vast ocean from the vast of
heavens. 
"Even though that place is sunless it is comprehensible as if with sunshine, since
it is illuminated with the resplendence of Mt. Soma itself, which will be irradiating that place as
if with the resplendence of the Sun. 
"The God and Cosmic-Souled Vishnu and Shambhu or Shiva, an embodiment of eleven
selfsame Souls, calledekaadasha rudra-s, and the god of gods Brahma
who is surrounded by Brahma-Sages, will be sojourning on Mt. Soma. 
"Under any circumstances, you shall not go to the north of Kuru province as there is
no other way out to follow, even for other beings likedaitya, daanava,
yaksha, gandharva-s, though they possess some extraordinary capabilities. 
"That mountain named Soma is an impassable one even for gods, and it will be apt of
you to quickly return from there on seeing that mountain. 
" It is possible for the vanara-s to go only up to there, oh, best vanara-s, and we
have no knowledge of those sunless and boundless realms available far and beyond. 
"You shall thoroughly search in all those provinces that are explained by me, and
you have to make up your mind for searching in other places that are not referred by me.

"Thereby, oh, Air-godlike and Wind-godlike vanara-s, on your seeing the princess
born in Videha kingdom, namely Vaidehi, an extremely desirable task for the sake of Dasharatha's
son Rama is considered as done. Thereby it becomes a still privileged accomplishment even for me
achieved through your efforts. 
"Thereafter, oh, fly-jumpers, when you with accomplished purpose and adored by me
with heart-pleasing concessions, and when your enemies are silenced, you will rove over the earth
with your friends and relatives and with your beloveds, also fostering your progeny." Thus Sugreeva
said to the monkeys going to North. 
On sending monkeys in the southern direction Sugreeva spoke to a vanara named Sushena
who looked like a massive cloud. 
On approaching and venerating that awesomely valorous Sushena, the father of Lady
Tara, thereby his father-in-law, King Sugreeva spoke this sentence while adjoining palms in
supplication. 
Sugreeva ordered the superb monkey son of great-sage Mareecha, called Arcishman, to
western direction, who is surrounded by exceptional and braving monkeys, a coequal to Indra in
his resplendence, endowed with brilliance and bravery and whose speed equals that of the son of
Vinata, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu. Along with him Sugreeva also ordered the
greatly mighty brothers of Arcishman i.e., the other vanara sons of Sage Mareecha, known as
Arcishmaalyaa-s, also called as Mareecha-s. 
"Oh, outstanding monkeys, you shall search for Vaidehi proceeding with two hundred
thousand monkeys, say two lakhs, and Sushena as your leader." Thus, Sugreeva started to speak to
the vanara troops. 
"Oh, best monkeys, search the Suraashtra, Baahlika, and Candracitra
provinces, including their extensive and delightful rural areas and spacious cities, as well as in
their woods with Punnaaga trees, areas filled with Vakula, and Uddalaka trees, and in their
interiors, and even in the thickets of Ketaka trees. 
"Oh, vanara-s, search at the best rivers in the west whose cool water flows
westward, as well as in the forests of sages and on the mountains of those forests, and even in
lands that are virtually waterless and on the highly towering mountains that are chilly. On
searching such an impassable western quarter encircled with enmeshed mountains, then it will be apt
of you to come and see the Western Ocean. Having come to the Western Ocean, you will see seawater ruffled
by sharks and crocodiles. 
"Later the monkeys may ramble in the shrubberies of Ketaka plants, in copses of
Tamaala plants and in the boscages of coconut trees. 
"Seetha shall be searched along with the residency of Ravana on the mountains that
are sitting pretty on the seashore, as well as in the forests on those mountains. Further, the
delightful cities available alongshore like Muraci, Jaatapura, Avanti, and Angalepa are to be
searched together with the forest of Alakshita, including the nearby provinces and spacious
townships. 
"At the junction of River Sindhu with the ocean, Mouth of Indus, there is a huge
a mountain named Hemagiri, Golden Mountain, which has hundreds of summits and gigantic trees.

"On the beautiful ridges of that mountain, flying lions are inhibiting and they will
be winching sharks, fish, and elephant seals to their lairs. 
"The elephants inhibiting on the top of that mountain are contended and conceited,
and trumpeting like thunderous clouds they will be moving everywhere in that vast area of the
mountain abutted by water and near the lairs of flying lions. 
"The monkeys who can change their guise by their wish have to quickly and entirely
search the golden peak of that Hemagiri which will be touching the sky and has amazing trees
on it. 
"On your seagoing there, oh, vanara-s, you will see the golden peak of a waterlogged
the mountain called Mt. Paariyaatra, whose peak will be a hundred yojana-s in height, and which is
difficult to see as it will be blindingly glittering. 
"Twenty-four crores of mighty and atrocious Gandharva-s whose glow is similar to the
fire and those who can change their guise at their wish are living there on that mountain Paariyaatra.

"If those Gandharva-s who resemble the tongues of fire are offended, they will
be thronging together from everywhere, as such even courageous vanara-s shall not provoke
them. 
"And the fly-jumpers shall not pluck at least a fruit in that province. Because
those assiduous, highly mighty, and valiant Gandharva-s are impossible for overtures, isn't it?
Moreover, those appallingly audacious Gandharva-s will be safeguarding fruits and tubers there.

"There you have to put yourself in devoir and search for Janaki. In the event of
your following just monkeyhood and its antics, without becoming adventuresome, there will be no
scare from those Gandharva-s. Then you proceed from Mt. Paariyaatra to Mt. Vajra.

"Oh, fly-jumpers, there is a great mountain named Mt. Vajra in that sea beyond Mt.
Paariyaatra. It will have a shine similar to the hue of the gemstone lapis, and it will stand like a diamond in its shape, hence it is diamondiferous. There that glorious mountain will
be soaring high, squarely for a hundred yojana-s and diverse trees and climbers will be spreading
over it. There, on that mountain, you have to search pursuantly including its caverns. [--,
]
"In the fourth quarter of that ocean from land, a mountain named Cakravaan is there.
Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect, constructed a thousand-spoked wheel on it. 
puraaNa/Legend: "Once upon a time in the crusades of gods-demons, Vishnu assuming
the form of ofpuroSottama'Supreme Person' slew the horse-faced demon
named Hayagreeva on that mountain and snatched away the wheel-weapon from him. Until then, this
wheel-weapon existed under the custody of that demon Hayagreeva. Purushottama also put another
demon Pancajana to death on that very mountain and took away his backbone, which is a conch shell.
Thus the conch shell handled by Vishnu is known as Pancha janya
shankha'Paanchajanya conch.' Thus, this Cakravaan-named mountain assumes legendary
importance in to search for Seetha. 
"Vaidehi is to be searched on the delightful cliffs of Mt. Cakravaan and also
in its spacious caves, together with Ravana, and search for her here, there, and everywhere.

"After sixty-four yojana-s another very great mountain with golden peaks is there in
the abyss of the abode of the Rain-god, namely the ocean, and it is named Mt. Varaaha. 
"A city named Praagjyotisha is there which is completely golden, wherein the
evil-minded demon named Naraka is living. 
"They're on the delightful cliffs and spacious caves of Mt. Varaaha, including
that city Praagjyotisha, Ravana shall be searched together with Vaidehi. 
"On ranging from that best Mt. Varaaha, whose caves are inlaid with gold-deposits
apparent to the naked eye, there is an entirely golden mountain containing waterfalls and rapids
called Meghavanta. 
"Listening to the sonorous sounds of waterfalls and rapids of that mountain, and
construing them to be the roars of their opponent beasts, the elephants, wild boars, lions, and
tigers will always be facing that mountain and roaring proud-heartedly all around it, by which that
Mt. Meghavanta itself appears to be roaring, proud-heartedly. 
"On which mountain the distinguished Mahendra, whose horses are green and who is the
controller of demon Paka, is anointed by gods as their king, such a mountain is this named Mt.
Megha, or Mt. Meghavanta, which you have to scour. 
"Ongoing further from that best mountain ruled by Mahendra, namely Mt. Meghavanta,
you shall go to the range of sixty thousand golden mountains. Those mountains are radiant all
around with the tinge of young Sun and with the resplendence of fully flowered trees which are
wholly golden in hue. 
"There is a unique and kingly mountain amid that range of golden
mountains, which is called Mt. Meru, or Saavrni Meru, to which mountain generous Sun has once given
a boon. 
"The Sun said to that unique Mt. Meru Saavarni in this way, 'By my beneficence
whatever that is sheltered by you, say trees, climbers, rapids, boulders, all of them will
transmute into a golden hue, either by day or by night. Even those that reside on you, say gods,
Gandharva-s, or demons, they too shall thrive as my votaries, and as far as their resplendence is
concerned they will be glittering like gold, i.e., in the ochry golden hue of the eventide.

"On their coming to that unique mountain Mt. Meru Saavarni at Vespers Vishvedeva-s,
Vasava-s, Marut-s, and the other celestials will bide their time for the dusking Sun, and when they
all have worshipped him, the Sun goes to Mt. Astagiri, the Dusking Mountain, and evanishes for
all beings for that day. 
"The Sun courses across those ten thousand yojana-s from Mt. Meru Saavarni to Mt.
Astaadri in one and a half hours, and quickly reaches Mt. Astagiri or Mt. Dusk. 
"On the pinnacle of Mt. Astagiri or Mt. Dusk, there is a supreme and heavenly
manor-house compacted with multi-storied buildings, which in shine will be similar to Sun and which
is arranged by Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect. 
"That villa is brightened by amazing trees, on which diverse birds will be
twittering musically belongs to the great-souled Varuna, the Rain god, who wields a tether.

"In between Mt. Meru and Mt. Astaadri, there is a gigantic ten-leaved Date-palm-tree,
which is completely golden and shines forth with a marvelous podium. 
"On all those mountains, lakesides and riversides Vaidehi shall be searched together
with Ravana, far and wide. 
"This is where the virtue-knower, an enlightened one by his asceticism, a
selfsame personality to Brahma and one renowned as Sage Merusaavarni indeed resides. 
"And that sage Merusaavarni who is Sun-similar in his shine can be asked, only on
your prostration before him in veneration, about the tidings of Maithili, and her whereabouts.

"On effacing the utter darkness of all the mortal world up to here, the illuminator
of the mortal world and the decliner of night, namely the Sun, will go to Mt. Astagiri, say Mt.
Dusk. 
"The vanara-s can go only up to there, oh, best vanara-s, and we
do not know those sunless and boundless realms available far and beyond. 
"You shall return within a month on knowing about Vaidehi and also about the
residency of Ravana, or on your reaching Mt. Astagiri, say Mt. Dusk. 
"And none shall stay behind for more than a month, and if anyone stays, I have to
exercise coup de grace in his respect. By the way, my valorous father-in-law, namely Sushena, is
proceeding along with you. 
"As achievers of ordered tasks, you shall give heed to all of the orders given by
him. He who is highly dextrous and great mighty such a Sushena is my father-in-law, thus he is a
venerable to me, as well as to you. 
"Even all of you are triumphant ones and indeed archetypes by yourselves, but
instituting him as your archetype you shall search the western direction. 
"We all fulfill ourselves in reciprocating him who has done good to us, only if we
can locate Seetha, the wife of the king of humans whose vitality is unlimited, namely Rama.

"Even if any other task than this is there, that which shall be conducive to this
task, and which shall also be conducive to time, place, and purpose, you shall undertake that task
also on deciding about it among yourselves," Sugreeva spoke thus to the monkeys going to western
direction. 
On hearing the sentences of Sugreeva sedulously, then Sushena and the other
important fly-jumpers took leave of the king of fly-jumpers, namely Sugreeva, and proceeded along
with their troops to that western direction which is well cloistered by Varuna, the
Rain-god. On sending that great vanara force to the east, Sugreeva started to send tried and true
Canara-s to south. 
Sugreeva, the well-informed and brave lord of monkey troops, then beckoned Angada
and the other prominent vanara-s who are valorous ones with full-fledged dash and dare, like the
son of Fire-god Neela, and the exceptional vanara Hanuma, the highly vigorous son of Grandparent
Brahma, namely Jaambavanta, also others like Suhotra, Sharaari, Sharagulma Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya,
Sushena, Vrishabha, Mainda, Dvivida, Sushena, Gandhamaadana, and the two sons of Ritual-fire called
Ulkaamukha, Ananga. 
Sugreeva made the formidably mighty Angada the chief of those valiant monkeys
forming a search party and ordering southern directions for them. 
The king of monkeys Sugreeva gave a picture of some of the highly impassable
countries available in the southern quarter that need an introduction to those prominent monkeys bound
south. 
"Search the thousand-crested Vindhya mountains abounding with numerous trees and
climbers, then the delightful Narmada river coursing a little southerly to that range, which is
adored by great snakes, along with the wonderful River Godavari, as well as River Krishnaveni and Maha
Nadi, and then the greatly auspicious River Varada which is an adoration to great snakes. And the
territories of Mekhala, Utkala, the cities of Dashaarna, kingdoms of Abravanti, Avanti, and
Vidarbha, also thus the charming kingdom of Maheehaka, is to be searched thoroughly. 
"Like that Vanga, Kalinga territories shall be searched along with Kaushika
territories available on their fringes, then cast about the Dandaka forest all over its mountains,
rivers, and its caves, then River Godavari that courses through Dandaka forest, and then the
provinces of Andhra, Pundra, Chola, Pandya, Kerala are to be searched thoroughly. [--,
]
"You shall go to the prosperous Mt. Malaya which is crowded with iron-ore mines as
its vast mouths, and with amazing crests and motley flowered forests. The search shall be carried out
on that great mountain in the places that are with the copses of sandalwood trees. [--,
a]
"From there you shall go and see the divine River Kaaveri there, a receptacle of
limpid waters, to where throngs of apsara-s will be making pleasure trips. 
"You shall see the eminent sage Agastya, whose resplendence is akin to that of the
Sun, and who will be sitting on the top of that highly resplendent Mt. Malaya? 
"And when that great-souled Agastya complaisantly permits you, then you shall leave
that mountain and cross over the great River Taamraparni, a highly cherished river of crocodiles.

"She whose water is overlapped with amazing copses of sandalwood trees and islands
that River Taamrapani will be drifting for a rendezvous with her much-yearned lover, namely the
ocean, as with a young woman who will be coursing to have a rendezvous with her yearned lover.

"From there, on going to the Paandya Kingdome you shall see a fully golden
castle door bracing the compound wall of the fortress, which is decorated with pearls and jewels,
and conduct your search even in that kingdom. 
"Then on reaching the southern ocean, and on taking a resolve about the
purpose of your task, viz., the importance of the mission undertaken vis- -vis your 
capacities to leap the ocean, you reach the glorious Mt. Mahendra. Sage Agastya once penned its one
end in the ocean, and the other end is now visible. That August and the best one among all mountains
will be completely golden with marvelous terraces and trees, and it will be stepping into the ocean on
the other side of the land, and this mountain becomes the jumping-off point for your vanara-s.

"Mt. Mahendra is glorified with numerous kinds of flowered trees and climbers.
Important gods, sages, yaksha-s, and even apsara-s will adore it, and it is overspread with the
groups of Siddha-s and carina-s, and thus it will be heart-stealing for a look. And the
Thousand-eyed Indra will always be visiting Mt. Mahendra on every auspicious day. [--b,
, a]
"There is a dazzling island on the other side of the shore of Mt. Mahendra, which is
breadthwise a hundred yojana-s, and which is an impassable one for humans, and you have to search
that island up to its fringes. 
"Anywise Seetha is searchable especially there on that island because it is the
dwelling place of the king of demons Ravana, who is the coequal of Indra in his resplendence and
which vile-minded demon is to be rooted out. 
"But a well-known demoness named Angaaraka is there in the midst of the southern ocean
who eats prey by grabbing its shadow when flying overhead. 
"In this way, you should clear your doubts about the presence of Seetha at any
doubtable place by thorough searching, and you have to go on searching somewhere else for Seetha,
the wife of the king of people with infinite vitality, namely Rama, only after getting rid of your
doubts about her possible presence at any given place. 
"On crossing over that isle and after a hundred yojana-s a mountain named Pushpitaka
is there in that august ocean, which is adored by the celestials like Siddha-s, carina-s?

"Well-settled in oceanic waters Mt. Pushpitaka will be shining forth with a
resplendence similar to sunrays on one side and with that of moonshine on the other, and it's lofty
crests will look as if they are scribbling on the sky. 
"One of its summits will be golden which the Sun adores, and the other will be
silvery whitish which the Moon adores, and that mountain is unperceivable to the unfaithful ones,
or to the unkind ones or unbelievers. 
"Oh, vanara-s, venerate that Mt. Pushpitaka by bowing your heads and searching it
thoroughly. Then on going across that inviolable mountain and taking a highly impassable route,
there is a mountain named Suuryavaan after fourteen yojana-s from Mt. Pushpitaka. [--,
a]
"On crossing over even that Mt. Suuryavaan after searching, there is a mountain
named Vaidyuta whose trees will be all-time heart-pleasing and they yield fruits satiating every
taste. 
"Oh, vanara-s, you proceed farther after devouring choicest fruits and tubers
growing on Mt. Vaidyuta, and even on consuming precious honey at that place. 
"At that place, a mountain named Kunjara is there which will be pleasing both to eye
and heart, on which Vishvakarma built the mansion of Agastya. 
"There the golden abode of Agastya will be beautifully decorated with numerous
gemstones, and it measures a yojana breadthwise and ten yojana-s in height. 
"There is a city named Bhogavati which is an abode of the snakes. It has broad roads
and is safeguarded from everywhere, and thus it becomes an unvanquishable city. Deadly serpents with
harrowing fangs and fatal venom will be protecting it, in which the highly hazardous king of
serpents, namely Vasuki, will be dwelling. 
"That Bhogavati city is to be searched for Seetha and on coming out of that city,
you have to search even in the fringes surrounding that city including the intermediate zones from
city to its fringes. 
"On crossing over that province, there will be a glorious mountain named Rishabha, as
that great mountain looks like a Holy Bull, and it is replete with every kind of gemstone.

"Whereon the sandalwood trees of ochry-yellowy, lotus-leaf-greenly, sky-blue
colors and even the most attractive sandalwood trees which will be in the glow of Fire are
produced, that mountain is this Rishabha. 
"But never touch those sandalwood trees when you see them, as a genre of Gandharva-s
called Rohita will be protecting that dangerous woodland of sandalwood trees. 
"Five Gandharva kings, namely Shailuusha, Gramani, Shiksha, Shuka, and Bhabru, whose
resplendence is similar to that of Sun will be residing there. It is also the dwelling place of
those who achieved ethereality by their pious activities, of whom some resemble the Sun, some Moon,
and some Fire by their physique. 
"From Mt. Rishabha to the terminus of the earth the invulnerable beings who won
heavens will be staying. After that, farther from the earth there is the most dreadful world of manes,
namely the abode of Yama, the Terminator, and you need not consider going there. 
"You can go or search only up to this point, oh, the best braving vanara-s, as that
world of manes will be encompassed with alarming darkness, and it is the capital city of Yama,
the Terminator. After that, there is no entry into the abode of Yama for the mortals. 
"It will be apt of you to return quickly on knowing the course of Vaidehi after
thoroughly searching all these places in their entirety, and even in those other places you happen
to see, whether I have mentioned them or not. 
"He who returns before a month and informs that 'Seetha is seen,' he enjoys a
comfortable living on a par with me in high-living and luxuries. 
"He who says so will be dearer to me than anyone, rather than my own life in
particular, and even if he has committed many misdeeds he becomes my confidant. 
"You are with infinite might and bravery, and you are born in those hierarchies that
have wide-ranging attributes viz., a gust of the Air-god, gush of Rain-god, the glare of Fire-god, etc.
Conjoining your own attributes to them that are already inherited you start off on your expedient
effort, and you search appropriately with a thinking as to how to regain Seetha. In that way when Tara has submissively argued with words containing probity,
Sumitra gave assent to her perspective as he is soft by his nature. [4-36-1]
And when Lakshmana conceded to that argument of Tara, Sugreeva, the king of
monkey troops, got rid of his highly intense scare of Lakshmana, like the riddance of a dampened
cloth. [4-36-2]
Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, then ripped apart the superb garland which is so far
enwreathing his neck, and which has several strands according to several gratifications, and he also
became sober as though the insobriety is ripped from his mind. [4-36-3]
Sugreeva who is the most powerful one among all vanara-s, then placatingly spoke
this humble sentence to Lakshmana, whose prowess is most formidable. [4-36-4]
"My prosperity, prominence and this perpetual kingdom of monkeys are once mislaid,
but oh, Soumitri, I regained all this just by the beneficence of Rama. [4-36-5]
"Who is capable of requiting Rama, oh, prince Lakshmana, even by a fraction of that
kind of inestimable help taken from him, as that lord is renowned by actions particular to himself,
like daring and eliminating Vali.
"Who is capable of repudiating such a lordly Rama, even by a fraction of one's 
bravery, unless he is prepared to tread that kind of path on which Vali has gone? [4-36-6]
"Virtue-souled Raghava reacquires Seetha and even exterminates Ravana by himself
with his resplendence, while I and my assistance remain only in name. [4-36-7]
"Why some measures of succour need to be extended to him who has ripped
seven gigantic trees, a mountain, and even the earth, all just with one arrow! [4-36-8]
"He who outstretches his bow with a clangour by which the earth with its mountains
quakes, oh, Lakshmana, to him these aides are really of what aid, indeed! [4-36-9]
"Lakshmana, I just can tread behind that king of people, Rama, on his charging to
eliminate enemy Ravana along with all of his vanguards, that's all. [4-36-10]
"If I have overstepped either in faith or friendliness, in the least, that may be
pardoned for I am an attendant of yours. By the way, none is unoffending. [4-36-11]
Lakshmana is pleased with that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking thus and said
this he said to him, indeed, in friendliness. [4-36-12]
"In any way, my brother indeed has a defender with him, oh, king of vanara-s
Sugreeva, especially you, are a defender of your word and a deferential one towards Rama.
[4-36-13]
"With this kind of preponderance and plainness you possess, Sugreeva, you are the
only merited one to enjoy this unexcelled kingdom of monkeys. [4-36-14]
"Before long, Sugreeva, dauntless Rama will be eliminating enemies in a war with you
as his supporter, there is no doubt about it. [4-36-15]
"You are the knower of virtuousness and gratefulness and you do not retreat from
battlegrounds, or, on your word, thus what you have said is conclusive as well as coherent.
[4-36-16]
"Even though one the can know his lapse and speak it up, oh, ablest
among Vanara-s, who is he that behoves outspokenly, excepting my elder brother and you.
[4-36-17]
"You are a coequal to Rama by your valour and vigour and oh, best one among monkeys,
gods have given you after a long time. [4-36-18]
"However, you quickly start from here along with me, oh, brave one, and embolden
your friend who is anguishing in the despoilment of his wife. [4-36-19]
"Oh, friend, on hearing that which querulously spoken by Rama, who is downhearted in
his anguish, I too reflexively spoke bitter words to you, and thus whatever I spoke that may be
pardoned. [4-36-20]The eminent ministers of tree-branch animals then surrounded Sugreeva, who is very much seared in grief and who is still wearing damp cloths, as he just a while ago offered watery oblations to his deceased brother, stood accessible to him.

On going towards the dexterous Rama, whose exploits are effortless, all of those monkeys tarried with their palms adjoined as with the sages tarrying in the presence of Brahma, the Forefather.

Hanuma, the son of Air-god, whose sheen is like that of the golden mountain Meru, and whose visage is like that of the tender sun in its glint, then spoke this sentence reverently adjoining his palms.

"Oh, lord Rama, this magnificent kingdom of deferential monkeys who are armed with the teeth, and whose might is a privileged one - since our might is not dependent on any weapons or other tactical warfare, except our bodily strength - and oh, Kakutstha, that which belongs to his father and forefathers, and that which is otherwise impossible for him to regain, Sugreeva regained such a kingdom with your grace.

"And if you empower, this Sugreeva will enter the promising city Kishkindha along with a group of good-hearted friends, and he will get anointed procedurally with various essences and herbal extracts as its king, and thus he can revamp all the administration.

"He would like to honor you remarkably with garlands and precious gems, hence it will be apt of you to enter this delightful mountain cave, namely Kishkindha, and you may kindly consolidate the congenial affinity between the governor and the governed for the very high exhilaration of Vanara-s." Hanuma appealed to Rama in this way.

When Hanuma said so, Rama the destroyer of valiant foes, an intellectual and an enunciator replied to Hanuma in this way.

"As a conformist to my father's directives, oh, gentle Hanuma, I am not supposed to enter either a village or a city.

"As and when the best one among Vanara-s valorous Sugreeva enters the highly flourishing and statuesquely Kishkindha, he shall be enthroned in the kingdom, immediately and procedurally.

Replying to Hanuma thus, that knower of the etiquette Rama, also spoke to Sugreeva, who is rich in politesse and an imposing one by his might and valor.

"You may even crown this brave Angada as crown prince, he is the eldest son of your elder brother, his bravery is kindred to that of his father, and thus this enthusiastic Angada will be a well-chosen designee for the crown princeship.

"The four-month period specified for the rainy season has commenced, oh gentle Sugreeva, and this is Shravana, the first month of the rainy season that brings many showers.

"This is not a time for any striving, hence you enter the propitious city Kishkindha, oh, gentle Sugreeva, and I for my part will stay on this mountain along with Lakshmana.

"This mountain cave is heart-pleasing by being spacious with worthwhile breeze, oh, gentle one, water is copious and red and blue lotuses are aplenty about this place.

"On the advent of Kartika month, October, say post-rainy season, you shall do your best in the cause of Ravana's elimination, and this is our covenant, and hence oh, gentle Sugreeva, for now, enter your mansion, be enthroned in the kingdom as well, and exhilarate your friends."

Thus when Rama countenanced, that best vanara Sugreeva entered the charming city Kishkindha which is so far ruled by Vali.

When the sovereign of vanara-s Sugreeva entered the city, very gladly thousands of vanara-s also entered and fenced off that lord of fly-jumpers from all over.

All the inmates and ministers in Kishkindha then revered the lord of monkey throngs Sugreeva with their head-bent, and they also prostrated before him with an assiduously polite attitude.

Raising the rank-and-file members from their prostration, and exchanging a word or two with them, that valiant and highly mighty Sugreeva entered the beautiful palace chambers of his brother.

When that prodigiously venturesome arch-vanara Sugreeva entered the palace, his cohorts anointed him as gods would anoint the Thousand-eyed Indra.

A white parasol highly ornates in gold, long-furred royal fans with golden handles that are the enhancers of celebrity are brought for Sugreeva's anointment. Likewise, on taking all kinds of jewels, seeds, herbs, sprouts of trees that are still exuding milky latex, flowers, white royal-robes, and white body cream, lotuses bloomed on dry-land, best sandal paste, also various and numerous perfumes, Holy-yellow-rice, gold, seeds that are small and fragrant called Priyangu, honey, ghee, curds, the skin of tiger, tassels of fragrant flowers, and invaluable sandal shoes, unguents before oil bath, orpiment preparations one in yellow called Gorochana, and the other in red called Manshila, there arrived sixteen best and cheerful damsels.

They, the Vanara-s, have then started to anoint that best Vanara Sugreeva according to the tradition, having appeased the eminent Brahmans with jewels, garments, and delicacies.

Authoritative scholars in Vedic hymns then spread the ritual grass around the Fire-altar which is with enkindled Ritual-fire obligated fire oblations into it duly sanctifying them with hymns.

On a splendid, choicest, and finely upholstered throne with golden legs that are kept atop a rostrum that is shining forth with various flower tassels, Sugreeva is procedurally inducted to sit facing east to the chanting of Vedic hymns. Then, Vanara-s like Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda, Dvividha, also thus Hanuma, Jambavanta have started pouring pure water on Sugreeva, which the best Vanara-s have collected from the rivers flowing to the east, as well as to the west, from each of the sacred declivity of rivers, from every ocean, and stored in golden flasks. Thus those have anointed Sugreeva with those pellucid and well-perfumed waters poured from golden vessels
When the chiefs of monkey troops are on their way Rama speaks to Sugreeva, "Indeed, how do you know very well about 
the globe of earth in its entirety?" 
Then Sugreeva bowed down before Rama said, "I will narrate all vividly, and let my words be heard." 
"When Vali repulsed the buffalo-shaped demon Dundubhi towards Malaya mountain, then that buffalo entered the cave 
of Mt. Malaya, and even Vali entered therein wishing to kill that buffalo. 
"Vali then kept me at the mouth of the cave as I was an amenable brother, but Vali did not exit from the cave even 
after one full year. 
"I was dumbfounded to see that cave is then filled with blood, and then a venom-like anguish called the 
loss of my brother agonized me. 
"Then I concluded that 'my brother is unmistakably killed,' and then I fixed a mountain similar boulder in the 
the mouth of that cavity with thinking that it will be impossible for that buffalo to exit and it will get destroyed 
within that cave itself. 
"Unhopeful of Vali's aliveness then I arrived in Kishkindha, and on getting the very magnificent kingdom of Kishkindha, 
and also Ruma along with Tara, I was peaceably staying there with friends. 
"Vali then came back to Kishkindha to kill that great demon, and then I was spellbound in fear of Vali's killing 
me, and I gave back the kingdom to Vali owing to my deference to him. 
"That evil-minded Vali becoming highly perturbed at his senses furiously repulsed me further and further away, 
even though I was running away from him with my ministers, as he wished to kill me. 
"Such as I was, who is repulsed by Vali, I was made to run away rapidly, and during that fleeing I went on seeing 
diverse rivers, forests, and cities. 
"I have then really seen the earth as in the reflection on the surface of a mirror, where the mirror shows all 
the objects in exactness, and the earth is like the circle of a fireball, where it is encircled with fire-like 
reddish, brownish, ochreish minerals and ores, and it appeared to me in my high flight like a cow-hoof-print in 
the mirror called my perception. 
"Then on going in the eastern direction, I saw various trees, enchanting mountains with caves, and also numerous lakes. 

"There I saw the mountain wreathed in with ores, namely Mt. Udaya, the Sun-Rise, and I have also seen the Milk 
Water Oceans which is forever an abode for apsara-s. 
"I fled speedily when Vali repulsed me, but oh, lord Rama, when I returned he made me to flee forthwith. 

"Then from that eastern direction, I fled to the southern direction, which is thick with Vindhya Range mountains and 
diverse trees, especially with sandalwood trees. 
"While I was seeing the interiors of forest and mountains again I was made to run by Vali, who was setting upon 
me from within the interiors of those forests and mountains, and then I reached the western direction. 
"Such as I was, on seeing diverse cities and the best mountain Astagiri, Mt. Dusk, I reached that excellent Mt. 
Dusk also, and since Vali was at my heel, I took to my heels, by a long way north. 
"Even at the Himalayas, Mt. Meru, like that at the Northern Ocean, Vali drove me back, and when the clemency from 
Vali, or a shelter, or even a foothold on earth was indeterminable, then Hanuma, whose prosperity is his wisdom, 
said a word to me. 
" 'Oh, King Sugreeva, now I remember how Sage Matanga cursed the king of monkeys Vali at that time. If Vali  
enters the fringes of the hermitage of Sage Matanga, Vali's head gets splintered in a hundred ways. Hence dwelling 
in sage Matanga's hermitage will be peaceful and imperturbable for us.' Thus Hanuma spoke to me. [--b, , 
a]
"Oh, Prince Rama, then Vali though reached Mt. Rishyamuka, he did not enter into its precincts at that time fearing 
Sage Matanga and his curse, oh, King Rama, thus this globe of the earth is apparently and closely sighted by me in 
its entirety, and then I came into the cave of Rishyamuka and did not stir out." So said Sugreeva to Rama. [--b, 
]Then Sugreeva who is gladdened again spoke to Rama of Raghu's dynasty, "My best minister and this servant of yours Hanuma informed me of the reason for which you have come to uninhabited forests along with your brother Lakshmana, and that while living in the forest, and when you and this courageous Lakshmana are not here alongside a demon that stole your wife Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, wailing as she was.
"And he also said about that arch demon's killing an eagle named Jatayu on waiting for an opportunity, and his causing agony in you by way of separating your wife.
"Before long you will get rid of your agony caused by the separation of wife, for I will fetch her very soon, like the retrieval Vedic Scriptures.
"Oh! Enemy destroyer, Rama, I will fetch your wife to give her to you whether she is in netherworlds or even in empyrean worlds.
"You may know that this word of mine is definite oh, Raghava. Your wife is as good as an indigestible foodstuff made with poison, indigestive even to Indra, put together with all gods and demons.
"Give up your lamentation, oh, great-shouldered one, for I will bring back that lady for you. And by inference, I know her... undoubtedly I have seen Maithilee while that demon with cruel deeds were abducting her... then she was crying piteously calling 'Rama, Rama...' and also calling 'Lakshmana...' and she was writhing in the flanks of Ravana like the wife of a serpent's lord...
"Myself being the fifth one on the cliff of the mountain, on seeing me she dropped the upper cloth of her sari along with auspicious jewellery.
"We took those jewellery items and stored them, Raaghava... I will get them and it will be apt of you to identify them..." thus said Sugreeva to Rama.
Then Rama said to that pleasant talker Sugreeva, "Get them quickly, my friend, what for you are delaying."
Thus said Sugreeva then entered the cavernous cave of that mountain quickly, to fulfill the yearning of Raghava.
On taking and bringing the parcel of that upper cloth with the auspicious jewellery, "This, you see..." saying thus that monkey started to show them to Rama.
Then on taking that cloth and also the auspicious jewellery, Rama became like mist mist-filled moon with overfilling tears.
But he who is blemished by tears that outpoured in all his friendship with Seetha, leaving off his courage fell on the ground wailing, 'oh, dear... oh, dear...'
The more he hugged those best decorative ornaments close to his heart, the more he hissed like a wrathful serpent in a snake pit.
With the unending rush of tears, he saw Lakshmana at his side and started to wail piteously.
"Lakshmana, see this upper cloth and these ornaments too of Vaidehi, shed from her body and dropped onto the ground while she was being abducted.
"Seetha must have dropped these ornaments onto pastureland, for they appear to be in their original shape, indeed." So said Rama to Lakshmana.
When Rama thus said Lakshmana said this, "I know not the bracelets and I know not the earrings But because I always salute her feet I know these anklets well...
" Then Rama sadly asked Sugreeva, "Tell me Sugreeva, towards which country that ferocious-looking demon abducted my dear one dearest than my lives, as spotted by you...
"For the sake of which demon I wish to eliminate the whole of the demons, that troublemaker of mine, where does he live, either...
"By whom Maithili is abducted and thus caused indignation in me, he has opened up the doors of his death suicidally.
"Oh, king of the fly-jumpers, tell me which demon forcibly stole her, my dearest one than all, by molesting her in the forest, tell me about that enemy of mine, for sure I will lead him to the fore of Death today itself...While Tara with a face that shines like the lord of stars is speaking thus, Vali dauntingly speaks to 
her with these words.
"He is a younger brother and an adversary in particular, oh, pretty-faced Tara, can I by any reason 
tolerate him when he kept raving on frenetically, tell me. 
"To those valiant ones who neither give ground nor get assailed in wars, oh, shyly, the endurance of an overweening 
war-whoop is more than death. 
"I am incapable of withstanding that dumbly Sugreeva's bawling commotion desiring a brawling duel. 
"Also, you need not bother about Raghava's doing some harm to me, as I wonder how a diligent man and 
knower of virtue can sin. 
"How do you follow me again, you return with all these females, truly you have expressed your friendliness 
owing to your devotion to me. 
"You may do away with your perplexity as I will retaliate Sugreeva on my going there only to drive him 
and his arrogance out, but without letting his life loose. 
"As he is firmed up for combat, I will indeed have to effectuate what his desire is, by caning with 
trees and fistfights, by which roughed up he returns. 
"My nerve and pace of combat will be insufferable to that malign-minded Sugreeva, oh, Tara, you have 
offered your helping suggestion and you have shown all your friendliness to me, it is enough. 
"I adjured you on my lives, return with your followers, and I shall return to you on easily defeating 
and returning that 'brother of mine." Said Vali to Tara. 
She that pleasant articulator and talented Tara then hugged and circumambulated Vali, suppressing her 
moaning, as an honour to the braver. 
Then she who is a hymnodist that Tara has performed a hymnal bon voyage wishing triumph for Vali, and 
entered palace chambers along with other females, disoriented by her sadness. 
On Tara entering her palace chambers along with other females, Vali emerged out of the city hissing 
like an infuriated great snake. 
He that highly rancorous Vali suspired with high audacity and spread his sight everywhere intending 
to sight his enemy. 
Then that celebrated Vali saw Sugreeva who is in golden-ochre hue, whose girdle cloth is tightened for 
a fight, and who is with an air of self-confidence, blazing like fiery fire. 
That strong-armed Vali who is highly provoked has also tightened his girdle cloth on seeing proximately 
available Sugreeva. 
He that formidable Vali strongly tightened his girdle-cloth too, and proceeded towards Sugreeva in 
a well-timed manner uplifting fists to fight him off. 
Even Sugreeva has come at that imprudent Vali with a golden pendant, tightening his fists, lifting 
them at the ready, and aiming them well at Vali. 
Vali spoke this word to that Sugreeva who was swooping down on him, whose eyes were reddened in fury, 
and who is an expert and expeditious in fighting. 
"Properly clenching fingers this great fist of mine is firmly clenched, and it will unclench only on 
taking your lives when I pitch this on you at full speed." So said Vali threateningly to Sugreeva. 
Thus said, Sugreeva with high dudgeon said, "This fist of mine shall fall on your forehead plundering 
your lives." 
Coming near instantaneously Vali hit him, whereby Sugreeva was enraged and became like a mountain streaming 
blood in its torrents. 
But Sugreeva unhesitatingly uprooted a small tree with his force and thrashed the limbs of Vali as with 
the thunderbolt thrashing a great mountain. 
But Vali when thwacked by a saala tree had staggered and looked like a tossing ship in an ocean-filled 
with the heavy weight of merchandise and brimming with merchants, but on the brink of wrecking. 
Those two, Vali and Sugreeva, with their sensational energy, triumphing zeal, frightful physiques, swiftness 
as good as the Divine Eagle Garuda, vigilance in exploring perilous body parts of one another, ravagement 
of their enemies fought frighteningly, like the sun and moon in the sky, which is inconceivable. 

But Vali being the possessor of might and vigour progressed and though greatly mighty son of the sun, 
Sugreeva regressed. 
Sugreeva became retardant in aggression when Vali routed his pride and then he exasperatedly started 
searching for Raghava to counteract Vali. 
Among those two there happened a deadly fight time and again using trees with branches, peaks of mountains, 
their nails that are similar to the razor-sharp edges of thunderbolts, and fists, knees, feet, 
and arms, like the fight that once chanced between the demon Vritra and Indra. 
Those forest moving vanara-s that are soaked in blood have gone on clashing, threatening each other, 
like two clouds clashing uproariously. 
Raghava has then seen the lord of monkeys Sugreeva who is repeatedly eyeing all sides for help and who 
is even deteriorating in his enterprise. 
On seeing the lord of monkeys Sugreeva in a forlornness, then the refulgent and fearless Rama scanned 
for an arrow aiming to eliminate Vali.
Then on tautening a venomous serpent-like arrow in the bow, Rama started to draw out the bowstring, whereby 
that bow attained a similitude with the Time-disc of the Terminator. 
At the blast of the bowstring, the lordly birds and animals are panicked, like those that will be startled 
by the approach of ear end, and they all fled.
The arrow released by Raghava has the boom of thunderbolt thunderclap and the flashes of lightning 
fall on the chest of Vali.
Hit by the fleetness of that arrow then that highly magnificent and intrepid lord of monkeys Vali fell 
onto the plane of Earth. 
Like the flag that will be raised in honour of Indra during the month of Ashwin on a full moon day, 
but thrown onto earth along with its flagstaff after the festival, Vali with depleted energy and dissipated 
vitality slowly fell onto the ground, and with tears blocking their throat he moaned piteously.
That best one among men Rama released a blazing and enemy-subjugating arrow which in simile is like 
an Epoch-ender at the end of the era, and that best arrow decorated in gold and silver looked like the glance 
from the Third Eye of Rudra, emitting fire with smoke. 
That Indra's son Vali, dampened with blood and sweat, then looked like just felled Ashoka tree which 
has stemmed up and so far standing high on a mountain with fully bloomed clusters of its blood-red flowers, 
and when his anima is undone he even looked like the flagstaff on which a flag is raised in honour of 
Indra, but which is altogether dislodged and abandoned on the ground. While Rama, the son of Dasaratha, crossed the ocean along with his army, the
illustrious Ravana spoke to Shuka and Sarana, his ministers as follows:
"The entire army of monkeys crossed the impassable ocean. The construction of the
bridge, unprecedented, across the ocean was executed by Rama."
"I am not able to believe under any circumstances that a pass-way has been
constructed across the ocean. Certainly, that army of monkeys is worth to be counted (carried
weight) by me."
"Become unrecognisable to others, enter the army of monkeys and make out the real
quantum of their army, their prowess, as to which monkeys are important among them, which ministers
of Rama and Sugreeva have come together, which monkeys are abiding in front, which monkeys are
valiant, how that bridge was constructed across the ocean full of water, how the encamping is done
for those great-souled monkeys; the determination, strength and the striking senses of Rama and of
the heroic Lakshmana."
"Knowing also accurately who the Chief of Army of those high-souled monkeys is, you
have to come back quickly."
Having thus been commanded by Ravana, the valiant demons Shuka and Sarana , both in
the disguise of monkeys, entered that army of monkeys.
Shuka and Sarana were not able to count then that inconeviable army of monkeys,
causing their hair to stand on end.
That army was stationed on the tops of mountains, round about the waterfalls, in the
caves, on the sea-shores, in the woodlands and in the gardens. It was either in the process of
crossing the ocean, or was intending to cross it in its entirety. It had either encamped or was
still encamping, making a terrible noise. The two demons saw that very strong and imperturbable sea
of army.
Vibhishana with great splendour beheld both of them in disguise. He caught hold of
Shuka and Sarana and told Rama as follows:
"O, Rama the conqueror of hostile citadels! These two demons are Shuka and Sarana,
the ministers of Ravana and they came here as spies from Lanka."
Both of them, having seen Rama, were trembled with fear, without any hope for their
lives and having joined their palms, spoke the following words:
"O, excellent man! O, Rama! We both of us, as sent by Ravana, came here together to
know everything about your entire army."
Hearing their aforesaid words, Rama the son of Dasaratha who was interested in the
welfare of all beings, smilingly spoke the following words:
"Has the entire army been observed by you? Have you observed us well? Have you
accomplished the task, as entrusted to you? If so, you may go back now according to your free
will."
"Even if you have not seen something you may see it now also. Otherwise, Vibhishana
will show it to you again entirely."
"You, having been caught, need not fear about your life. The captured messengers
holding no weapons indeed deserve no killing."
"O, Vibhishana! Always try to draw a bow-string on the opponents and not on these
two demons. Set them both, who are spies in disguise, free."
"When you return to the city of Lanka, repeat my words faithfully to Ravana the
younger half-brother of Kubera and the king of demons."
"That force on which you relied when you were taking away Seetha from me, display
that force at your will along with your troops and allies."
"Tomorrow, at break of day, you will see my arrows demolish the city of Lanka with
its ramparts and arches as well as the army of demons."
"O, Ravana! Tomorrow, at break of day I will cast my dreadful anger on you and your
army as Indra the Lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt casts the thunderbolt on demons."
Receiving this command, the two demons, Shuka and Sarana, admiring his justice,
cried out: "May you be victorious!", reached the city of Lanka and spoke to Ravana as follows:
"O, king of demons! We were seized by Vibhishana with the intention of killing us.
But, Rama, the pious minded wose valour is immeasurable, seeing us, set us free."
"Where the four eminent persons who are equal to the protector of the worlds, the
valiant ones skilled in the use of weapons and of proven prowess namely Rama the son of Dasaratha,
the illustrious Lakshmana, the great resplendent Vibhishana and Sgreeva whose valour is equal to
Indra the Lord of celestials, arestationed at the same place, they can pluck up the city of Lanka
with its ramparts and arches and transplant it elswhere, even if all the monkeys keep aloof."
"Such is Rama's form and such are his weapons, that he can alone overthrow the city
of Lanka, his three other companious standing by."
"That army protected by Rama and Lakshmana as well as Sugreeva, are exceedingly
unconquerable even by all the gods and demons."
"Now, the army of the mighty monkeys, who are readily inclined to fight, consists of
cheerful warriors. Mae peace, insted of enmity with them. Restore Seetha to Rama."Those brahmans skilled in Vedas stayed there all the night and arrived at a nearby place along with the royal priest, Vashishta.
Ministers, army chiefs, prominent leaders of the city assembled there, welcoming the cause of Rama's coronation.
The best of brahmanas were prepared to do Rama's coronation in day-time after the sun rises clearly at the arrival of Pushya star and on arrival of Rama's auspicious birth time of Cancer.
Golden water-pots, well-decorated throne and chariot covered well by shining tiger-skin were impressive.
Water was brought from auspicious conjunction of rivers ganga and Yamuna, from other rivers, lakes, wells, ponds, from streams flowing eastwards, from streams which joined together and from oceans in all sides.
Gold and silver pots filled with best water together with popped grain and covered by milky sapped leaves, lotuses and water-lilies were shining there.
Honey, curd, clarified butter popped grain, sacred grass, flowers and milk were kept ready. Harlots adorned with all types of ornaments were also glimmering there.
An excellent fly-flopper which was like spread-out rays of moon, made of gold, adorned with diamonds was kept ready for Rama.
A white umbrella like circular moon, which was kept in advance for the occasion of coronation was also kept ready.
A white bull, a white horse a mighty and beautiful elephant which was fit to be mounted by kings were readily waiting.
Eight auspicious virgins adorned all types of ornaments, various types of musical instruments, panegyrists and others were also waiting.
The people who gathered there after getting the things required as per orders of king for coronation ceremony to be held in a kingdom of Ikshhvaaku dynasty, could not sight the king and discussed among themselves about how to inform the king regarding their arrival.
" The king is not being seen. The sun has risen. Everything is ready for the coronation of Rama, the wise".
Sumantra, who received good respect from Dasaratha, heard them thus speaking and addressed those kings, who came from different countries.
"I am going to Rama quickly as per king's directions. But, you are all worthy of worship by Dasaratha and by Rama in particular."
"I shall ask as your word about the well-being of king who is now awake and also about the reason of his not coming here."
That Sumantra, knower of sacred works spoke thus, approached entrance of royal palace and entered the inner quarters which is always kept closed.
He entered the inner quarters and praised the king's dynasty. He approached the royal bedroom and stood there at a distance.
He entered the bedroom, approached nearer to the curtain there and praised Dasaratha's qualities with blessings.
"Oh, king Dasaratha! Let sun and the moon, guardians of the world like Shiva and Kubera, Varuna, Agni and Indra grant victory to you!"
"Oh, the best of kings! The venerable night has gone. The auspicious day has come. Wake up and do whatever needs to be done thereafter."
"Oh, king Dasaratha ! Brahmanas, chiefs of armed forces and traders are waiting to see you. Please wake up."
Then, Dasaratha woke up and spoke these words to Sumantra, who was eulogising him, who was skilled in giving advice and who was his charioteer.
"Why have you not followed my orders even though you were asked by her to bring Rama."
King Dasaratha ordered that charioteer there again thus - " I am not sleeping. Bring Rama here soon".
He listened to king's words, bowed his head in salutation to him, thought for goodness of king, and came out of the king's palace.
That Sumantra with placid mind, went happily seeing the royal roads adorned with flags and banners.
Sumantra heard the words pertaining to Rama and Rama's coronation spoken together by joyful people there.
Then, Sumantra saw Rama's palace which was lovely shining like top of a mountain and radiant like Indra's palace.
Rama's palace was beautiful with large doors and adorned with hundreds of raised quadrangular seats. There were festooned decorations over doorways with gems and corals. It was adorned with various precious stones and the best of garlands. Pearls were scattered all over abundantly. It was decorated with sandal and aloe woods, spreading out beautiful smells like the peak of a Darddura Mountain. Cranes and peacocks were singing sweetly. Figures of wolves and other art forms were sculptured here and there. 
It was attracting the eyes and minds of living beings by its brilliance. It was shining like a constellation of moon and the sun. It was full of various kinds of birds. It was as high as Meru mountain. Sumantra saw such a palace of Rama. People who came from different rural parts to see Rama's coronation were 
waiting with different gifts in their hands. That house decorated with various diamonds, was looking high like a great cloud. Hunch backed servants and servants of kirata tribe were moving all over the house.
That Sumantra with chariot fastened with horses and having a top, approached towards Rama's palace, beautifying the human and the royal races, gladdened the hearts of all citizens.
That palace of the great souled Rama was like Indra's palace with great wealth. It was filled with various deer and peacocks. After approaching that palace, he became quite thrilled.
The inner apartments of Rama's palace were well decorated, high as Kailasa mountain and like abodes of deities. Sumantra entered there, passed over many of Rama's friends who well wishers and approached Rama's inner apartment.
There, Sumantra heard delightful people talking about Rama's coronation and the rites to be performed for the sake of Rama's prosperity.
Rama's palace was as high as top of the Meru mountain, shining with radiance. The mansion was filled with birds and antelopes. It was like Indra's mansion. Sumantra saw such a beautiful house of Rama.
He saw crores and millions of rural folk and other people with folded hands approaching the area leaving their respective vehicles.
There he saw a beautiful elephant called Satrunjaya with highly elevated body and Rama's royal conveyance. It was like a great cloud and a mountain. It was intoxicated, uncontrollable and intolerable.
The ministers in chief who were beloved to the king, were well-adorned and came there on horse-carriages and elephants. Sumantra passed over the people gathered there on all sides and entered the rich inner apartment.
Then, that Sumantra entered Rama's palace, which was like top of a mountain, like an unmoving cloud, which contained houses equal to excellent divine cars, like crocodile entering the ocean containing a number of precious stones. Nobody obstructed him.Thereafter, the king when recovered from loss of consciousness and again returned to his breath, he called that charioteer for the purpose of getting the report on Rama.
Then, Sumantra, who joined his palms in reverence, approached the monarch who was
repenting about Rama alone, filled with pain and sorrow, advanced in age, greatly anguished, sighing like a newly caught elephant and reflecting on something as a sick elephant.
The king, having great distress, spoke to Sumantra, whose body was covered with
dust, his face filled with tears, who was miserable and who approached near him (as follows): "Oh, Sumantra! Where can Rama the virtuous man abide, taking refuge at the root of a tree? What that Rama, who enjoyed very many pleasantries, can eat now?"
"Oh, Sumantra! How can Rama the prince, who was habituated to good beds, sleep with such discomfort on a floor like an orphan?"
"Foot soldiers, Chariots and elephants used to follows whenever Rama was marching
ahead. How such a man can take shelter and stay in a forest devoid of people?"
"How Seetha Rama and Lakshmana entered forest filled with wild animals and black
snakes?"
"Oh, Sumantra! How those princes with Seetha the delicate and the poor lady went on foot, after descending from the chariot?"
"Oh, Sumantra! You have seen my sons entering the forest, as though divinities of
Aswini had entered the Mountain-range of Mandara. You are indeed lucky."
"Oh, Sumantra! After reaching the forest, what words did Rama speak? What did
Lakshmana speak? What did Seetha speak?"
"Oh, charioteer! Tell me where Rama sat, slept and took food. By hearing these
things, I shall survive, as Yayati survived in the company of saints."
As asked thus by the king, Sumantra spoke to the emperor in a voice quivering and
choked with tears (as follows).
"Oh, emperor! Rama, keeping up the prescribed course of conduct, making salutation with joined palms and bowing his head in reverence to you, spoke to me as follows:"
"Oh, charioteer! Tell my salutations to my father, the one with a remarkable
intellect, a mighty soul and the one to be respectfully greeted."
Oh, charioteer! Enquire about the health of all the people in the gynaeceum without any disparity and offer my appropriate salutations to them.
My mother Kausalya is to be told about my welfare, about my offering salutations to her and about my meticulousness.
"Oh, godly lady! Be always righteous and be interested in offering worship and
sacrifices as per the prescribed timings in the House of Fire worship. Nurture the feet of the Lord Dasaratha, like with a god."
"Oh, mother! Behave towards my other mothers, abandoning self-conceit and
indignation. Make the venerable Kaikeyi, agreeable to the king."
"In respect of Bharata your son, follow a respectable behaviour as with a king.
Kings are indeed sovereign in substance. Remember the rules relating to kings."
"Bharata is to be enquired about his well-being and he is also to be informed as
follows: "Follow good behaviour indeed judiciously towards all your mothers."
"The mighty armed Bharata the son of Ikshvaku race, is to be told as follows: Being installed in the office of Prince Regent, attend to your father who still stays in the throne'."
"The king has crossed his age. But do not depose him on that score. By proceeding
according to the orders of the king, you live as a prince."
"Shedding tears profusely, Rama again spoke to me as follows : My mother, who is
very much longing her son, is to be looked after by you as if she is your mother."
"Oh, emperor! Rama of the most beautiful appearance with red eyes resembling red
lotus flowers, while even uttering these words to me profusely shed tears."
"But Lakshmana was very angry and breathing a sigh, spoke to me as follows:  On
which offence this prince was expelled from home?'"
"The king even took shelter under a wretched decree of Kaikeyi and performed an act not to be done, as though it is a proper deed, for which we are now tormented."
"Even if this was done for the good pleasure of the king or through the will of God, I do not see any justification for Rama's abandonment."
"Even if this was done for the good pleasure of the king or through the will of god,
I do not see any justification for Rama's abandonment."
"Rama's exile, an illegal decision undertaken whether due to levity of judgment or due to lack of reflection, will raise countless protests."
"I do not consider the emperor as my father. For me, Rama is the brother, lord,
relative and my father."
"Leaving Rama the beloved of all people and who is interested in the welfare of all human beings, how would all these people would be interested in you by this act of yours?"
"By banishing Rama who is delightful to entire people and who is a virtuous man and by opposing all this entire world, how will you stay as a king?"
"Oh, King! The wise Seetha for her part with her mind like one possessed and
forgetting her own existence, stood sighing and static.
"The illustrious Seetha having not seen such misfortune earlier, could not even to speak me anything, weeping as she was with that uneasiness."
"Seeing me going back, Seetha with emaciated face, perceiving her husband, soon shed down tears."
"In the same way, Rama with tears on his face and with joined palms, stood being
shielded by the arms of Lakshmana. The miserable Seetha in the same manner was weeping and seeing the royal chariot and me."While Rama landed upon the southern shore, Guha conversed for a long time with
Sumantra and with much distress, went to his house.
It was gathered by those who were there (Guha and others) about Seetha, Rama and
Lakshmana coming to sage Bharadwaja, their staying with him in Prayaga and their departure to Chitrakuta Mountain.
Sumantra, being allowed to depart by Rama, tied excellent horses to the chariot and with intense anguish, rode towards the very city of Ayodhya.
Sumantra, seeing the sweet-smelling woods, rivers, lakes, villages and towns on the way, soon crossed them.
Reaching Ayodhya in the evening time of the third day Sumantra saw that city,
joyless.
Beholding Ayodhya as if deserted in silence, Sumantra becoming very much distressed in mind and having afflicted with intense anguish, surmised as follows: "I hope the city of Ayodhya with its elephants, horses, people and the kings was not burnt away by a fire of sorrow and blazing grief towards Rama.
Sumantra, thus lost in thought, reaching the city-gate through the fast-running
horses, entered the city quickly.
Meanwhile, seeing Sumantra the charioteer approaching, hundreds and thousands of
people ran towards him asking, "Where is Rama?"
He replied them thus: "Bidding farewell to Rama at the shore of Ganga when sent back by that virtuous and high-souled Rama, I returned here."
Hearing that Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana had crossed River Ganga, the people with
their faces filled with tears sighed, "Oh, fie upon us! And cried aloud, "Alas, Rama!" Sumantra also heard the words of those people standing in groups and telling, "Lost indeed are we, who do not see Rama here!"
"Never again can we see the pious Rama on the occasions of bestowing gifts,
sacrificial performances or marriages or in large meetings.
The city of Ayodhya was protected by Rama, as by a father, with due regard to what was appropriate, what was congenial and what brought happiness to its people.
While driving through bazaars, Sumantra heard the sounds of lamentation of women,
coming forth from windows, consumed by anguish on account of Rama's exile.
Going through the middle of the royal highway, Sumantra by covering his face,
reached the house of Dasaratha.
Sumantra descended from the chariot, entered quickly the royal palace and traversed the seven inner apartments of the palace, filled with a large number of people. Then, finding the forthcoming Sumantra from their large mansions, from seven-storied buildings and from royal palaces, the women who had been emaciated in not being able to see Rama, cried "Alas! Alas".
Those women, extremely confounded with grief with their long and bright eyes filled with a stream of tears, looked at each other imperceptibly.
Sumantra also heard the feeble conversation of Dasaratha's wives absorbed in anguish on account of Rama's exile, from their respective inner apartments.
"What Sumantra will reply to the lamenting Kausalya, when he now returns here
without Rama while he formerly went out with Rama?"
"In spite of her son (Rama) having left Ayodhya, Kausalya continues to survive. I
think that surely it is difficult thus to live and it is not so easy to preserve it too!"
Hearing those credible words of Dasaratha's wives, Sumantra all at once entered the house, that appeared to be set ablaze with grief.
Sumantra entered the eighth inner apartment and saw in that white house, King
Dasaratha the miserable the sick and the exhausted man on account of the exhausted man on account of the grief for his son.
Sumantra approached that king who was seated, offered his salutation and presented Rama's message as told.
That king heard silently the message of Rama, was bewildered, afflicted by grief,
for his son, became fainted and fell on the ground.
The king thus having fainted, the gynaeceum was hurt. While the king was falling on the ground, the inmates of gynaeceum wept, raising their hands in distress.
Kausalya along with Sumitra lifted up their husband, who fell on the ground.
Kausalya also spoke these words to Dasaratha.
"Oh, illustrious king! Why are you not speaking to this Rama's messenger who came
from the forest and who has done difficult things?"
"Oh, Dasaratha! After doing an evil act, you are now feeling shameful. Rise up! Let it be a meritorious act for you. You cannot get a help, when you weep like this."
"Oh, king! On whose fear, you are not enquiring with Sumantra about the welfare of Rama, that Kaikeyi is not here. Speak fearlessly."
Kausalya, speaking excitedly in tears and entirely given up to anguish uttered thus to the monarch and soon fell to the ground.
All those women cried in loud voice, seeing Kausalya fallen on the ground weeping as aforesaid and gazing their husband too (lying unconscious).
Hearing that crying sound raised in gynaeceum, all aged and young men and women on all sides gathered around weeping. The city then again became disturbed.Then, moving his head all of a sudden sighing again and again, rubbing his hand in hand, grinding his teeth, turning his eyes red with anger shedding his normal colour, overwhelmed with wrath, suddenly getting the evil grief, carefully reading Dasaratha's mind, sumantra the charioteer spoke(as follows) as though shaking Kaikeyi's heart with sharp arrows, in the form of thunderbolting words speedily peircing all her vitals.
"There is nothing on earth, anything which is most disgraceful for you by whom your husband king Dasaratha the supporter of the entire creation the unmoving and the moving, is betrayed, Oh, Kaikeyi!"
"King Dasaratha is unconquerable as great Indra, unshakable as mountain and
imperturbable as a great ocean. By tormenting him with your actions, you are considered by me as murderess of your husband and ultimately the exterminator of your race too."
"Do not despise Dasaratha the supporter, the bestower of boons and your husband. For women, will of the husband is superior to that of ten million sons."
"After death of a king, kingdoms are obtained as per the age of the princes. But,
you want to deprive this condition in the case of Rama the lord of Ikshvaku dynasty."
"Let your son Bharata become the king and rule the earth. wherever Rama goes, we (on our part) shall go there".
"Now any brahmana cannot indeed dwell in your kigdom as now you want to do such an act, transgressing the due limits."
"Certainly, all of us will proceed in the path followed by Rama. Oh, queen Kaikeyi! What pleasure will be derived through attainment of soverignity, when your relatives, all brahmanas and pious souls desert you forever? Now, you want to do such an act of impropriety"
"I am looking only with surprise, why the earth is not immediately rent asunder,
while you conduct yourself with such an act"
"It is also surprising me why rods of reproaching words fiery and fearful to look at uttered by great brahmana sages are not killing you, who are bent on sending Rama to exile."
"Who will nurture a neem tree, cutting down a mango tree with an axe? And a neem
tree will not turn sweet for him who nourishes it with milk."
"I think, by birth your nature is as exactly as that of your mother. a proverb is
quoted in the world saying that honey does not ooze from a neem tree."
"We know, as heard of in the past, your mother's conduct of evil satisfaction.
Someone capable of giving boons, granted a great boon to your father. By that boon he could identify the language of all created beings. The talk of those beings belonging to sub human species could be known by him."
"From the sound of an ant called Jrimbha near his bed, the meaning of that sound was deciphered by your exceedingly brilliant father and he laughed over it repeatedly."
Your mother, becoming angry over his laugh, wishing even to hand him to death(in
case he refuses to disclose the reason for his laughter), spoke thus: "Oh king, the gentle sir! I ant to know the meaning of your laughter."
"The king replied to that queen as follows: "Oh, royal lady! If I tell you the
reason of my laughter, my death will immediately follow thereafter. There is no doubt about it."
"Your mother then said to your father, the king of Kekayas, Live or die as you will. tell me the laughter. Do not ridicule me."
Having been spoken thus by his beloved consort, the said king of the Kekayas on his part correctly reported the matter to the sage who had bestowed the boon on him. Then the sage who had bestowed the boon replied to the king as follows: "Oh, lord of the earth! Let her die or ruin. Do not reveal the reason to her."
"Having heard the words of that sage who was pure-minded, the king repudiated your mother and lived happily like Kubera the Lord of riches."
"Oh, Kaikeyi, seeing evil everywhere! You, too, thus following the path trodden by wicked men, are making this bad resolution by ignorance."
"The popular saying that males are born confirming to their fathers and females to their mothers, occurs to me as true."
Do not conform to the traits of your mother. Understand that which is said by the
king. following the desire of your husband, be a protectress to these people here."
"Incitedby the evil minded, do not put before the public an improper course of
conduct of your husband who spendour is equal to that of king Devendra and who is a protector of this world.
"Oh, Kaikeyi! Dasaratha the faultless man, the majesty, the lotus-eyed man and the king cannot indeed belie the promise given to you(Hence, you alone has to change your opinion)"
"Let Rama the eldest(of the sons) who is generous strong skilled, capable of
protecting his own duty as Kshatriya but also of protecting the world of living beings, be installed on the throne of Ayodhya"
"Oh, Kaikeyi! A great accusation will surely roam about you in the world, if Rama
leaving his royal father goes to the forest.
"Let Rama of that character protect this kingdom! Be you free from distress. There is none other than Rama living in your excellent city who is competent to rule this Ayodhya"
"In the event of Rama being installe din the office of the prince Regent, King
Dasaratha wielder of the great bow will surely have recourse to the forest, cherishly recollecting the conduct of his forebears"
Thus, Sumantra repeatedly with joint palms, caused a shaking to Kaikeyi in the royal assmebly, by his kind words as well as bitter words.
That queen Kaikeyi, however, was neither excited nor repented in her heart nor was any change observed in the colour of her face.Then, Kausalya, trembling again and again, as though possessed by a spirit, and
lying on the floor without proper disposition of mind, spoke to Sumantra as follows: "Wherever Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana are there, take me to them. Without them, I do not cherish to live here even for a moment."
"Turn back the chariot quickly. Take also myself to the forest of Dandaka. Now, if I do not go after them, I shall enter the Death's abode."
Sumantra with joined palms and with a voice choked with tears and in faint accents, consoling Kausalya, spoke these words to her.
"Abandon grief, delusion and haste born of affliction. Rama, can reside in the
forest, warding off anguish."
"Lakshmana too, knowing about a righteous conduct, having subdued his senses and
serving the feet of Rama in the forest, is propitiating the other world."
"Seetha, getting a dwelling place resembling a house even in a lonely forest, her
mind encamped in Rama and being fearless, is acquiring confidence.
"Not even very minute depression, even a little, is seen developed in Seetha. It
appears to me as though Seetha is accustomed to so many exiles."
"Seetha is taking delight in the desolate forests in the same manner as she was
earlier enjoying in visiting gardens in the city."
"Seetha, a charming woman with her face resembling a full moon and with her mind
absorbed in Rama, even though staying in a lonely forest, is enjoying it like a little girl."
"Seetha's heart is directed towards Rama. Her life also is dependent on him. Even if Ayodhya is without Rama, then it becomes a forest to her."
"As if only a couple of miles away from Ayodhya and as being in a garden there,
Seetha on seeing villages, towns, movement of rivers, and various types of trees, enquires with Rama or Lakshmana and Knows well about them."
"I am remembering only these incidents about Seetha. It does not flash to my mind
now of the words hurriedly spoken of by Seetha about Kaikeyi."
Expunging the remarks spoken by Seetha about Kaikeyi coming almost nearer to his
lips by inadvertence, Sumantra spoke only delightful and sweet words to Kausalya.
"Seetha's radiance resembling a moon's gleam is not fading away due to her travel in the forest or due to the velocity of wind or because of her bewilderment or due to heat of the sun."
"That face of altruistic Seetha resembling a lotus flower, whose lustre is similar to that of a full moon, did not become changed."
"Her feet, which even though no longer painted with vermilion, still looks red as
Alakta (red juice obtained from resin of certain trees), with lustre equal to that of red lotus buds."
"Seetha, sporting her tinkling anklets, walks playfully. Even now, Seetha dons her ornaments, as a mark of Her passion towards Rama."
"Seetha who stays in the forest, takes refuge in the arms of Rama and hence does not give Herself to fear, even by seeing an elephant or a lion or a tiger."
"There is no need to pity them nor us nor the king too. This story will thrive in
the world forever."
"Abandoning grief, possessing cheerful minds, settling well in the path followed by great sages, delighting in the forest-life and eating fruits of the forest, they are keeping up the promise given to their father."
Even if averted thus by Sumantra, who is speaking appropriately well, being
emaciated by sorrow for her son, could not stop crying, "O, my dear son Rama!"Sumitra, who was devoted to righteousness spoke the following words, which were
virtuous, to the celebrated Kausalya, the foremost among women, who had been wailing as aforesaid "That son of yours, oh the venerable one, is endowed with excellent virtues and is the foremost among men. What is the use in your lamenting in this way or in weeping piteously?"
"Oh, noble lady! Your son is having mighty strength. He proved his high- soled
father perfectly truthful by renouncing his throne. He stood firmly in righteousness, which is always practiced perfectly by disciples and which gives fruits even after death. That Rama, the most excellent man, never deserves to be lamented."
"Lakshmana, the faultless man and the compassionate man towards all beings, always renders the best form of service to Rama. His conduct is beneficial to the high-soled Rama."
Sita, who was habituated to comforts, even after knowing the pain whatsoever, is
accompanying your virtuous- soled son."
"What has not been secured by your capable son, who is rich in virtue and is
engrossed in the vow of truthfulness, and the banner of whose fame flutters though out the world?"
"Having known the purity and magnanimity of Rama , the sun assuredly will not be
able to torment Rama's body with his rays."
"Auspicious and delightful breeze of moderate heat and cold, blowing from woods at all times , will render service to Rama"
"Gently touching with its cool rays when he is reposing at night and embracing him like a father, the moon will refresh Rama"
"Formerly, when Rama killed Subahu the son of Sambarasura the chief of demons,
Brahma being delighted , gave celestial weapons to Rama, the man with great splendor. Rama the hero and the tiger among men, relying on the strength of his own arms, will dwell fearlessly in the forest as if in his own palace"
"How can earth cannot be under the command of Rama, to whose aim of arrows, the
enemies fall an easy prey?"
"The splendor endowed with Rama, the valor that is in him and the beneficent
strength that resides in him lead one to believe that when he completes the term of his exile in the forest, he will speedily regain his kingdom."
"Oh, Kausalya! Rama is the illuminator of even the sun, fire of fire, the ruler of rules, the splendor of splendor, the foremost glory of glory, the forbearance of forbearance, the god of gods and the foremost being of all the beings. Indeed, what handicaps are there for him in the forest or in Ayodhya?"
"Rama the best among men will be installed on the throne soon along with the Mother Earth (the consort of lord Vishnu), Sita the princess of Videha kingdom and Lakshmi ( the goddess of fortune another consort of Vishnu)"
"Seeing Rama departing, all the people in Ayodhya smitten as they were with upsurge of grief shed tears born of agony. The goddess of fortune as Sita followed the invincible hero even as he departed for the forest, clad in a garment of the sacred Kusa grass. Indeed, what can be difficult for him to obtain?"
"What can be difficult to obtain for, to whose front indeed walks Lakshmana himself the best among the holders of bow wielding arrows, sword and missiles?"
"Oh, Kausalya! I tell you the truth : you can see Rama coming back, on having
completed the term of his exile in the forest . Abandon grief and infatuation."
"Oh, auspicious Kausalya, the irreproachable one! You will be able to see your son, like the rising moon, saluting respectfully your feet, by bowing his head."
"Seeing Rama shining with great splendor appearing before you again, having been
coroneted, you will be shedding soon tears of joy from your eyes "
"Oh, Kausalya! Do not have uneasiness or grief. Rama has no ill luck. You will be
able to see soon your son along with Sita, accompanied by Lakshmana".
"Oh, the faultless queen! While people are to be consoled by you at this moment, why are you fostering grief in your heart?"
"Oh,queen! You, whose son is Rama, ought not to grieve, for none is established in right path in the world than Rama."
"Seeing your son saluting with his friends, you will at once begin to shed tears,
like a line of clouds in a rainy season"
"Your son the bestower of boons, will soon return to Ayodhya, and touch your feet
with his gentle but muscular hands "
"When your son the hero along with his friends salute you respectfully in adoration, you will sprinkle tears of joy in the same way as a line of clouds pour rain on the mountain."
Sumitra the queen, skilled in her employment of words, who is faultless and
charming, thus consoled Rama's mother with various words and finally stopped speaking. 
Hearing those words of Sumitra the mother of Lakshmana, the agony of Kausalya Rama's mother and the wife of Dasaratha quickly disappeared in the same way as an autumnal cloud with a little water in it disappears quickly.On observing Shuurpanakha who is speaking bitter words against him in the presence of ministers then 
Ravana is highly infuriated and queried her. 
"Who is Rama? How brave he is? Of what mien and what calibre he is? And for what reason he entered the 
highly inscrutable Dandaka forest? 
"What is the weapon of that Rama by whom these many demons are killed in war, likewise Duushana and 
Trishira are killed, and even the unkillable Khara is killed? Oh, lady with fascinating limbs, who disfigured 
you? That you tell. 
When the king of demons has asked her thus, she that demoness Shuurpanakha who is in a fit of fury then 
commenced to describe Rama in the point of fact. 
"Dasharatha's son Rama is the one with inescapable arms and keen-eyed, but has jute-cloths and skin 
of black-deer for his dress, yet in semblance he is similar to the Love-god. 
"Yanking out a bow with golden fillets, and that is similar to the bow of Indra in its shine, he strews 
candent iron-arrows that simulate snakes with deadly poison. 
"It has become imperceivable for me to me to see when and how he drew his ghastly arrows from quiver 
on the battleground; or, stretching his bow admitting those arrows on bowstring - no; or, his releasing 
those sharp edged arrows from the bow - no; why them, that great mighty Rama himself has become imperceptible 
in the fastness of his action. 
"As with a crop of grain devastated by a hailstorm of Indra, I could only see that best army while it 
is being annihilated with a downpour of arrows. 
"Thus a lone foot-soldier with his excruciating arrows has exterminated fourteen thousand demons with 
fiendish might, including Duushana, and along withKhara, say, within one and half hours. 
"Accorded is the protection to the sages, and Dandaka is made as a snuggest place for them. I am the 
lone one somehow let off by such a high-minded Rama, of course, on humiliating me by cutting my nose 
and ears. Maybe, it is because he is hesitant of woman-slaughter for he is a well-versed soul. 
"A highly resplendent one who by his trait matches his brother in bravery, an adherent and a devotee 
of his brother, such a stout-hearted one is Rama's brother known as Lakshmana. 
"That Lakshmana is an easily irritable one, he is not that easily invincible, an easy victor, but not 
an easygoing valiant, yet he is an intellectual at ease, and a mighty one who does not ease off, such 
a Lakshmana is the perpetual right-hand and the peripherally moving life of Rama. 
"But, one with her broad-eyes, face similar to the full-moon is the dear and wedded wife of Rama, and 
she always takes delight in the well-being of her dear one, namely Rama. 
"She is the one with lengthy hairdo, her nose and thighs are fine, and that glorious one with fine looks 
is the wife of Rama, and she is beaming forth like a sylvan deity situated in that woodland, who in 
turn is like Goddess Lakshmi in a temporal form. 
"She has a complexion mathing the shade of refined gold, her nails are rosy and jutting, and she with 
her curvaceous hips and slim waist is the daughter of King of Videha, and known as Seetha. 
"So far I have not seen any goddess with such a comeliness; a gandharva female - no; a yaksha female 
- no; a kinnara female - no; and a woman, no, not on the face of earth! 
"To whom Seetha becomes a wife and around whom she gladly throws her arms after such a marriage, he 
lives more grandly than Indra in all the worlds. 
"She is a highly gracious lady, laudable by her bodily structure, incomparable by her appearance, and 
she will become a seemly wife of yours, and you too will become a best husband of hers. 
"Oh, mighty shouldered brother, but when I ventured to bring her as your wife, whose hips are broad, 
bosom fat and bulgy, face excellent, that cruel Lakshmana disfigured me. 
"You too will become a groveller at the arrows Lover-god in case you now see Vaidehi with a face shining 
like full-moon. 
"Hence, if you hatch an opinion to make her as your wife, and if you aspire success, now itself quickly 
put your best foot, namely your right foot, forward. 
"Oh, the king of demons Ravana, if this advise of mine is pleasing to you, let this idea be actualised 
without any shilly-shallying in your mind. 
"Oh, king of the demons, realise your stout-heartedness, and oh, great mighty one, let that immaculately 
limbed Seetha be abducted to become your wife. 
"On recognising that Rama with his straight shooting arrows destroyed the night-walkers positioned at 
Janasthaana, and further on distinguishing that Duushana, and even Khara, is dispatched, it is apt of 
you to awake to a workable action." Thus Shuurpanakha has earbashed Ravana. On seeing Shuurpanakha who came back only to wreck havoc on demonic race and again fell before him as 
before, Khara spoke this sentence to her in clear terms in all his fury. 
"What for your are howling again when I have just now commanded those fearless flesh eating demons in 
order to fulfill your wish? 
"Those demons are my admirers, adherers and they always remained my well-wishers, hence there is no 
question of their non-accomplishment of my orders. 
"Owing to what you are highly bawling by saying, 'haa, lord' and wriggle on the ground like a snake? 
I would like to know the reason for all this, what is it? 
"I am here to take care of you, then why should you really cry out like an uncared-for being, get up...get 
up, and ward off this sort of perplexity." Thus Khara said to Shuurpanakha. 
She that Shuurpanakha who is otherwise an unassuageable one is wholly pacified when Khara spoke to her 
thus that way, and she on dabbing her tearful eyes then spoke to her brother Khara. 
"I came to you just a while back with my ears and nose chopped off and wet with gushes of blood, and 
you too have comforted me, isn't it. 
"Oh, valiant brother, for my delight you too have sent fourteen demons to eliminate that atrocious Rama 
along with Lakshmana, isn't it? 
"But they all who handled their spears and bolts along with an envious anger are killed in a fight with 
Rama by his arrows that cleave the crucial parts of his opponents. 
"On seeing those highly impetuous demons falling to earth in a trice, and even on seeing the unusual 
deed of Rama in felling them, I am highly alarmed. 
"Oh me! I am alarmed, fully frenzied, and even despaired, oh, nightwalker Khara, and beholding dread 
everywhere again I have come seeking your refuge. 
"Why do not you rescue me when I am drowned in a vast ocean called grief, wherein each pervasive crocodile 
is despair and each swelling wave is fright. 
"Besides, those flesh-eating demons that have followed me are also felled by Rama with his sharp arrows, 
for whom I have a contrite heart. 
"If you have mercy on me, and even on those dead demons, and if ability and animation are still left 
in you to cope with Rama, oh, nightwalker, kill that Rama who is a thorn in the side of demons dwelling 
in Dandaka forest. 
"If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, I will give up my life unhesitatingly, 
that too in your fore, that too now itself.
If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, now itself I will give up my life 
than living a shameless life with these lopped ears and nose. 
"I can perceive instinctually that you are incapable of affronting Rama in a given crucial battle, even 
if your are with all your forces on the battlefield, and you assert yourself a valiant, but you are 
just vainglorious. 
"Kill those two, Rama and Lakshmana, as they are just humans, or else, if you are incapable of doing 
so, really what for is your stay here in Janasthaana with your trivial stamina and trifling sinews like 
a stupid blemishing his clan, then get out of this Janasthaana at once along with your hench-demons. 

"You will completely and quickly evanish, indeed, subjugated by resplendence of Rama, for that Dasharatha's 
son Rama possess that kind of resplendence, in effect. 
"And, by whom I am misshapen that brother of Rama too is a highly vigorous one..." in this way on saying 
Shuurpanakha bawled variously in the presence of her brother, Khara, and then anguished by her own affliction 
that demoness with a cave like belly started hitting her paunch with both of her hands, and what is 
more, she swooned. On taking bath Rama with Seetha and Soumitri, then went to his own hermitage from that bank of River 
Godavari. 
Nearing that hermitage Raghava along with Lakshmana performed early morning rituals and then reached 
the cottage. 
There Rama comfortably spent time while being adored by eminent sages when he is with them, and narrating 
many a narrative while sitting in hermitage along with Seetha and his brother Lakshmana, thus he shone 
forth like the moon when with Chitra constellation. 
At one time when Rama is sitting in hermitage and heartily absorbed in telling narratives some demoness 
arrived at that place, fortuitously. 
She is but the sister of ten-faced demon Ravana, Shuurpanakha by her name and she has seen him on reaching 
the paradisiacal being like Rama. 
He whose face is radiant, arms lengthy, eyes large like lotus petals, stride like that of an elephant, 
wearing bunches of hair-tufts, delicate yet greatly vigorous, possessor of all kingly aspects, complexion 
deep-blue like blue lotus, similar to Love-god in brilliance and in simile to Indra, the demoness has 
seen such a Rama and became lovesick. 
She that demoness who is facially unpleasant one with that pleasant faced one, pot bellied one with 
the slim-waisted one, wry-eyed one with the broad-eyed one, coppery-haired one with the neatly tressed 
one, ugly featured one with the charming featured one, brassy voiced one with the gentle voiced one, 
deplorably oldish one with the youngish one, crooked talker with the pleasant talker, ill-mannered one 
with the well-mannered one, uncouth one with couth, abominable one with amiable Rama spoke, besieged 
by Love-god. 
"You are an ascetic yet with a wife, handling bow and arrows yet in the appearance of a sage  what for 
you have come to this province frequented by demons  it will be apt of you to tell the purpose of your 
coming here, in actuality " 
Thus asked by demoness Shuurpanakha that enemy-scorcher Rama started to inform all about it, straightforwardly. 

"A king named Dasharatha was there with his godlike valour, I am his eldest son, and people hear of 
me by name Rama. 
"He is Lakshmana by his name, my younger brother and a devoted follower of mine, and she is my wife, 
daughter of Videha's king, well-known as Seetha. 
"Desiring to implement the probity in following father's orders and for the sake of establishing probity 
in living an ascetic's life I have come here to forests to dwell, as enjoined by the directives of the 
king and my father, and by my mother, as well. 
"I too wish to know about you. Whose wife are you? What is your name? Or, whose daughter are you? By 
the way, you are with a most enthralling personality, and then you must be a demoness. 
"What for you have come, either, you tell in actuality..." Thus Rama asked her. On hearing the words 
of Rama she that demoness wetted with love said these words. 
"I will tell you truth, Rama, nothing but truth, I am a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpanakha, 
and I will be freely moving in this forest in a solitary manner and unnerving all. 
"My brother is valorous and mighty Ravana, the king of demons and the son of Vishravasa, if ever you 
have heard of him. 
"And the mighty Kumbhakarna who will always be in profound sleep is my brother, and the virtue-souled 
Vibheeshana too is my brother, but he does not behave like a demon, and two more bothers of mine are 
Khara and Duushana who are renowned for their bravery in war. [--b, 
"I can excel all of them by my bravery, oh, Rama, and on seeing you for the first time I had a notion 
that you being the choicest among men you alone are my husband, hence I neared you. 
"I am endowed with such preponderances and I can operate with my independent might, as such you become 
my everlasting husband  by the way, what can you bring off with Seetha. 
"Unlovely and unshapely is this one, such as she is, this Seetha is unworthy to be your wife, and I 
am the lone one worthy to be your wife, hence treat me as your wife. 
"Shall I eat up this disfigured, dishonest, diabolical human female with a hallow stomach along with 
him, that brother of yours to make you free.
"Afterwards, you can lustily ramble about Dandaka forest along with me while enjoying yourself on various 
mountaintops in the sky and in forests on the earth." So Shuurpanakha said to Rama. 
When he is said that way Rama chuckled and that wordsmith started to reply her who eyes are besotted 
in lovesickness with this sentence. On seeing her who fell before him in a misshapen and blood-soaked condition, demon Khara is all stewed 
up and asked her. 
"Rise up, first tell me clearly putting away your flurry and fluster, who disfigured your form in this 
way. 
"Who for sport is poking his fingertip at a venomously fanged black-cobra that has chanced in his close 
proximity but slouching down inoffensively. 
"Who on harrowing you is now heedless about his gulping a deadly poison, or about his foolish bracing 
the noose of Time around his own neck. 
"You are gifted with boldness and braveness, a whimsical rover, a guise changer by your wish, a coequal 
of Terminator, but to whom you have gone and by whom you are led into this kind of plight. 
"Who is that kind of highly intrepid warper, either from gods, or from celestials or from high-souled 
sages who indeed rendered you shapeless. 
"Indeed, I do not find anyone who causes displeasure to me in this world, even among divinities including 
the thousand eyed Indra, the controller of demon Paaka. 
"Now, I will take away the lives of that miscreant with my arrows that are terminators of lives, as 
a swan would drink milk to dregs even if it is mingled in water, duly separating milk from water. 
"Whose frothy blood is it that the earth wishes to quaff when I cut off his crucial organs by my arrows 
and drop him dead in a combat. 
"Whose body is it from which birds pressing round gladly wish to wring flesh to pieces for eating when 
I slay him in war. 
"Now, when I haul him easily on the ground in a battle that villain will be unredeemable either by gods, 
celestials, evil spirits, or by demons. 
"It will be apt of you to gather your sensitivity slowly and tell me as to which miscreant attacked 
and worsted you in the forest." Thus Khara spoke to Shuurpanakha. 
On hearing this kind of words of her brother, especially who is rancorous, then Shuurpanakha spoke these 
words, tearfully. 
"Those two are in adulthood, good-looking, gentle yet greatly mighty, eyes broad like lotuses, dressed 
in jute-cloths and deerskin, subsistent on fruits and tubers, composed, sagacious and celibate, and 
they are the sons of Dasharatha, namely Rama and Lakshmana.

some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts withraamaH kamala patra akshaH

dR^iSTaHSo Shuurpanakha who is also in a sleep like daze, she came out with her soulful feelings 
about Rama.
This narration has threefold meaning. ] Through the eyes of a lustful female; ] To belittle Rama and 
Lakshmana's prowess only to extol Kara's pride; ] To deride Khara's valour so that he gets incited 
to fight Rama and Lakshmana.
taruNau'came of age.'kanyaam varayate ruupamWomen's first criterion towards a man 
is age. But this wording is indwivacana'in duel number' so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. 
Then the question comes 'is she leaning towards both of them?' Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she 
approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach 
Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as peranyonya sadR^ishau viirau'those darers 
are similar to one another.' Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers 
they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that 'this 
situation occurred due to both of them' as at --. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, 
with 'either-or-single-or-both' syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with 
their glorious aspects, so far by her.
ruupa sampannau'their aspects are ravishing' The syndrome is thatangaat angaat sambhavasi'offshoots derive parent's aspects.' So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. 
Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is withniratishaya 
ruupa samR^iddhi'sublime features, endowed with' that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha.

god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident 
on earth before eyes as per the attribute ofkandarpa iva muurtimaan'he has a form like that 
of Love-god'
Then her bother Khara may ask 'then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?' 
For that she saysmahaa balau'greatly vigorous.' They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, 
which is what required by an aged demoness.
puNDariika vishaala akshau'white-lotus, broad, eyed' 'Their eyes are not like ours while our 
eyes aresamrakta nayanaa ghoraa'bloodshot eyes of terrible look'
Or, unliketamo guNa udreka'ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature' and unlikerajo guNodreka'ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature' -- their eyes aresattva guNa sampanna'serene with the pure constituent of nature' Though Rama says that heaatmaanaam maanuSyam manye'in my soul I consider I am human' but as pershruti/ scripture,yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii'though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being,

If it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked 'where are the flowery arrows of that 
Love-god to these two?' But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The 
lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation 
in Lanka says that 'gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal 
eyed one'dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam

and the aspect of Rama on his first sight at Rama aspadma patra vishaala aksham diirgha baahum 
arindamam
Should Khara ask in fear 'who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like 
me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.' Then Shuurpanakha's reply is like this, in 
order to remove Khara's fear of Rama:
taruNau'youngsters, boys' for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these areuuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaamiin Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way 
tells Khara 'brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, ' Furtheryauvane viSayaisiNaam'boys in young age bother more for enjoymentï -- they are bothered to 
enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them'
ruupa sampannau'just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you'kanyaa kaamayet ruupam'girls cherish charming ones' 'They fall after girls only with their 
charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them'
sukumaarau'delicate or fragile, or flimsy,' because they are sons of some king, grown up in 
palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us 
who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...'
mahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau'very, without, strength; very weak fellows';
furthermoremahaa abalau;

Then Khara may ask, "it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up 
some army and fight me back then what?'
For this she says,ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau'wearers 
of jute-cloths and deerskin' And furthering her argument she says, 'how can they afford an army for 
they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is 
begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile.  They themselves 
are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.'
Further, this god, say this 
Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, 
begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him.
Her words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara 
this way in order to enhance his self-pride.

For this she says,sukumaarau'they

Next if it be asked 'are they ready for a fight' for which she says 'they are already clad inciira

are armoured in shield like deerskin. Further they also have arrows and knives with which I am scarred

demon still sitting here as I go on narrating the incident like a story'
"Having all the aspects 
of kings they equal the kings of gandharva celestials, and I am ill-disposed to differentiate whether 
they two are gods or demons. 
" I have seen a curvaceous 
lady between those two, a ripely beauty, rich in comeliness, adorned with lots of ornaments. 
"Owing to that woman I am 
led into this sort of situation, together by those two, as with an insecure female. 
"Staying in the van of war 
I wish to drink the frothy blood of that guileful Seetha along with that of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, 
when they are killed in war. 
"I shall drink her blood 
and also that of those two in war, this being my prime longing let it be fulfilled by you." Thus wailed 
Shuurpanakha before her brother Khara. 
While she is saying like 
that Khara vengefully summoned fourteen great mighty demons that are similar to the Terminator. 
"Wielding weapons and wearing 
jute-cloths and deerskin two humans have got into ghastly forest of Dandaka along with a woman of age." 
Thus Khara is ordering the fourteen demons. 
"You shall return to me only on killing those two and also that 
treacherous woman, and their blood this sister of mine will drink. 
"Oh, demons, on going there swiftly stamp them out by you own 
vigour, thus let the fanciful hearty desire of my sister be achieved. 
"On seeing your finishing those two brothers flatly in a war she 
this sister of mine will be gladdened, and then she drinks their blood in war, amusingly. 
In this way when Khara ordered those fourteen demons, they have 
gone to Panchavati along with Shuurpanakha like black-clouds glided by gales. 
But then, though the nightwalker wielding sharp arrows have become 
ineffectual to trounce Rama like the wild elephants which will become ineffectual to overcome the blazingly 
uprising wildfire. 
Maheshvara Tiirtha notes 
that God Shiva cursed Khara and pardoned saying that he will be released from curse by Rama of Dasharatha.tasmaadyaH 
kruura ruupeNa dehena harataa amR^itam | viShNur daasharathir bhuutvaa mokShayiShyati suvrata |In thesheSa dharmaof Maha Bharata in the discourse between Bhiishma and Yudhistira it is 
said that sage Yajnavalkya has three sons. They are Chandrakanta, Mahaamedha and Vijaya. These three 
Brahmans became Khara, Duushana, and Trishira by the curse of Shiva. The first one Chandrakanta is Khara. 
And the disciples of the three Brahman scholars are fourteen and they also became Brahma-demons, who 
are now being sent. On listening Shuurpanakha Khara came to know that Vishnu arrived in the form of 
Rama and thus Khara wanted to get release from the curse by Rama, and hence firstly he sends the fourteen 
demon-disciples, and later he and his brother also follow the suit.
Tara with her visage that shines like the Lord of Stars, namely the Moon, then spoke to the son of Queen Sumitra, 
namely, Lakshmana, who while he is speaking is as though blazing with his resplendence. 
"Let not this king of monkeys be addressed in this way, oh, Lakshmana, and he is not warranted to listen to such 
tongue-lashing, especially from your tongue. 
"Sugreeva is not an unthankful one, oh, brave Lakshmana, a treacherous one - no; a flagitious one - no; an utterer 
of untruth - no; a duplicitous one, no, this king of monkeys is not even that. 
"Although he is a monkey this Sugreeva has not dismissed from his mind even the favour Rama has done in his respect, 
oh, valiant Lakshmana, which in combat is impractical for others. 
"By the beneficence of Rama, oh, the enemy-scorcher Lakshmana, now Sugreeva is privileged with reputation, everlasting 
kingship of monkeys, more so with Ruma and me as well. 
"Hitherto he has tolerated high anguish and on the attainment of this high comfort of kingship he has not oriented 
himself to the time-oriented actions as with saint Vishvamitra. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, that great-sage Vishvamitra clinging together with Ghritaachi, an angelic apsara, for a period 
of ten years, forsooth that virtue-souled sage regarded that period as one day. 
"When he who is the best one among the time-knowers, that great-resplendent Sage Vishvamitra himself is not privy 
to the occasioned time for a good many years, why talk about a commoner again? 
"He who is overwrought and now undergoing natural bodily appetites, oh, Lakshmana, and who is overtired as he 
is discontent in the concupiscence, such as Sugreeva is, it will be apt of Rama to bear with him for 
a while. 
"Without knowing realities, oh, young man Lakshmana, it will be extraneous of you to hastily enter into the control 
of your rancor like a commoner. 
"Men of your kind having conscientiousness, oh, best one among men, do not hurriedly rush in and get clutched 
by their rancor, unconscionably. 
"I beg for your grace, oh, virtue-knower, in the interest of Sugreeva with all my equability, and you may dispel 
this clangor is upshot in high dudgeon of yours. 
"In the honor of Rama, Sugreeva will disown his wife Ruma, even me, even Angada, why us, he will disown the whole 
kingdom with its riches, food grains, livestock, and whatnot, as I can infer. 
"On eliminating that worst demon Ravana, Sugreeva can bring Seetha together with Raghava, as with the coalescing 
of star Rohini with the Moon. 
"It is said that the demons in Lanka are a trillion, plus thirty-six thousand units of military, where one 
the unit consists of ten ten-thousand warriors, and hundreds and thousands of other demons are there, thus they say. 

"Without eliminating those unassailable and guise-changing demons, it is impracticable to eliminate him who has 
abducted Maithili, namely Ravana. 
"Oh, Lakshmana, it is impossible to kill those demons, or that Ravana, the evil-doer and abductor of Seetha, without 
any assistance, more so to Sugreeva... 
"This way Vali was saying and that king of monkeys is well-informed in these aspects, isn't it! But how Ravana 
mustered up these many troops is unclear to me, and I am saying what I heard from Vali. 
"Intending that assistance to you in war, best monkeys are hastened in all directions, to muster up very many 
best of the best monkeys. 
"Determined to achieve the objective of Raghava this king of monkeys Sugreeva has not bestirred himself while 
awaiting the return of those venturesome and very great mighty monkey warriors who are sent out. 
"According to the well-organized groundwork earlier made by Sugreeva, oh, Saumitri, all of that great-mighty 
monkeys have to arrive here today itself. 
"Only today millions and millions of bears and hundredfold millions of baboons, and innumerable monkeys who by 
their flare are like firebrands will arrive in your fore, oh, Lakshmana, thereby, oh, the enemy-repressor, 
therefore rebut your rage. 
"On staring at this angry face of yours, and on gazing at the angrily bloodshot eyes of yours, unsecured is the 
peace to the females of Monkeys chief, and with the fear caused at first by Vali's elimination we are all indeed 
premonished about such a happening in respect of Sugreeva too. A word about this chapter. The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical 
editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional 
versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four 
verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is 
overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in 
all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter, 
it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmaakuutam, Govindaraja, and others 
have commentaries on the chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses 
uttered by Tara, which is included here also.
On seeing Tara who quickly deluged in a speedy and vast ocean of intolerable anguish, then that Vali's 
mighty brother Sugreeva regretted the killing of his matchless brother. 
While that kind-hearted Sugreeva observed Tara for a moment he despaired at heart, tears filled his 
face, and lamenting very much he slowly paced to the near Rama, surrounded by his attendants. On approaching him who is majestic, and is still handling his bow and snake-like arrow, a distinguished 
person with all of his limbs adorned with great attributes that an emperor should have by birth, to 
such a Raghava who is standing nearby, Sugreeva spoke this way. 
"As promised, oh, best king, you have accomplished this deed with its eventual fruition of getting back 
the kingdom and my wife, but now, oh, prince, my heart is backsliding from the extravagances of the kingdom 
and kingship, as my life itself is rendered despicable, for I got my brother killed.
"When the king is killed, this empress is wailing bitterly, much wailing is there in a city scorched in 
sadness and Angada too is in a doubtful state of sustaining his life in the fond of his father, as 
such oh, Rama, my heart is not taking delight in the kingdom. 
"In the first instance, I have agreed to the elimination of my brother owing to my anger, intolerance 
and as I was subjected to too much ignominy, but now, oh, best one from Ikshvaku-s, when the chief of 
monkeys Vali is put to death, I am painfully remorseful."I think it would be better for me to live on the best mountain Rishyamuka ever in an as-is where 
is condition, somehow spending life befitting to a monkey, and achieving even heaven on killing my brother 
is of no good. 
"The words which he used to speak to me saying, 'I do not wish to kill you, begone...' are befitting 
to that great-souled and rational vanara, and my words in asking you to him to kill him, and my deeds 
in getting him killed is befitting to me, as an irrational vanara. 
"Indeed, oh, brave Rama, whether killing one's brother will be self-torturous? Or, taking pleasure 
in the kingdom on killing that brother will be more? Or, the distress ensuing that killing will be the most? 
Without truly discriminating these cruces, even if one has one's avarice in prospect, who is 
he that is going to take pleasure in killing his own highly honored brother? Excepting me! "Killing me is not in the intent of Vali violating his probity, but my intent has become evilly life 
taking, violating my probity. "I was whining for a time when Vali thrashed me with a tree branch, as if with a schoolmaster's cane, 
but later on comforting me he said this to me, 'Do not do this again, this daring me to fight you back.' 

"Fraternity, dignity, and also probity are conserved by him, while I exhibited furiousness, enviousness, and also naughtiness of a monkey. 
"As Indra acquired sin on killing Vishvarupa, the son of Tvastha, I too derived a sin by killing my 
brother, which sin is unimaginable for quantification, totally undesirable at any given time, 
wholly discardable by sagacious souls, and a disgustingly horrible specter of brotherly hate. 
"Earth, waters, trees, and women took the burden of Indra's sins, but who in name will bear the burden 
of this sin of mine, that too the sin of a monkey, who wishes to share? 
"On undertaking this sort of deed that includes unjust and involves ruination of one's race, I am 
unsuited for this sort of accolade from the subjects of this kingdom, and when I am ineligible to be 
the price regent of this kingdom, wherefore to become its regent? "In this world, I am a committer of a felony which is debased, highly damnable, and pernicious to the 
the world itself, whereupon this irresistible misery is rushing in on me, as with the rush of speeding rainy waters 
towards a declivity. 
"The sin of mine in killing my brother assumed the form of an elephant, where my sinister motives of killing 
my brother has assumed that the elephant's hind and tail, and my causing agony to my brother has 
become that elephant's head, eyes, trunk, and tusks, with them that berserk and a monstrous elephant called 
sin is goring me as it would gore a riverbed. "How difficult is this insufferable sacrilege of mine, oh, best king, owing to which my good breeding 
is shed from my heart, as with the gold, which is alloyed will be intolerant of that filth, but oh, 
Raghava, even the gold sheds itself from scum when melted, and though I melt in grief this scum of sacrilege 
is unshed. 
"I think this body of great-might monkey commanders is withstanding its lives in a halfway, oh, Raghava, 
just because of me and this Angada who is searing in anguish, for it is half-dead with the death of 
Vali. 
"It is easy to get an easygoing and easy-to-deal-with son, but where to get a son similar to Angada, 
oh, valiant Rama, also where to get even such a place wherein there will be an easy access to the nearness 
to one's brother?
It is somehow easy to get a son who is easygoing, and easy to deal with like Angada in this world, but, 
oh, valiant Rama, where is the world wherein I can get Vali-like brother and wherein can be in his vicinity? 

"This best of brave ones, Angada, will not live reft of his father, but his mother Tara has to live 
to foster her son Angada, if Angada dies heartbroken for his father, then without her 
son her misery will become miserable, and then she too may not live... this is my resolve. 
"Such as I am, I wish to enter a highly blazing fire seeking amity with my departed brother and as well 
with son Angada, and these best valiant monkeys will search for Seetha duly conducting themselves under 
your control. 
"Oh, prince, even if I am dead your mission will be achieved in its entirety, and oh, Rama, having perpetrated 
an infraction I have become an eliminator of the propriety of our race, hence I have become an unworthy 
one to live, and hence permit me to commit myself to fire..." Thus Sugreeva said to Rama. [4-24-23]
On hearing the anguished words of the younger brother of Vali, namely Sugreeva, the eyes of Rama, the 
best valiant one from Raghu's dynasty and the eliminator of valiant enemies, are moistened and he became 
perturbed for a moment. At that moment, Rama whose perseverance is like that of the earth and who is the protector of the earth 
saw Tara, who was wailing and repeatedly looking around as she was deluged in desperation, and then 
with all his concernedness Rama paced towards her. The prominent monkey ministers then started to raise her, whose eyes were pleasant and intellect unfailing, 
and who had the lion among monkeys as her husband, but now collapsed on the ground hugging her departed 
husband. 
She who is hugging her husband wriggles highly when she is disengaged from him, and at a particular 
stage, she sees Rama with his bow and arrow in his hands and who is resplendent like the sun, by his resplendence. 

On seeing at him whose eyes are graceful, one endowed with all kingly attributes, who looked best among 
men, and who is unseen so far, that fawn-eyed Tara realized him alone as that Rama. 
She on whom misfortune has changed and who is anguished, that noble lady Tara went very quickly with 
highly squirming movements to the near of the highly exalted soul Rama, who matches Indra in his valor 
and an unreachable one for his enemies. 
Their body language of Tara which is so far disconcerted by the grief felt for Rama's perfect hitting, 
feeling, and achieving his object in war, namely, Vali is now disoriented to anger on seeing the very 
same Rama, as she is a self-respectful lady. But on arriving at the near of that very pure being Rama, 
that ireful body language of hers again reoriented itself to a sort of serenity, and then she spoke 
this to him. 
"You are an indeterminable one, an inaccessible one, one with his self conquered, the supreme among 
righteous souls, your glory is unmitigated, and you are the one with clear discrimination and endurance 
earth-like, and your eyes are blood-streaked like those of an emperor. 
"You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling 
bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of a magnificent human body.
"You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling 
bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of a magnificent human body. 
"Oh, brave one, kill me too with the same arrow with which you have killed my dear husband, and on getting 
killed at your hand I wish to reach his near, as Vali takes no delight without me. 
"Though Vali with eyes like unblemished lotus petals reaches heaven he looks around for me, and not 
finding me there, he does not have a romance with celestial apsara-s though they will be in amazing 
costumes and wear red-colored towering tiaras. 
"Even though Vali is in heaven he will derive despair and despondency without me, like you, who are 
despondent and despaired on the pleasant stretches of mountainsides of that best mountain Rishyamuka, 
as you are without Seetha. 
"How a virile person derives discomfort without his woman, that much you know, isn't it! Because you 
are aware of it, you kill me; let not Vali get any discomfort when he does not find me. 
"Oh, prince, as a high souled one even if you think that, "sin of killing a female will not befall on 
me?" But deem me as his soul, as scriptures say that the wife is the soul of husband, and hence kill 
me, then there will not be any blemish of woman killing. 
"In the course of implementing scriptural rituals, and even as contained in various Vedic sayings, wife 
is not a separate entity from her husband, and no better endowment than endowing a wife to an eligible 
bridegroom by bride's father is countenanced by the wise men in the world, isn't it? 
"Even you, oh, valiant one, on examining good and bad bestow me to my dear husband, and by that way, 
oh, brave one, by such an endowment of a wife to her husband, by way of killing and sending her to her 
husband, you too will not get any touch of sin. 
"Anguished and unprotected, such as I am, oh, king, I am being distracted from my departed husband by 
these Vanara misters, and it is unapt of you not to kill me, as I am incapable of living without him, 
whose sprightly gait is like that of an elephant, a best one among fly-jumping Vanara-s, a courageous 
one, and who wears a precious and exquisite golden pendant..." Thus Tara pleaded with Rama for a mercy death. 

Thus that way when Tara spoke to that lord and great-souled Rama, Rama consoling Tara well, spoke this 
word of expediency, "Oh, wife of valiant one, let not your mind go raving, the Creator decreed all the 
world to be in this way isn't so! 
"And the same Creator has ordained mirth and misery , and even their association, so say sagely people. 
And even the triad of worlds is indeed under his control, and that triad too, cannot transgress the 
foreordained predestination. 
"You will get paramount appeasement as before, and your son will become the crown prince, God has ordained 
destiny only in that way. Wives of the valiant ones will not mourn emotionally." Thus Rama consoled 
Tara. 
Thus consoled by that persuasive, noble-souled, and enemy-burner Rama, that brave one's wife whose aspect 
is fair and whose attire is proper, she paused her plaint, but with a puling expression. Then the illiberal Vali has heard that outcry of his plain-spoken brother
Sugreeva from his palace chambers. 
On hearing Sugreeva's outcry that is shuddering all beings Vali's insolence is
diminished as high furore superimposed on it. 
Then, embitterment overspreading on all his limbs Vali with a golden hue is
immediately rendered non-luminous like the eclipsed sun.
With asymmetrical teeth and burning fireball-like eyes, Vali is reflective of a
a lake whose red lotuses are uprooted leaving stalks afloat. 
That monkey Vali then on hearing that intolerable noise bolted out of the palace
chambers thumping his feet as though to shatter the earth.
His wife Tara stepped in and showing goodwill and amity hugged him, for she was in
fear and bewilderment, and said this word that is beneficial in its futurity if Vali heeds it.

"Oh brave one, you better gently leave off this anger that is coming on like a
gushing river as is done with an enjoyed chaplet on getting up from bed in the early hours.

"Oh, monkey, you can fight with him in the early hours of tomorrow, oh, brave one,
you neither have divers enemies nor your valour is trivialised."
"You can fight with him at appropriate time, thereby your enemy is neither glorified
nor you are trivialised evidently, for you are a braving one. 
"Your quick exiting is disagreeable for me, and what for you are dissuaded that may
be listened as I tell. 
"Earlier Sugreeva came assaulting and inviting you for combat, and you also have
gone out and rendered him as a nonentity, and being battered by you he fled in all directions.

"He who is undone earlier by you, particularly after torturing you, is coming
here again and inviting you for a duel is causing doubt in me. 
"The arrogance and endeavour of the shouter, and even the rampage of his furore, all
these will not have a trivial reason, won't it? 
"I do not think that Sugreeva has come here unaccompanied, and on whom he is
dependant must be an unflinching support foregathered by Sugreeva. 
"By his nature, Sugreeva is an expert and even so a clever one, and he does not enter
into friendship with anyone without examining his mettle. 
"I am already briefed by our son Angada's information, and what I have heard I will
now relate that helpful word to you. 
"Son Angada said this account when he returned from forests, and to him, spies are
said to have reported this.
"Those that are born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, sons of the king of Ayodhya, valiant and
unconquerable ones in war, called Rama and Lakshmana are there in this country. These two
unassailable ones have chanced there at Sugreeva's place to fulfil the longing desire of Sugreeva.

"He is an acclaimed one for his warfare, and like the fire flaring up at the end of
the era he shatters the strength of enemies, and he is Rama your brother's helpmate, they say so.

"And he is said to the habitable tree for the polite, the ultimate course for the
woebegone, a hospice for the agonised, and grace Rama is the only abode. 
"He is endowed with the knowledge of mundane and ultra-mundane things, he always
abides in the directives of his father, and as with Mt. Himalayas for all-natural elements, he is
the greatest mine of merits. 
"By that reason, with that unconquerable one in conflicts, an imponderable one and a
great-soul Rama, your enmity is inapposite. 
"Oh dauntless one, I tell you this much that you shall not become overcritical of
him, and what I say is beneficial to you that may now be listened to and even implemented."Oh, king, let Sugreeva be decorously and quickly anointed as prince regent, and oh,
resolute one, let there be no hostility to your own younger brother. 
"Achieving unanimity with Sugreeva and solidarity with Rama by discarding enmity, in
the effect is appropriate for you, thus I deem. 
"This Sugreeva is your younger brother and you should be keen about him, isn't it...
and whether he is here or there in Rishyamuka he is just your brother. 
"Indeed, I do not see anyone on earth a coequal to him in kindred spirit, hence
leave off this enmity and honour him with bestowals and felicitations as an insider, and retain him
at your side. 
"That boisterously voiced Sugreeva is indisputably an excellent kinsman of yours,
and hence brace yourself with the fondness of brotherhood, as there is no other way out to you.

"If you look upon me to do my favoured deed, and if you look upon me as an expedient
one, I beg of you in our loving attachment that my gentle word of advice is done. 
"Be graceful and it behove you to listen to my small but expedient talk, and
following up rancour alone is unbecoming of you, thereby your confrontation with the Prince of
Kosala will be unpardonable for his dynamism equals that of Indra." Thus Tara spoke to her husband
Vali. 
Then, though Tara spoke beneficial and advisable words they were unimpressive to Vali
for he is impounded by fatality and driven by time to his doom. That great vanara king Vali who is sprawling agonized by an arrow, and to whom Rama gave a reply with well-reasoned 
words did not find any other reply to be given to Rama. 
He who is heavily thrashed with trees, whose limbs are variously cracked with boulders, and whom Rama's 
arrow finally vanquished, Vali fainted at the time of his breathing his last.
Tara, the wife of Vali, heard that the tiger monkey Vali perished in the fight by the arrow released by Rama.
On hearing the very gruesome killing of her husband that is unpleasant, she is highly anguished and 
rushed out of Kishkindha along with Angada. 
On seeing Rama with bow those very mighty vanara-s that form the escort of Angada are scared to death, 
and they very quickly fled from there towards Kishkindha. 
Then on her way toward the field of combat, she saw the monkeys that were frightened and fleeing in disorder, 
like those animals that wandered off from their herd when their master was killed. 
Nearing those monkeys that are already distressed at the fall of Vali, that are highly frightened 
by Rama, and they are fleeing as though Rama's arrow is still tracking them down, Tara speaks to all 
of them, distressed as she is.
"Oh! Vanara-s, what for you are running away in utter fright and desperation, leaving off your best 
king to whom all of you are ushers?" Thus Tara enquired with the monkeys. 
"Whether or not a cruel brother made his brother fall for the reason of kingdom with the arrows of 
Rama which can surge well from a distance and fall on distant targets? Aver it. 
On hearing the words of the monkey's wife those guise-changing monkeys spoke this sentence coherently to 
Lady Tara, befitting to the present time of chaos. 
"Return, oh, a lady with a living son, and safeguard Angada, for the Terminator in the form of Rama is 
taking away Vali on killing.
"Shattering trees and massive boulders that Vali hurled at him with thunderbolt-like arrows Rama felled 
Vali as if by a thunderbolt. 
"When that tiger fly-jumper Vali whose brilliance is similar to Indra is killed all this vanara force 
felt defenseless and fled. 
"Let the city of Kishkindha be safeguarded and let Angada be anointed, and when Vali's son Angada is 
enthroned all the fly-jumpers will stand by him. "Or, your staying here is not good, oh, one with a pleasant visage, for those monkeys of Sugreeva will 
promptly enter our strongholds on this day itself. 
"There are foresters in Kishkindha, some with wives and some without, some hankering after wives, some 
whom we have victimized, and from them, we have very great danger." So said Monkeys to Tara. 
On going a small distance ahead after listening to those words, she whose smile will be winsome, that lady 
Tara said this befitting to her personality.
"Of what avail is a son, or a kingdom, or I to myself when my husband that lion like a monkey with great 
honor perished. 
"I wish to consign myself at the base of the foot of that great soul, who is felled down by the arrow projected 
by Rama." So said Tara to fleeing monkeys. 
Saying thus she started to wail and convulse in agony and slapped her head and chest with both of her 
hands while she speedily rushed towards Vali. 
While she is still trudging then she sees her husband who is the destroyer of arch-demons like Maayaavi 
and Dundubhi, and who never retreated in combats, but has now fallen on the ground. 
She saw Vali who is a flinger of the loftiest mountains with Indra flinging his thunderbolt, who is a 
blaster as with great gusty winds, and who is a roarer as with a cluster of great black clouds. 
He who equals Indra in the invasion of enemies, a violent thunderer at the opponent thunderers, a brave 
one felled by still brave one, and who is like the best animal killed by a tiger for the flesh, 
and quietened like a black cloud at the end of a downpour, At him she saw. 
He who is like a sanctum that is hitherto worshipped by all people, that is decorated with flags and 
demarcated with podia, but just ravaged by an eagle for the sake of a snake that sneaked into that 
sanctum and Tara saw such a Vali plumped on the ground. 
She saw Rama standing and abutting on his very powerful bow, and his younger brother Lakshmana, even 
the younger brother of her husband, namely Sugreeva. 
Going past them she reached her husband who was routed in combat, and on observing him closely she indeed 
fell on earth as she was distraught and dumbfounded. On getting up as though reawakened from sleep she saw her husband bound fast by the strings of death, 
and then she wailingly addressed him as, "Oh, nobleman's son..."
On observing her who is wailing like a female osprey, and even on looking at Angada who arrived there, 
a miserable remorse came upon Sugreeva. Then that renowned Tara closely whiffed that face of monkey's king Vali and spoke these words to her 
dead husband. 
"Heedless of my word, oh, brave one, you are reposing miserably on a very rough and uneven ground spread 
with stones. "This earth must be your beloved one, oh, best of monkeys, why because, you still embrace 
her while you recline on her, without replying to me. 
"You have gone into the control of Sugreeva and Sugreeva alone triumphed, oh, brave one, oh, enthusiast 
in adventures, oho, is it fated to happen this way. 
"These chiefs of bears and monkeys are adoring you in every respect as their most worshipful one, and 
on hearing their despairing wailing, the lamentation of Angada, and even these utterances of mine 
in keen, why do not you come back to your senses? 
"Do you wish to repose on the very daybed on which you have laid your enemies to rest when you have 
once felled them in fights, or what? 
"Oh, the successor of a clan with pristine caliber, oh, according of dignity, oh, a devotee of fighting, oh, 
my dear, have you gone on leaving me without a protector and lonely? 
"Considerate fathers shall never propose brides to adventurers, they say. Yes! See me the wife 
of an adventurer, in a trice rendered as a war widow left in the lurch. 
"My honor is degenerated and my eternal happiness is disintegrated, and I am deluged in an abyssal 
the boundless ocean called anguish. 
"And dense with metallic substance is this heart of mine in its solidity, since it is not splintering 
into hundredfold even on seeing my husband killed, it is definite. 
"By your nature, you are my beloved, besides, you are a good-hearted one, more so, you are my husband, 
moreover, you are valiant triumphing over your enemies in assaults, such as you are you have attained 
the fifth state, the death. 
"Perhaps a woman might have mothered many children, and perhaps affluent with riches and crops, still 
people will call her a widow if she is without a husband. 
"How do you repose now on a sheet of blood flowing from your own body, oh, brave one, as if you are 
reclining on your bedspread with a bed sheet of red blood color? 
"I have no strength to closely embrace you with both my arms, oh, best fly-jumper, when the blood and 
dust covering your body comes in between. 
"Single arrow released by Rama has doubly benefited Sugreeva in this highly deplorable enmity between 
you and Sugreeva, as his ambition to become the king is fulfilled and his fear of your persecution, 
too, is evanished. 
"In vain, I have been watching you without a wink, on whom fatality has descended, as this arrow stuck 
in your chest is hindering me from embracing you..." Thus wailed Tara. 
"Then the monkey chief Nila extricated that arrow which is stuck in the chest of Vali, as with the extraction 
of a firmly wedged sparkling snake from the cavity of a mound. 
The sparkle of Rama's arrow, while it is being extracted from Vali's chest, is much the same as the sparkles 
of more brilliant sunrays that are extracted by the end of daytime, when the sun is sinking beyond the 
summit of a dusky western mountain, and as contrasted with the hue of dusk. The blood streams flown out of the gashes of Vali fell everywhere like streams of water flowing 
from a mountain saturated with coppery mineral ores. 
On wiping off war dust with which her husband is muffled up, with tears gushing from her eyes she drenched 
that valiant one who is summarily hit by the missile of Rama. On giving attention to all of the blood-wet limbs of her slain husband lady Tara spoke to her son 
Angada whose eyes are coppery-red. 
"See the highly harrowing end-time plight of your father, oh, son, he reached his end owing to the enmity 
harnessed by sinful deeds. "To him, whose physical splendor vied with the dazzle of the rising sun, to that father, king, and the 
accorder of honor you pay you last obeisance as he journeyed to the abode of Time-god." Thus Tara said 
to Angada. 
When he said so, Angada swiftly rose and touched the feet of his father with both of his rotund-shouldered 
sinewy arms saying, "Father, I am Angada..." "Why do not you bless Angada saying, 'long live, son...' when he is paying respects to you, as earlier?" 
Thus Tara is addressing Vali in her anguish. 
"I am living through seeing the lifeless state of yours with the help of my son, no more than a helpless 
cow that sits near her bull with its calf, when that bull is slain by a lion, just now. 
"How can you singly take the ultimate bath of a Vedic ritual after you conduct a ritual like combat, 
in the waters called bloodstreams caused by Rama's arrow, that too, when I, your wife, am available like 
a co-officiator of a Vedic ritual? 
"Now where is that treasured golden pendant of yours that the king of gods gave to you when he was satisfied 
with your conduct in wars, I don't see it. 
"Majesty is not deserting you even if your lives have departed, oh, according to dignity, as with the 
sunshine that departs the sun while he circumnavigates Mt. Meru, which mount is supposed to overshadow 
everything by its vastness. 
"Neither you heeded my word of expediency, nor I was indeed capable of forestalling you, and I am doomed 
along with my son when you are exterminated in the fight, whereby the Grace that forsook you, is deserting 
me too, in its entirety.On seeing her husband fall to the ground with a terminator-like arrow released by
Rama, that resentful lady Tara whose face is lovely like the moon, reached and embraced him.

Tara is agonised when she sees the elephantine and mountainous vanara, namely Vali,
reduced to no more than an uprooted tree, and she wailed fretfully with grief scorching heart.

"Oh, stern one in fights, oh, victorious one, oh, best valiant, oh, best flier, I
have never blamed you either in your presence or your absence, why don't you talk to me now?

"Arise, oh, tiger monkey, you have to make use of the best bed as the best kings will
not on repose on soil in this way, isn't it? 
"The earth seems to be a highly cherished darling of yours, oh, lord of the land, as
you still embrace her with your limbs leaving me off, even when your lives are drained.

"It is evident that you, who conduct yourself righteously, must have built a
Kishkindha-like delightful city in the pathway to heaven by your leaving lovely Kishkindha.

"You bring an end to the pleasure trips you made along with us in the sweet-smelling
forests from time to time by your departing. 
"When this fifth state betiding you, oh, great chief of chiefs of monkeys, I am
dejected, despaired, and drowned in the sea of sadness. 
"My heart is very sturdy - perhaps, even on seeing you slain and fallen to the ground,
it is not splintering now into a thousand splints, though it is tormented by sorrow. "By which reason you have snatched away Sugreeva's wife, oh, chief of fliers, and
even expelled him from Kishkindha, that is the reason why you got this result. 
"I am she who said a beneficial word to you with an interest in your well-being and
wishing for your welfare, but oh, best monkey, you unmindfully brushed me off. "Oh, endower of honor, apsara-s, the celestial dancers, will be proud of their
beauty, youthfulness, and expertise in romance, and oh, honorable one, you can stir up their
hearts towards you by your gallantry, definite is that. 
"The Time which is an undoubted factor in respect of anybody has ended your life,
definite is that, and that Time alone perforce brought you, who is otherwise an uncontrollable
force, to the control of Sugreeva.
The Death / Time no doubt has a concern with anyone for it is the ender of life, and
definitely, it chanced upon you by the capability of Sugreeva in getting the support of Rama, and
Sugreeva alone controlled you, who is otherwise an uncontrollable force. "Rama's killing Vali when he is fighting with another is unbefitting in its method,
and he too is not at all worried about doing such a highly deplorable deed. 
"So far I am not doleful or saddened, but now as a desolate seethed by sorrow I have
to undergo widowhood and dolefulness. "My Angada is raised fondly, a brave one with gracefulness and one who is accustomed
to comforts, but which will be the predicament he has to undergo when his paternal uncle Sugreeva
gets into a fit of fury. 
"Oh, son Angada, clearly see your father, a patron of virtue, oh, boy, later it is
impossible to catch a glimpse of him." Thus Tara said to her son Angada. 
"You have started towards the other world, isn't it, so reassure your son, kiss goodbye
on his forehead, and give me your parting messages." So said Tara to Vali. "Rama has not only done a great deed of hitting you down, but he also
achieved indebtedness towards Sugreeva, both in a single promise. 
"Now, you are to your heart's content Sugreeva as you regain your wife Ruma, you may
even wallow in the kingdom unworriedly as your enemy-brother is silenced." So said Tara to
Sugreeva.
"Oh, lord of monkeys, why do not you talk to me, the dear wife of yours, when I am
prattling at length, by the way, several of your comely wives are here, they are here, see them."
Thus Tara lamented. On listening to Tara's lamentation the vanara females that are around became plaintive,
saddened pitiably, and wept piteously embracing Angada. "Oh, one with bracelets on your mighty arms, why you are going to an eternal abode
leaving your dear son Angada? Your going away leaving such a son, who possesses the best aptitudes that
come close to your abilities, and the one who always wears an exquisitely pleasant getup, is
unbefitting. 
"If I have done any undesirable deed indiscriminately, even in the least, I
maybe pardoned for that, and here I bow down at your feet... oh, masterful one... oh, the lord of
Monkey lineage... oh, brave one... [Thus Tara wept for Vali.] That Tara with her unblemished complexion is seated near her
husband along with other vanara females, and weeping pitiably in that way, she decides to
self-immolate, and thus she flounces down onto the ground where Vali is slouching.Seeing Mahodara and Mahaparshva the demons having been killed, and that valiant and
mighty Virupaksha struck down in that great battle, a tremendous anger took possession of Ravana.
He urged on his charioteer and addressed to him the following words:
"Killing those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, I will remove surely the sorrow
caused to me on account of the ministers who have been killed and the city which has been laid
siege to (by the monkeys)."
"In the battle, I will cut down the tree in the shape of Rama, which is going to
yield fruit through its flower in the form of Seetha, whose principal branches are Sugreeva,
Jambavan, Kumuda, Nala, Dvivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana, Hanuma, Sushena and all the chiefs
of monkey-warriors."
Ravana, the mighty and the surpassing Chariot-Warrior, went quickly, making a noise
in all the ten directions, with the sound of the chariot, rushing towards Rama.
Filled with that sound, the entire earth, with its rivers, mountains and forests,
trembled, throwing lions, antelopes and birds, into fright.
He employed very highly terrific and exceedingly frightful mystic missile called
Tamasa, which began to consume all the monkeys, who started falling down on all sides.
Dust began to fly up from the earth, while those frustrated monkeys were fleeing
away for they could no longer bear that missile built by Brahma himself.
Seeing those hundreds of many of his armies shattered by excellent arrows of Ravana,
Rama took his stand, ready for the battle.
Having driven away the army of monkeys, Ravana the foremost among the demons then
saw Rama, the annihilator of his enemies, who was endowed with long arms and eyes as wide as lotus
petals standing unconquered with his brother Lakshmana-like Indra the lord of celestials is seen
with Vishnu, the supreme lord of preservation-holding up his great bow as though scraping the
sky.
Seeing the disappointed monkeys and Ravana advancing, the mighty Rama who was
endowed with a great splendour and accompanied by Lakshmana who were born in Raghu dynasty, then
pleasingly seized his bow at the middle.
Thereupon, Rama began to stretch his excellent bow, which was endowed with great
force and sonorous, as though he was breaking the earth asunder.
Then, due to that buzzing sound produced by the streams of Ravana's arrows as also
by the twang of Rama's bow, those demons fell down in their hundreds.
That Ravana, coming within the range of arrow-shots of Rama and Lakshmana, resembled
Rahu (the demon who is supposed to seize the sun and the moon), standing in the vicinity of the
moon and the sun.
Wishing to fight him with his sharp arrows at the earliest, Lakshmana stretching his
bow, released his arrows which were like flames of fire.
Ravana of extra ordinary energy prevented those arrows, the moment they were
released by Lakshmana, with his arrows, in the sky itself.
Showing the dexterity of his hand, Ravana split the arrows of Lakshmana one with
one, three with three and ten with ten arrows.
Overpassing Lakshmana, Ravana the victorious in battle, approached Rama, who stood
like another mountain, in the battle-field.
Having approached Rama, Ravana the lord of demons, having his eyes turning red-blood
through anger, released streams of arrows upon him.
Just on seeing streams of arrows coming forth, loosed from Ravana's bow, Rama
thereupon quickly seized hold of 'Bhalla'* arrows in haste.
Then, Rama tore off that multitude of arrows, which were blazing and looking very
terrific like enraged serpents, with his sharp Bhalla - arrows.
Rama on Ravana and Ravana on Rama, quickly showered each other with streams of
sharp-pointed arrows of various kinds.
Pushing back each other with the velocity of their arrows and remaining undefeated,
the two warriors described circles of different kinds each moving from left to right, for a long
time.
Created beings were frightened, even as both the terrific warriors were fighting all
at once, releasing their arrows at each other, thus resembling the god of retribution and the god
of Death respectively.
The sky at that time became dense with arrows of various kinds, even as it is
covered, at the end of the monsoon, with clouds crowded with crowns of lightning.
The sky was studded as with eye-holes, by showers of arrows of high velocity, which
were extremely sharp-pointed and adorned with plumes of vultures and were loosed with high
speed.
They initially made the sky dark with arrows. Even after the sun-set, they made it
dark, like two huge clouds risen in it.
A great combat ensued between both of them, who were willing to kill each other.
That battle was unimaginable and unapproachable, like the duel that took place between Vritra the
demon and Indra the lord of celestials.
Both the warriors were excellent archers. Both were skilled in war-fare. Both were
eminently skilled in the use of missiles. Both moved unhindered in the battle-field.
In whichever course both of them went, in the same respective direction, streams of
arrows went, like waves in two oceans, whipped by the wind.
Ravana, having skilful hands and a cause for the cry of the world, released a row of
steel arrows on Rama's forehead.
Rama endured on his head, that row of steel arrows, having a lustre of black
lotus-petals, discharged from the terrific bow. He did not get perturbed.
Thereupon, seizing hold of more arrows, reciting sacred incantations and making use
of the missile presided over by Rudra and stretching his bow, the valiant Rama of great splendour
was filled with anger and released those arrows.
Fallen on the unbreakable armour of Ravana, which looked like a large cloud, those
arrows could not cause any pain to him at that time.
Rama, who was skilled in the use of all types of mystic missiles, forthwith pierced
in the forehead, yet again by a paramount missile, that Ravana seated in his chariot.
Having pierced the frames of arrows of Ravana, Rama's arrows penetrated like
five-headed hissing serpents into the earth, when rebuffed by Ravana.
Striking down Rama's missile, that Ravana, who was stupefied with anger, employed
another exceedingly terrific missile presided over by demoniac forces.
He released sharp arrows, having the heads of lions and tigers, those of buzzards
and crows, even of vultures and faloons, as well as those of jackals and wolves, arrows with their
mouths wide open, having the heads of venomous snakes with five heads, bringing fear.
Hissing like a serpent provoked to anger Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary
energy and conjuring tricks, released towards Rama these and other arrows, having the heads of
donkeys, those of boars, dogs and cocks as also of alligators and venomous snakes.
Possessed by a missile presided over by demoniac forces, that Rama endowed with a
great strength and resembling the god of fire, released a missile presided over by the god of
fire.
Rama employed there, various kinds of arrows, with heads bright as fire, others with
heads shining like the sun, the moon, the crescent, a comet, others shining like planets, lunar
mansions and a huge meteor and some arrows resembling flashes of lightning.
Struck by Rama's missile, the terrific arrows of Ravana got destroyed in the sky and
fell down in thousands of pieces.
Rejoiced to see that missile struck down by Rama, who was unweary in action, all the
valiant monkeys, who were capable of changing their form at will, then encompassing Rama, raised a
clamour, facing Sugreeva.
Striking down with force that missile which came forth from Ravana's arms, the
great-souled Rama, then was filled with rejoice while the chiefs of monkeys, full f joy, shouted
loudly.Then, Sugreeva of great majesty, the king of monkeys spoke (the following)
meaningful words to Hanuma, in order to inform him what they should do next.
"Since Kumbhakarna and his four sons were killed, Ravana cannot give any defense
now".
"Let those dexterous monkeys, possessing the strength of lions, taking torches in
their hands, rush towards Lanka quickly, in order to set ablaze the abode of Ravana."
Then at the sunset of that awful evening, those foremost of the monkeys, went
towards Lanka, with torches in their hands.
When the troops of monkeys, with torches in their hands, attacked Lanka on all
sides, the diversely eyed demons who were holding the position of guards, suddenly fled away.
Those monkeys, feeling gladdened, threw fire to the towering gates, attics, streets,
various byways and mansions.
Then, the fire consumed thousands of houses of demons. Mansions of mountainous forms
fell down on the ground.
Aloe, excellent sandalwood of great value, pearls, glossy gems, diamonds and corals
were burnt there.
Linen, charming silk, blankets of sheep's wool, various kinds of ram's wool, gold
ornaments and weapons were burnt there.
The ornaments, saddles etc. of diverse and peculiar designs of horses, the chains
worn round the neck of the elephants as also their girths and polished ornaments meant for the
chariots were also burnt.
Coats of mail of the warriors, the armour of the elephants and horses, swords, bows,
bow-strings, arrows, lances, goads and javelins were burnt there.
The fire raging on all sides burnt blankets and rugs made of the hair of animals,
whisks made of the hair of the tails, the skins of tigers, many birds, palaces inlaid with pearls
and gems and various kinds of stores of arms.
Then, the fire burnt away many kinds of bright coloured houses of all demons, who
were greedily desirous of their homes. The fire there burnt away hundreds and thousands of
inhabitants of Lanka, who were protected by gold coloured armoury and decked with garlands,
ornaments and garments, with quivering eyes due to inebriation, moving with lustful walking, who
were seized with fury against their enemy, who carried maces, pikes and swords in their hands, who
were eating and drinking too or lay fast asleep on splendid beds with their loved ones and who were
decamping quickly to all sides, taking their sons with them, frightened and fearing up again and
again.
The fire there burnt away the houses, which were strong, very valuable, with
profound qualities, decked in gold with moon shapes and crescent shapes, which rose high with their
top rooms, provided all round with beautiful windows, furnished with seats coaches etc., decorated
with gems and corals, as though touching the sky, rendered noisy with notes of herons, peacocks,
veena the Indian lute and the jingling of ornaments as also appearing like mountains.
Surrounded by fire, the arch-ways shone like a collection of clouds bound by
lightning, at the end of a summer season.
The houses, surrounded by fire shone like the peaks of a large mountain, ignited by
a forest-fire.
Getting scorched in fire, beautiful women, while lying fast asleep in their
seven-storeyed mansions, gave up all connection with their ornaments and screamed loudly, saying
"ah! Alas!"
The houses too, surrounded by fire there, fell down like peaks of a great mountain,
struck by the thunder-bolt of Indra.
Those houses, while being burnt, shone, from afar, like the peaks of Himalayas being
consumed by fire on all sides.
That City of Lanka at night with its house-tops being burnt ablaze with flames,
looked like Kimshuka trees in full bloom.
With their elephants let loose by the superintendents of the elephants and horses
too set free, Lanka was like an ocean, with roaming alligators in it at the end of a
world-cycle.
Here, seeing a horse being let loose, an elephant went back frightened. There,
seeing a frightened elephant, a horse turned back with an alarm.
While Lanka was being burnt, the great ocean, with its image reflected on its
waters, assumed like a great sea with red waters.
That City burnt by the monkeys, within a short time, became transformed like the
earth burning at the time of terrific dissolution of this world.
The noise of the women-folk, who were burnt by fire and covered with smoke, roaring
loudly, was heard upto one hundred Yojanas (or eight hundred miles).
Then the monkeys, eager to fight, bounced suddenly upon the other demons, whose
bodies had been severely burnt and who rushed out (to save their lives).
The loud noise made by the monkeys and the cry of the demons caused resounding of
all the ten quarters, the ocean and the earth.
Healed of their wounds and unperplexed, both those great souled princes, Rama and
Lakshmana seized hold of those two excellent bows.
Thereupon, Rama pulled his excellent bow, making a tumultuous twang, which struck
terror in demons.
Rama, drawing his great bow, was as shining at that time as Lord Shiva (the source
of Universe), stretching his bow, consisting of the Vedas in a great wrath (as at the time of
dissolution of the Universe).
The twang of the bow-string of Rama could be heard above both of those sounds. The
sound of the monkeys and the cry of the demons.
The raised voice of the monkeys, the cry of the demons and even the twang of Rama's
bow-string these three sounds pervaded all the ten quarters.
By the arrows released from Rama's bow, the main gate of that City looking like a
peak of Mount Kailasa, tumbled down, shattered, to the ground.
Thereupon, seeing Rama's arrows descending on seven-storeyed mansions and other
houses, the war-preparedness of the leaders of demons got disturbed.
To those demoniac leaders, who were preparing for the battle and emitting lion's
roars, that night became a night of final dissolution (presided over by Rudra, the lord of
destruction).
The monkey-chiefs were commanded by Sugreeva as follows: "O monkeys! Approaching the
nearest gate, begin to wage the war. Even though present at the scene of fighting, he among you who
proves futile by an escape, should be overtaken and killed as he will be quality of disobeying the
royal command."
Seeing those monkey-chiefs, standing at the gate, with flaming torches in their
hands, Ravana was enraged with fury.
All the ten directions were distracted because of Ravana's act of disorderly
movement of his body due to yawning and he looked like the wrath manifest in the limbs of Rudra
appearing with a form.
The enraged Ravana sent both Kumbha and Nimkumbha, the sons of Kumbhakarna, along
with a multitude of demons.
By the orders of Ravana, Yupaksha, Shonitaksha, Prajangha and Kampana along with the
aforesaid sons of Kumbhakarna set out for the battle.
Ravana instructed all those mighty demons thus, "O demons! Proceed now itself,
bellowing a lion's roar."
Incited by Ravana, the valiant demons then, wielding shining weapons and roaring
repeatedly, sallied forth from Lanka.
By the gleams of ornaments worn by their own natural splendour, those demons and
monkeys with their fires, made the sky fluorescent on all sides.
The effulgence of the moon there, the light of the stars and the splendour of the
ornaments of both the armies, while blazing, made the sky brilliant.
The effulgence of the moon, the splendour of the ornaments and the fluorescence of
the blazing planets made the armies of monkeys and demons glitter on all sides.
With the flames of the half-scorched houses there, the ocean on its part with its
agitated waves mingled with water, shone abundantly.
That army of demons was looking awful with flags and banners, with excellent axes
shaped like swords, consisting of terrific horses, chariots and elephants, crowded with
foot-soldiers of every description, distinguished by shining pikes, maces, swords, spears, lances
and bows, noted for its redoubtable valour and prowess, with shining lances and rendered noisy by
hundreds of tiny bells (tied around chariots, elephants etc), the arms of its warriors adorned with
sets of gold ornaments, their axes being brandished, mighty weapons being waved about, arrows
fitted to the bows and the whole atmosphere rendered fragrant by the abundance of sandal paste,
garlands and wine.
Seeing the army of demons, which came crowded with gallant warriors, thundered like
a huge cloud which was difficult to assail, the army of monkeys marched forth and made a loud
noise.
That large army of demons on its part went springing forward with all speed, towards
the hostile army, as moths towards a flame.
The excellent army of those demons, in which iron clubs and the tips of missiles
being brandished through the action of their arms, shone all the more brightly.
Thereafter, the monkeys desirous to fight there, striking the demons with trees,
rocks and fists, jumped up as though frenzied.
Likewise, the demons with their terrific prowess instantly tore off the heads of
those monkeys bouncing upon them, with sharp arrows.
The demons there strolled in the streets of Lanka, with their ears bitten off with
teeth, their skulls smashed with fists and their limbs broken by crag blows.
Even so, some demons with terrific form struck those chiefs among the monkeys, with
sharp swords, on all sides of the battle field.
One warrior killed the one who was killing another, a second one threw down the one
throwing down another; a third one scolded another who was scolding the other one; while a fourth
one chewed the one chewing another.
There, one said "Give me the blow. Another said, "He is giving". Yet another said,
"I am giving" some talked with one another, saying "Wait. Why do you take pains?"
In that very terrific war between monkeys and demons, some weapons were made futile.
Some weapons were dug into armours. Long lances were lifted up. Fists, pikes, swords and spears
were used as weapons of war.
In the battle-front, the demons killed monkeys in tens and sevens. The monkeys too
threw the demons down in tens and sevens.
Catching hold of the army of demons, whose hair and raiment's were kept in order
with difficulty and whose armours and standards were thrown away, the monkeys surrounded them on
all sides.Then, Rama gently woke up Lakshmana, who was sleeping without break, even when the night was passing away.
"Oh, Lakshmana! Hear the sound of wild animals, resounding beautifully. It is time for our journey. Let us start."
That Lakshmana who was sleeping, being woken up by his brother at the right moment, had relinquished sleep, sloth and strain which resulted on the way.
Thereafter, all of them raised up touched the auspicious water (took bath) in the
river and proceeded towards the path leading to Chitrakuta mountain, as suggested by the sage Bharadwaja.
Rama who set out along with Lakshmana at that dawn, spoke as follows to Seetha whose eyes looked like lotus leaves.
"Oh, Seetha! Behold Kimshuka trees with their diadem of flower blossoming all over, as if they are blazing up, in this winter."
"Look at these Bhallataka (cashew nut) trees, abounding in flowers and bent down
with fruits and leaves, all unplucked by men. We can certainly live here."
"Oh, Lakshmana! Behold in every tree the hanging honey-combs, with sizes of a
water-trough, gathered by honey-bees.
In this beautiful forest-region, dense with a scattered mass of flowers, a Chataka bird is crying and a peacock is responding to it."
"See this Chitrakuta mountain with a high and mighty peak, wide-spread with a
multitude of elephants and made to resound by a congregation of birds."
"Oh, brother! We shall sport in this forest of Chitrakuta, having a level-ground
beautifully extensive with many trees and is pure."
Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha traveling on foot, approached the mountain of Chitrakuta, which was pleasant and lovely.
Reaching that mountain, with various flocks of birds, with many roots and fruits,
lovely and rich in streaming water, Rama said to Lakshmana as follows:
"It is appearing to me that this beautiful Chitrakuta mountain yields an easy
sustenance, for, it is charmingly filled with various kinds of trees and creepers with different kinds of roots and fruits."
"Oh, gentle brother! High souled sages are also staying on this mountain. Let this become the dwelling. Let us have a pleasant resort here."
After deciding thus Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana all with joined palms approached the hermitage and offered salutation to the sage Valmiki.
The great sage Valmiki, who knew what is right, full of delight, treated them with honour, offered cordial welcome and requested them to sit.
Then Rama, the lord with mighty arms, in accord with tradition, reported to the
ascetic all that concerned them and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:
Lakshmana, my gentle brother! Bring strong and choicest timber and construct a
dwelling. My mind is fascinated in dwelling here."
Hearing those words of Rama, Lakshmana brought various kinds of trees. Thereafter, he the annihilator of enemies, constructed a leaf-hut.
Seeing that hut, which was firmly built and thatched as well as beautiful to look
at, Rama spoke the following words to Lakshmana who listened to his command and who was closely attentive to him:
"Oh, Lakshmana! Bring the meat of an antelope. We shall perform a purifactory
ceremony while entering the house. Which is to be done by those who wish to live long."
"Oh, large-eyed Lakshmana! Killing the antelope quickly, bring it here. The
prescribed rite according to scriptural point of view indeed is to be performed. Keep in mind the sacred obligation."
Lakshmana the slayer of enemies, understanding his brother's words, acted as
instructed. Rama spoke again to Lakshmana as follows.
"Oh, gentle brother! Boil this antelope's meat. We shall worship the leaf-hut. This day and this instant also are of a distinctive character. Be quick."
Then, Lakshmana the strong man and son of Sumitra, killing a holy back antelope,
tossed it in an ignited fire.
Feeling certain that it is cooked and heated thoroughly with no blood remaining,
Lakshmana spoke to Rama the lion among man as follows:
"This black antelope, with its complete limbs, has been cooked completely by me. Oh, Rama resembling God! Worship the concerned deity, as you are skilled in that act."
Rama, the virtuous man and the learned man in chanting of sacred spells, after
taking bath and with subdued mind, briefly chanted all the sacred scripts to be chanted at the end of a purifactory ceremony.
Worshipping all classes of deities and getting himself purified, Rama entered the
house. There was a heartful joy in rama, with his limitless splendour.
Having taken bath in the river as prescribed Rama offered oblations to Lord Rudra
and Lord Vishnu after offereing tributes to Vaisvadeva. He performed benedictions relating to the purification of house and also a silent prayer as per prescribed rites. He finally offered excellent tributes to the deities, for removing sins.
Lakshmana erected altars in all the quarters of the hermitage as was fitting,
Chaityas (places for worship of Lord Ganesha and others) and Ayatanas (places for worship of Vishnu and others) Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha, having auspicious characteristics, satisfied the sirits by crowns of flowers obtained in the forest, by fruits roots and cooked meat, by water, by prayers as uttered in the sacred texts (Vedas), by sacred grass, by fuel and Kusa grass and then
entered the auspicious leaf-hut.
All of them (Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana) together for residential purpose, entered that hut, thatched with leaves of trees, looking beautiful, well-constructed at a suitable site and protected from winds, as if entering an assembly-hall called Sudharma (in heavn) by a group of celestials.
Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana who subdued their senses, very happily strolled in that excellent forest, filled with many classes and multitude of beasts and birds, trees having multi-coloured crowns of flowers, and resonating with sounds of elephants in rut and of antelopes.
Delighted and joyful to reach the lovely Chitrakuta mountain and the river
Malyavati, provided with good descents and frequented by birds and beasts, Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana shed the agony caused by their exile from the City of Ayodhya.
That Hanuma with great strength crossed the insurmountable ocean without becoming tired and viewed the city of 
Lanka is located on the peak of Mount Trikuta.
After that, the powerful Hanuma standing there shone like one made of flowers being showered by a rain of flowers 
released by trees.
The glorious Hanuma with the best courage, even though crossing a hundred yojanas, was without a sigh and did 
not obtain any tiredness.
"I can cross many hundreds of yojanas. What to say about the end of the ocean which had been counted to be a hundred 
yojanas long?"
That Hanuma, the best among powerful ones and the foremost also among those who can fly, reached the city of Lanka 
by crossing the great ocean with good speed.
He passed through forests with dark green-hued fragrant lawns and also consisting of great rocks and hills.
Hanuma, the best among Vanaras and the radiant one, tread on mountains covered with trees and on a series of trees 
full of flowers.
That son of God Vayu stood on a mountain and saw forests and gardens and also the city of Lanka situated on the 
top of a mountain.
Standing on that mountain, the elephant among monkeys, Hanuma, saw pine trees, Karnikaras, and date palms in full 
blossom, Priyalas, lemon trees, wild jasmine trees, mogra trees, long pepper trees filled with sweet fragrance, 
Kadamba trees and seven-leaved banana trees, Asana trees, Kovidaras, and Karaviras in full blossom, trees that were 
tied by the weight of their flowers and flower buds, which were distressed by birds, with their crests moved by 
wind, wells, and various glorious pleasure groves filled with various trees that give fruits and flowers in all seasons 
and beautiful gardens also, surrounded by various ponds consisting of swans and ducks.
The glorious Hanuma neared the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and saw the city which looked like the city of Gods 
in heaven, decorated by moats filled with lotuses and water lilies, which were well protected, since the time of 
Seetha's abduction, by Ravana and by Rakshasas with horrifying voices roaming around, which was surrounded by 
a golden boundary wall, that beautiful great city consisted of houses equal in height to mountains and looked 
like autumnal clouds, with white and elevated main streets, decorated with flags and pennons, with excellent golden 
hued archways adorned with sculpted rows of vines.
That best among monkeys Hanuma saw the city of Lanka with beautiful white buildings situated on the top of a mountain 
like a city located in the sky.
Hanuma saw that city of Lanka ruled by Ravana the king of Rakshasas, constructed by Visvakarma (architect of Gods), 
and which looked as though it were floating in the sky.
Hanuma saw the city of Lanka with buttress and enclosure wall as her hip and loins, the vast body of water in 
the moat as her raiment, Satagnis and Sulas as her locks, the mansions as her earrings, constructed by thought. 
He reached the northern gate and thought thus.
Hanuma saw the city of Lanka equal to the peak of Kailasa as though touching the sky, as though flying to reach the 
sky, with its best mansions, filled with horrible rakshasas and serpents like the city of Bhogavati (capital of 
Patala), one which was unfathomable, a well-arranged and clear city governed by Kubera in earlier times, protected 
by courageous, horrible serpents and Rakshasas with mouths with sharp teeth like a cave, with spikes and Pattisas 
(spears) in their hands. Hanuma saw Lanka's great protection and the ocean and Ravana the horrible enemy 
and thought thus.
"Even if Vanaras were to come here they would not meet with success. It is not possible even for Devas to be victorious 
against Lanka in war".
"Even if He reaches this very difficult and impenetrable Lanka ruled by Ravana, what can that Sri Rama with mighty 
arms do"?
"In the matter of overcoming rakshasas, there seems to be no opportunity for persuasion, gifts, dissension or 
even war".
"Only four great Vanaras can come here - the son of Vali (Angada), Nila, myself, and the wise king Sugriva".
"I will first find out if Seetha is alive or not. I will think all this later, after seeing that daughter of Janaka".
After that, that elephant among monkeys Hanuma who was interested in the welfare of Sri Rama, stood on that mountain 
peak and thought for an instant.
"It is not possible for me to enter the city of ogres protected by cruel and strong rakshasas, with this appearance".
"All these mighty ogres with extraordinary energy and great prowess are to be cheated by me while engaged in the 
search of Seetha".
"To achieve this great deed successfully, entering the city of Lanka in a small form at night is a timely thing 
to do".
Hanuma saw such the city of Lanka, which was difficult to overcome even for Devas or asuras, and thought thus 
repeatedly.
"By what idea can I see Seetha the daughter of Janaka, unseen by the wicked Ravana, the king of the ogres?
"How can the task of Sri Rama, one who knows self, not be destroyed? How can I see Seetha alone in a place 
devoid of people?."
"With a mediator who has an unsteady and gloomy mind working against time and place, tasks that are otherwise 
ready to succeed get harmed, like the darkness that gets destroyed at dawn".
"Even a decided mind will not shine when thinking about gain and loss. Mediators who are respected by scholarly 
people will also harm tasks due to their arrogance."
"How will the task at hand be not harmed? How will my mind not get gloomy? How will not the crossing of the ocean 
go waste?."
"If I were to be seen by rakshasas, this task of Sri Rama, with a famed mind, who desires the slaying of Ravana 
will become wasteful."
"It is not possible to be in Lanka even in the form of a rakshasa. What to say about being there in any other 
form?"
"My thought goes thus: Even wind cannot pass here without being known. There is nothing not known to the might 
rakshasas."
"If I stay here with my usual form, I can be destroyed. The task of the Lord will also be harmed."
"For that reason, I will become small in my appearance and will enter Lanka at night for the success of the task 
of Sri Rama."
"Entering the unapproachable city of Lanka at night and searching all the mansion of Ravana, I can see Seetha."
The courageous Hanuma thus thinking and being interested in discovering Seetha, then desired the sun to set.
After the sun had set, Hanuma reduced His body at night to a size equal to that of a cat and became a wonderful 
sight to behold.
The courageous Hanuma quickly flew during the evening time and entered the beautiful city with well-divided main pathways.
Hanuma saw that great city filled with a series of mansions, golden-hued pillars, and window lattices, which was 
equal to the city of Gandharvas, consisting of seven and eight-storied buildings with their top portions studded 
with crystals and pearls and decorated with gold.
There in that city of Lanka, the houses of rakshasas shone with top portions painted by cats-eyes and emeralds 
and decorated by groups of pearls.
Golden archways with strange hues illuminated the well-decorated city of Lanka in all directions.
Hanuma on seeing the unimaginable city of Lanka with a wonderful appearance became sad thinking about the prospect 
of capturing Lanka and also happy being eager to see Seetha.
Hanuma saw that city of Lanka of great fame, with white, closely built buildings having golden windows and doorways 
of great value, consisting of ogres of great strength and ruled by the hands of Ravana.
The shining moon too rose with its many thousands of rays, as though performing help to Hanuma, being in the 
middle of its retinue of stars and covering the earth with a canopy of light. That Hanuma saw the moon rising 
with the glow of a conch shell, shining with a milky white hue of a lotus fiber, like a swan swimming in a lake.
That Hanuma saw the moon, which was rising in the sky with the splendor of a couch shell, shining in white color 
as milk or lotus-fiber, and looking like a swan swimming in a lake.Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jataayu whom Ravana nearly 
killed. 
"Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics 
of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, 
or by cognising calls of birds. 
"Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you, 
even though oh, Kakutstha, these animals and birds are running towards you surely for my sake, to tell 
about me. 
"Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jataayu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering 
Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck." Thus Seetha wailed. 
That best lady who is very highly panicked bawled noisily, "oh, Rama of Kakutstha... oh, Lakshmana... 
liberate me now..." as though the addressees are before her. 
That sovereign of demons, Ravana, rushed towards Vaidehi whose garlands and jewellery are muddled up 
and who is bawling like an orphanized one. 
Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, 'leave it off, leave it 
off...' when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a 
climber plant, and bawling, 'Rama, Rama,' and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched 
her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. 
While Vaidehi is insulted thus, entire world together with its mobile or sessile beings became chaotic, 
and there chanced a blanketing of a blinding blackness, and waft-less is the Wind and shine-less is 
the Sun. 
On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an inappropriate being with His clairvoyant eyes, the illustrious 
Grandparent of Universe Brahma declared, "the deed is done..." but all of the supreme sages in Brahma's 
abode on seeing Seetha in such a condition became despondent, and yet delighted in foreseeing results. 

On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an impropriate being, the dwellers in Dandaka forest cognised that 
Ravana's annihilation has chanced coincidentally. 
Ravana, the lord of demons, on wresting Seetha who is bawling, "Rama... Rama..." also thus as, "Lakshmana..." 
took flight skyward. 
That princess Seetha scintillated like the oblique flashes of lightning in a cloud, owing to her golden 
coloured body which is muffled up with jewellery of pure gold, and added with a golden coloured ocherish 
silky dress, while traversing in the sky. 
When her ochreish silk sari's upper fringe is upheaved by air onto to Ravana, Ravana looked blazing 
like a mountain set ablaze, muchly and overly. 
Reddish and scented lotus-petals adorning that highly auspicious Seetha have slithered, but again upheaved 
by air they are bestrewn on Ravana. 
Upper fringe of Seetha's silk sari with golden glitter is upheaved in the sky, and with the reddish 
hue of sun in red heat of midday it beamed forth like a reddish cloud. 
As with a stalk-less lotus the immaculate visage of Seetha is unbright in the sky when she is on the 
flank of Ravana as Rama is not in vicinage. 
Her lotus pistil like un-pimply face is adorned with a pretty forehead on which prettyish curls are 
fluttering, and with teeth that are spick and span and sparkling, but tears dabbed on that face to sideways 
when she wept, yet it is pleasant like moon for a sight with shapely nose, pretty eyes, roseate lips, 
and shining with golden hue in sky. Nevertheless, when she has gone in the flank of Ravana on the sky 
such an immaculate face of Seetha turned like a palish moon that has just risen bursting a bluish cloud. 

Highly disconcerted by the king of demons that auspicious face of Seetha is unbright like the moon arisen 
in daytime with somewhat golden hue, owing to the absence of Rama. 
She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth 
like a sapphirine gemstone studded in a golden cincture.
She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone 
forth like a golden cincture girded to an elephant. 
Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, with a complexion that is goldenly yellowish in the tinge of a lotus, 
moreover with her ornaments of purified gold, flashed like a lightning possessed in a dark-cloud, when 
that stonehearted Ravana possessed her. 
With the rustles of Vaidehi's jewellery that lord of demons shone forth like a shipshape blue-black 
cloud with rumbles and undulating lightning. 
Flowers gracing her best body on her head, in garlands on chest, and on armlets have fallen all-over 
the surface of earth like showers of flowers while she is being abducted. 
Though that flower-shower has fallen all-over, it is windswept by the speed of Ravana, and fell again 
on that Decahedral demon. 
Like the garland of pristine stars that circles round the loftiest Mt. Meru, that flower-shower circled 
Ravana, the brother of Kubera. 
Slid from the left foot of Vaidehi her anklet adorned with gems fell down onto the plane of earth like 
an electric annulus with its sparky sparkles. 
She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of 
demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, herself becoming a golden girdle girded around the elephant 
like Ravana.
She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of 
demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, as with an elephant, with a golden girdle, stabled in an elephant-stable 
by a mahout, the elephant-trainer. 
Ravana, the brother of Kubera, on invading the sky abducted that radiant Seetha who is radiating the 
sky by her own radiancy like a massive meteor. 
Some of her ornaments which are lustrously flamy, for they are sparkling like the sparkles of fireworks, 
are strewn about on the plane of earth with much clatter like the stars pelted down from the sky. 
A multi-string pearl pendant, a rivi�re, that vies with the moonshine has glissaded from the medial 
of her breasts, and while glissading from sky it is sheeny like River Ganga while she glissaded from 
skies. 
The trees on which diverse birds are perching have been stirred up with the wind blown and up-heaved 
by the gust of Ravana's flight, while the swaying motion of those treetops is as though waving hands 
to console Seetha saying, "fear not... fear not..." 
With wilted lotuses and scared fishes and other beings moving in water the lotus lakes are unenthusiastically 
sorrowing for Maithili as though Seetha is their girlfriend.
The lakes with lotuses as their faces, and fishes as their eyes, and with the other facial adornments 
like the swimming, sweeping and sailing water-moving beings like tortoises, waterfowls and the like 
are unenthused, for a similar girlfriend of theirs, the lotus-faced, fish-eyed, lotus-modelled Seetha 
is beleaguered, and thus they are sorrowing for such a selfsame Maithili. 
All lions, tigers, animals and birds have then gathered in herds from all-over and ran rancorously and 
pursuantly shadowing the shadow of Seetha. 
The mountains appeared bewailing with their waterfalls as shedding tears and with their peaks as upraised 
arms, while Seetha is thus being abducted. 
On seeing Vaidehi who is being abducted thus, magnificent Sun in firmament is saddened, and lowly weakened 
is his sunshine, palely whitened is his sun-disc, and faintly deadened is his solar constant. 
"When Ravana is abducting none other than the wife of Rama, then there is no probity. At such a juncture, 
how conscience can prevail? Unfounded are candour and compassion," thus the throngs of all beings overly 
regretted. 
Verily frightened are the fawns of deer, and their saddened faces are with tear shedding eyes with flustered 
looks, and they looked up and up at Seetha in sky and wept. 
On seeing Seetha who is undergoing anguish in that way the sylvan deities physically shuddered in a 
worst way. 
She who is looking searchingly at the plane of earth for Rama or Lakshmana, and truly bawling in high-pitched 
but mellowly voice calling "Rama, Lakshmana", and whose hair-lengths are tousled, and whose felicitous 
vermilion mark on her forehead is smudged very untidily, that Decahedral demon abducted such an uncompromising 
husband-devout, Vaidehi, only for his self-ruination. 
She who is already detracted from her kinsfolk in Mithila or in Ayodhya, that Maithili with pretty teeth 
and clean-cut smile is then distanced from the only two last kinsmen, for either Raghava or Lakshmana 
or both are unseen by her, and thus her face is paled for she is chastened by the cumber of consternation. 
When Ravana is spoken to by Jataayu with judicious words, Ravana's eyes reddened infuriately, and his 
burnished golden ear-knobs flickered injuriously, and that lord of demons dashed towards the lord of 
birds, intolerantly. 
As with two gigantic clouds up-heaved by the tornadic gusts will be hard hitting each other tempestuously 
in sky, the combat between those two, Ravana and Jataayu, became tempestuous in the sky. 
As with a startling combat between two gigantic and winged mountains, called Mt. Maalyavanta-s, that 
combat between the eagle and demon then became a startling one. 
Then the great-mighty Ravana incessantly stormed the lord of eagles Jataayu, with arrows that have excruciating 
and highly dreadful arrowheads, like tubular arrows, iron arrows, and with arrows that have crescentic 
arrowheads. 
That eagle Jataayu who is the lord of winged-chariots, namely birds, in turn sustained those arrays 
of Ravana's arrows in that combat. 
But that great-mighty Jataayu severally made gashes on the body of Ravana with his two feet that have 
gashing claws for that bird is with best stamina. 
Now the Decahedral demon Ravana infuriately took up ten deadly arrows that are similar in their shine 
to the Shafts of the Terminator, wishful of the elimination of his enemy. 
That highly energetic Ravana released and impaled the eagle with straight shooting arrows on fully stretching 
the bowstring up to his ear, whose steel-pointed arrowheads are sharp, hurtful, and deadly. 
That Jataayu on seeing teary-eyed Jaanaki in the chariot of the demon forcefully lunged towards that 
demon heedless of arrows that are lunging at him. 
That unexcelled bird of high refulgence then shattered Ravana's bow which is decorated with pearls and 
gemstones, and on which an arrow is admitted targeting the eagle, just by the pair of his bare feet. 

Ravana convulsed in anger then took up another bow and stormed hundreds and thousands of arrow storms. 

Nested in the arrows shot by Ravana that lordly bird Jataayu then shone forth in that combat like a 
bird that obtains a readymade nest. 
On winnowing those arrays of arrows with both of his wings, he that highly refulgent Jataayu shattered 
the mighty bow of Ravana with both of his feet. 
That highly resplendent lord of birds also blasted off the armour of Ravana, which is glowing and flamelike 
in its flare, with both of his feet. 
Mighty Jataayu also knocked off the ghost-faced mules yoked to the chariot of Ravana which are covered 
in golden armours and tantivy in fastness. 
Then that great-chariot which is flourishing with three bamboos from chassis to yoke, and which traverses 
just by its steersman's wish, and which is crafted fantastically with gem-studded body and stairs, or, 
whose wheels are crafted with gold and gemstones, and which in its flare is like a Ritual-fire, Jataayu 
splintered down even that chariot of Ravana. 
Jataayu swiftly collapsed the parasol of Ravana which in shine is mirroring the full moon, along with 
the regalia of white-royal-fur-fans, together with the demons handling them for fanning Ravana. 
Again that highly energetic and imposing king of birds pecked off the robust head of the charioteer 
of Ravana with beak. 
Now Ravana who is with his devastated bow, devoid of chariot, dispatched are his horses and departed 
is his charioteer, and such as he is, he on grabbing Vaidehi by her torso, or, placing her on the lower 
end of his torso, jumped to earth. 
On seeing Ravana who is foundered onto earth from his crumbled vehicle, all beings like sylvan deities, 
caarana-s, siddha-s and suchlike, reverenced that lordly eagle Jataayu. 
But on seeing the commandant of birds Jataayu is fatigued owing to his senescence, Ravana is gladdened 
and he again rose up to skies taking Maithili. 
The highly resplendent king of eagles Jataayu swiftly rose to sky dashing practically to forestall Ravana, 
which demon's assault devices are all demolished by now save for a single sword, but who is cheerful 
to spirit away the daughter of Janaka, and actually spiriting away holding her onto his flank, and Jataayu 
spoke this to such Ravana. 
"You mean-minded Ravana, you abduct her whose husband wields arrows that touch off like the Thunderbolt 
of Indra, and this spite of yours is definitely for the destruction of all the demons. 
"As one thirsteth drinketh water, you drinketh venomous drink along with your friends, relatives, ministers, 
armies, and with your accomplices, as this abduction of Seetha itself is squirrelling away dangerous 
poison. 
"As with the mindless adventurers quickly getting ruination for they undertake self-ruinous exploits, 
unknowing the backlashes thereof, so also you too will ruin that quickly with this mindless adventure. 

"You are tethered for termination with the lasso of the Terminator, as with a fish that can go nowhere 
on its biting fishhook with a piece of flesh. How do you untether yourself from that lasso of the Terminator, 
even if you go anywhere? 
"But, oh Ravana, the unassailable Raghava-s of Kakutstha dynasty will nevermore condone your assailing 
this hermitage. 
"Like a dastard you are committing a crime of thieving Seetha when none at home in the footsteps of 
thieves, this thieving is contemptible to society and condemnable by valiant ones. 
"Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right 
away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. 

"A person undertakes such an unrighteous and fateful activity if only death looms large on him. You 
too have undertaken this unrighteous fateful activity only for your self-ruination. 
"If sin is consequential to any given activity who will undertake it? Even if that person vies with 
the Self-Born God and Lord of the Universe, namely Brahma, will he undertake it?" Thus Jataayu advised 
Ravana. 
Even on speaking those commonsensical words to Ravana, Jataayu found him carrying off Seetha heedlessly, 
then that valorous Jataayu descended on the hind-side of that Decahedral demon Ravana, devastatingly. 

On clasping Ravana with incisive claws Jataayu lacerated deeply and rampantly, as a mahout, an elephant-trainer-controller, 
sitting astride on it will try to control an uncontrollable elephant that is running amok with an incisive 
goad. 
Weaponed only with his claws, wings, and beak, Jataayu not only tore the back of Ravana asunder applying 
his beak and claws, but started to tweeze even his hair. 
His lips becoming intolerantly quivery when Ravana is exasperated by that king of eagles repetitiously, 
that demon staggered on to his right targeting the hovering eagle at his hind-side to fell it down. 

Ravana who is aggrieved and convulsed in fury hit back Jataayu with his palm while firmly clutching 
Vaidehi onto his left flank. 
Jataayu, the lord of birds, being a vanquisher of enemies outstripped Ravana and ripped off ten left-arms 
of Ravana with his beak, with which left arms Ravana is clutching Vaidehi, in order to release her from 
his clutches. 
Though his arms are mutilated thus, they instantaneously ricocheted from his body like snakes possessing 
a series of venomous blazes sprawling out from a snake pit. 
The valorous Decahedron Ravana then threw off Seetha, and out of fury he scuffled with the king of eagles 
with fisticuffs and kicks, by both his feet and fists. 
Then there chanced an encounter for some time between those two valorous ones with mutually outweighing 
capabilities, namely the chieftain of demons and the chief of the birds. 
Ravana brandishing his sword at Jataayu, who is revolting for the sake of Rama, hewed off both of his 
wings, sides, and feet. 
When that demon of cruel actions has ruptured his wings that colossal eagle Jataayu immediately fell 
down to earth with a lessened life. 
On seeing Jataayu fallen on earth and dampened with blood Vaidehi fell into a fit of weeping and ran 
towards him as if he is her own relative. 
Ravana, the monarch of Lanka, gazed at that worthily valorous Jataayu, who in his shine is like a blue-black 
cloud with a whitely white chest and who by now is like a quiescent fire-storm flattened onto ground. 

But then Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, whose face vies with moonshine hugged eagle Jataayu, whom Ravana 
has subjugated with his forcefulness and felled down onto the surface of earth, and she wept over incessantly. 
When Ravana whose intention is to abduct her has enquired thus, then on the basis of his Brahman friar's 
mien Seetha informed about herself on her own. 
Thinking briefly that, 'he is a Brahman and an untimely guest, he will indeed curse me if he is not 
replied,' Seetha spoke this sentence. 
"I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife 
and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. 
"On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all 
cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. 
"In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers 
to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. 
"When Raghava's anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her 
husband Dasharatha for a boon. 
"Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought 
two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. 
" 'If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,' 
thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful 
riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. 
"My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years 
are reckoned up from my birth. 
"Rama - thus he is exalted in the world, an unambiguous, unblemished, unsullied one, and a broad-eyed 
ambidextrous one, who delights in bringing universal welfare, is my husband. 
"But Rama's father Dasharatha was lovesick for Kaikeyi and to fulfil her desired aspiration that great 
king did not anoint Rama. 
"When Rama arrived in the presence of his father, Kaikeyi readily and decidedly spoke these words to 
my husband. 
" 'What your father has proclaimed, oh, Raghava, that may be heard from me. He said, 'let this thornless 
kingdom be accorded to Bharata.' 
"And you, oh, Kakutstha Rama, indeed have to inhabit the forests for nine plus five years, hence you 
repair to forests and redeem your father from the remorse of perjury.' 
" 'As an unfearing one from any quarter and as a resolute one in his pledge my husband Rama said 'so 
be it' to Kaikeyi and followed her dictate. 
"My husband is evermore a renderer but not a recipient, and forever he speaks truth, and not the untruth, 
least of all. Oh, Brahman, this is the unalterable and unsurpassable vow of Rama. 
"One known as Lakshmana is such a Rama's brother from another mother, and he is a valorous one, tigerly-man, 
and an eliminator of enemies in war. 
"He who is known as Lakshmana, a follower of virtue and steadfast in his commitment, followed Rama handling 
his bow as a helpmate, when Rama was proceeding to forests along with me. 
"Because Rama always abides in probity and resolutely vowed to it, he entered Dandaka forest in the 
aspect of a tufty haired saint along with me and his brother. 
"Such as we are, oh, eminent Brahman, we three are moving about the impenetrable Dandaka forest just 
by our own mettle as we fell down from kingdom owing to Kaikeyi. 
"Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will 
be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches 
meat, aplenty. 
"Such as you are, oh, Brahman, you may make mention of your name, parentage and caste, in their actuality. 
For what reason you are wandering in Dandaka forest lonesomely?" Thus Seetha questioned Ravana. 
Ravana, the great-mighty king of demons, brusquely replied Seetha, the wife of Rama, while she is still 
speaking in this way. 
"Oh, Seetha, of whom all the worlds composed of gods, demons and humans are highly startled, I am that 
sovereign of hosts of demons, known as Ravana. 
"On seeing you, oh, impeccable one, glittering with golden complexion and attired in ochry-silks, I 
derive no pleasure in my wives. 
"You become my prime queen above all the choicest women with superior status, whom I have appropriated 
from here and there. 
"Nestled on a mountaintop my great city known as Lanka is there in the midst of an ocean and all over 
encompassed by an ocean. 
"Oh, Seetha, there you can saunter in pleasure-gardens along with me, and oh, lady with resentment, 
you will not think back to this forest-living, at all events. 
"Oh, Seetha, if you become my wife five thousand handmaidens adorned with ornaments of every description 
will be in your attendance." Thus Ravana said to Seetha. 
When Ravana said in this way, Seetha the daughter of Janaka, a flawless one by her physique, dishonoured 
and replied that demon. 
"I have avowed to adhere to such a husband Rama, who is inflexible like a sturdy mountain, comparable 
to lordly Indra, unshakable like a vast ocean. 
"He who is enriched with all endowments, and who is like a banyan tree with its surmounted orbicularity, 
the high-minded one with truthfulness alone is his target, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. 

"He who is ambidextrous, broad-chested, supreme among men, and a lion-like person with the strides of 
prancing lion, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. 
"He who is a valiant one with a face like that of full-moon, a prince with his self-conquered, and he 
who is expressly acclaimed and effectively armed, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. 
"You being a fox you woo me who am an absolutely inaccessible lioness? Why wooing, it is impossible 
for you to touch me as with the untouchable Shine of the Sun. 
"You who are an ill-fated demon, oh, demon, by your wooing the dear wife of Raghava, thus you must be 
visualising many golden trees, undeniably. 
"Do you wish to twitch fangs from the mouth of a ravenous lion, the expeditious challenger of animals, 
and from the mouth of a rebounding venomous serpent. 
"Do you wish to steal away the massive Mandara Mountain by the sleight of your hand, but how do you 
wish to decamp healthily without consuming lethal poison? 
"If you wish to override the dear wife of Raghava, then it is as good as wishing to deeply scrape your 
eyes with needlepoint, and licking the razorblade with your tongue. 
"You who wish to bitterly intimidate the dear wife of Rama are as good as the one who wish to swim an 
ocean arraying a boulder around his neck, and with a pair of hands you wish to steal away both the Sun 
and Moon? 
"You who wish to abduct me with an auspicious legend as the wife of Rama, thus you wish to steal away 
a glowing fire in a cloth-bundle, though evincing it to be highly flaming? 
"You who wish to override the befitting and selfsame wife of Rama, are wishing to tread on the needle-sharp 
spikes of iron spears. 
"Which odds are there between a lion and a fox in a given forest, which odds are there between a turbid-rivulet 
and an ocean, and which odds are there between a fine-wine and sour-gruel, likewise you are also at 
odds with the son of Dasharatha. 
"Which imparity is there among the metals of gold and lead, which imparity is there among the waters 
of sandalwood and sewage, which imparity is there between an elephant and a wildcat of forests, such 
an imparity exists between you and the son of Dasharatha. 
"Which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a crow and an eagle, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a waterfowl 
and a peacock, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a swan and a falcon living in forest, such a dissimilarity 
obtains betwixt you and the son of Dasharatha. 
"Even if you steal me away now, later when Indra similar Rama posits himself with his bow and arrows 
in hand on the battlefield, you cannot live on, and in the meanwhile you cannot digest me, as with a 
diamond swallowed along with a fly." Thus Seetha gave her vent to her disdainful feelings towards Ravana. 

On speaking these sentences with high-strung words, with all her unsullied intentions to that highly 
sullied night-rambler Ravana, her fragile body trembled tormentedly as with a banana plant up-heaved 
by gust. 
On closely marking Seetha to be tremulous, he that Ravana whose impetus is Death similar, clearly informed 
her of his name, caste, competency, and capability as his purpose is to cause scare. Hearing the words of Ravana, those demons who were strong, stupid and without moral conduct, 
all raising up their joined palms and spoke to Ravana the king of demons, without knowing the strengths 
of their enemy's side (as follows):
"Oh, king! Our army, equipped with iron bars, javelins, double-edged swords, darts and 
sharp-edged spears, is very great. Why are you getting worried?"
"After proceeding to Bhogavati city (the abode of Nagas in Patala one of the seven regions 
under the earth), the serpents there were defeated by you. Kubera (the bestower of riches) who resides 
on the peak of Mount Kailasa, surrounded by many yakshas (a class of demi-gods) surrendered to you after 
doing a great battle."
"Oh, Lord! By your rage, Kubera who was boasting himself for his friendship with Lord 
Shiva (the Supreme Lord) and said to be a guardian of the world possessing great strength, was defeated 
by you in battle."
"Throwing down a group of Yakshas, after causing a flutter among them and taking them 
in prison, this aerial car (Pushpak) was procured by you from Mount Kailasa."
"Oh, the best of ogres! By Maya, the lord of demons, Mandodari his daughter was given 
to you in marriage, due to fear from you and duly desiring your friendship."
Oh, mighty armed! Madhu Kumbhinasa's (your sister's) husband, another ruler of demons, 
who was proud of his valour and who was difficult to be defeated, was taken into your subjugation, your 
having won a battle against him."
"Oh, mighty armed! After moving down to rasatala (the penultimate subterranean region), 
the you conquered serpent-demons Vasukim Takshaka, Saukha and Jati were conquered by you and captivated 
as your subjects."
"Oh, annihilator of enemies, Commander of demons and the Lord! You after performing a 
battle for a year by you mighty demons who were beyond destruction, who were valiant and who obtained 
boons (for immortality) were defeated using your own strength in combat. Several fascinating tricks 
also were learnt from them."
"Oh, illustrious king! Varuna's sons, valiant strong and who were followed by an army 
having four limbs (viz. elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry) were defeated by you in a battle."
Oh, king! After entering a great ocean in the shape of Yama's realm, with a huge alligator 
in the form of death's rod of punishment, adorned with silk-cotton trees (bristling with thorns to be 
used a weapons), turbulent with a huge wave in the shape of noose of Kala (Time Spirit), with serpents 
in the form of Yama's servants and difficult to be conquered on account of mighty Jvara (Spirit presiding 
over fevers), and churning the sea in the form of Yama's forces, a great victory was obtained and death 
warded off by you. All the people there were delighted to see your good battle."
"The earth was filled, like with big trees, with many warriors who were strong with a 
courage equal to that Devendra (Lord of celestials).
"Oh, King! Rama was not equal to them in combat, by their valour excellence and energy. 
Those warriors, who were difficult to be overcome in battle, were overpowered and killed by you."
Oh, emperor! Why exertion to you? You remain here. Oh, emperor! This Indrajit alone can 
destroy the monkeys."
"Oh, emperor! After performing an excellent sacrifice to propitiate Mahesvara (the great 
lord shiva), a boon very rare to be obtained in the world, was acquired by him."
"Approaching that huge ocean of army of celestials, whose fish are lanes and spheres, 
whose guts thrown asunder as duck-weeds, whose turtles are the elephants, whose frogs are the teeming 
horses, infested with alligators in the form of (eleven) Rudras (gods of destruction) and (twelve) Adityas 
(sons of Aditi), with huge serpents in the form of (forty nine) Maruts (wind gods) and (eight) Vasus, 
having chariots horses and elephants for its volume of waters and the sandy elephants for its volume 
of waters and the sandy banks its infantry, Devendra (Lord of celestials) was captured by him and was 
impelled to come to Lanka (as a detenu).
"Oh, king! Having been released by the orders of your grand father Brahma, Devendra who 
killed demons called Shambara and Vrita and who was adored by all celestials, went back to heaven."
"Oh, emperor! You send that Indrajit alone, so that the army of monkeys together with 
Rama will be brought to an end."
"Oh, king! This unbefitting danger has come froma a man who is ordinary. It is not to 
be kept by you in mind, you will kill Rama."While highly wise monkey-troops and the demons were fighting a terrible military
ferocity arose in them.
Those demons, the best of ogres, doing terrific acts and eager to triumph in
Ravana's name, marched ahead on steeds with golden trappings or elephants resembling pointed
flames, or in chariots flashing like the sun and themselves wearing beautiful armours, creating
reverberant sounds in the ten regions.
The great army of monkeys, also eager to triumph, marched opposite to those troops
of demons of terrible acts.
Extra-ordinary duels arose between those demons and monkeys, who ran up towards each
other.
The demon Indrajit of immense energy fought with Angada the son of Vali, as the
demon Andhaka fought with Shiva the Lord of destruction.
The ever indomitable Sampati fought with Prajangha and Hanuman the monkey measured
his strength with Jambumali.
The demon with great fury, Vibhishana the younger brother of Ravana confronted with
Shatrughna possessing fiery velocity in battle.
Gaja of great strength fought with a demon called Tapana and Nila too of great
energy fought with Nikumbha.
Sugreeva the king of monkeys confronted well with Praghasa and the glorious
Lakshmana confronted with Virupaksha in the battle.
The invincible Agniketu, Rashmiketu, Mitraghnu and Yajnakopa confronted with
Rama.
Vajramushti confronted with Mainda and Ashaniprabha with Dvivida. Those principal
monkeys Mainda and Dvivida confronted with those highly terrific demons.
Pratapana, the valiant, terrific and invincible in battle fought well with Nala of
intense speed in battle.
That great monkey called Sushena, the strong son of Yama fought with Vidyunmali.
Some other dreadful monkeys, having finished their fight with many demons, swiftly
got a duel with some other demons.
A very great tumultuous battle, which caused hair to stand on end, continued there
between heroic demons and monkeys, who were eager to triumph.
Streams of blood flowed from the bodies of monkeys and demons, with turfs of hair
and carrying bodies in the stream, like timber.
The enraged Indrajit struck the valiant Angada (who can tear asunder the enemy
forces) with a mace, like Indra the Lord of celestials with his thunder-bolt.
The swift monkey, Angada struck his chariot, having a variegated body of gold, along
with horses and the charioteer in the battle.
Sampati, who was struck by Prajangha with three arrows, killed Prajangha by an
Ashvakarna tree, at the zenith of the combat.
Jambumali, standing in his chariot, full of strength and fury banged on Hanuman's
breast, with a javelin kept in his chariot, on the field of battle.
Hanuman, the son of the wind-god, ascended his chariot and soon overthrew it
together with the demon, with the palm of his hand.
That terrific Pratapana, while roaring, ran towards Nala. Nala suddenly scratched
out Pratapana's eyes.
Pierced in the limbs by sharp arrows by Praghasa the swift-handed demon, Sugreeva
the Lord of demons immediately killed Praghasa (who was appearing to swallow the monkey-troops)
with a Saptaparna tree.
Lakshmana with a terrific look, having tormented Virupaksha the demon with a shower
of arrows, finally killed him with an arrow.
The invincible Agniketu, Rashmiketu, Mitrughna and Yajnakopa wounded Rama by
arrows.
The enraged Rama on his part chopped the hands of those four demons in the battle by
his four terrific arrows having fire-like points.
Struck with a fist by Mainda in the battle, Vajramushti along with his chariot fell
to the ground like a watch-tower on a city-wall.
Nikumbha chopped Nila, having a radiance of a mass of collyrium in battle, by his
sharp arrows, like a cloud by the rays of the sun.
Then, Nikumbha the swift-handed demon again wounded Nila by a hundred arrows in the
battle and laughed continuously.
Nila chopped the head of the charioteer of Nikumbha by the wheel of the same chariot
in that fight, as Vishnu the Lord of preservation (by his Chakra, a circular missile weapon) in a
battle.
Even Dvivida, whose impact was like a flash of lightening of a thunder bolt, struck
Ashaniprabha with a rock before the eyes of all the demons.
That Ashaniprabha wounded Dvivida the monkey leader by his thunder bolt-like arrows,
while Dvivida was fighting with trees in the battle.
With his limbs struck by arrows, that Dvivida agitated as he was by anger, struck
with a Sala tree, Ashaniprabha, his chariot and the horses.
Vidyunmali, seated in a chariot, struck Sushena repeatedly with arrows adorned with
gold and made a roaring sound.
Sushena the excellent monkey, seeing him mounted on a chariot, quickly caused the
chariot to fall down, by a huge rock.
Retreating soon from the chariot, Vidyunmali the demon endowed with a skill, stood
on the ground with a mace in his hand.
Then, the excellent monkey, Sushena engulfed as he was with anger, seizing a very
huge rock in his hands, chased that demon.
Vidyunmali the ranger of the night; struck that approaching Sushena the excellent
monkey, quickly with a mace on his chest.
Not minding that terrific blow with the mace in the great battle, Sushena the
excellent monkey silently threw that huge rock on his chest.
Struck by the thump of that rock, Vidyunmali the demon, his chest crushed, fell
lifeless on the earth.
Those strong demons were destroyed thus by those valiant monkeys there in a series
of hand to hand encounters, as the demons were destroyed by the blows of the celestials.
The battle-field became frightening with extra-ordinary spears, other arrows, maces,
javelins, lances and some other weapons with three points, shattered chariots and military steeds
elephants in rut, monkeys and demons which had been killed, wheels axles and yokes broken and lying
on the ground and frequented as it was by herds of jackals.
The headless trunks of monkeys and demons sprang up here and there in the midst of
that tumultuous conflict, which resembled the war between celestials and demons.
Then, the rangers of the night, with their limbs anointed with blood after being
attacked by the excellent monkeys, longed for sun-set and again with strength, assembled for a good
combat.On seeing them as the wielders of the best weapons and audacious ones, two brothers and great souls, namely Rama and Lakshmana, Sugreeva became ambiguous.
Distressed at heart that foremost monkey gazed blankly in all directions and did not remain at any one place.
On seeing those two great mighty ones that monkey has not even made up his mind steadfast as he is very much frightened, and his heart is sunken.
He that righteous Sugreeva considering his strength and weakness is much agitated, and along with all the other monkeys too is frightened.
On seeing Rama and Lakshmana then that chief of monkeys Sugreeva with much dreadfulness said this to his ministers.
"Here they come wearing jute cloths and move about in this impassable forest deceitfully, definitely Vali must have dispatched them...
Then on seeing the great archers Rama and Lakshmana the ministers of Sugreeva have gone from that mountain terrace to another high-peaked mountain.
Then the group leaders of monkeys quickly arrived as they fled, at that lofty monkey group leader Sugreeva, the chieftain of monkeys, gathered around him there they stood at his nearby.
Thus they reached one course of return, after hopping from one mountain to the other, shuddering mountains and even their peaks by their trample in hastiness.
Then all of the tree-branch animals, who are great in their strength, have wrecked down the well-flowered trees that are clumped in that forest on that mountain by their swinging.
While those best monkeys hopped everywhere they frightened deer, wildcats, and tigers on that great mountain.
Then the ministers of Sugreeva assembled on that best mountain and gathered around the chief of monkeys Sugreeva and all stood with their adjoined palms.
Then Hanuma, the ablest sentence-maker, said this sentence to Sugreeva who is dismayed with fear doubting Vali's mischief.
"Perplexity be warded off... all of you discarded that great fear from Vali or his cruelty... there is no scare from Vali here on this best mountain, for it is Mt. Malaya...
"By whom you are bewildered at heart and running away, oh, the best monkey Sugreeva, I do not see that cruel-looking, cruel Vali here...
"From whom your fear is spurted, oh, gentle Sugreeva, that elder brother of yours, who is an evildoer and the one with harmful intent... that Vali is not here. Therefore I perceive no fear from him...
"Aha! You made a monkey of yourself, oh, monkey, and you feel small, thus you are not able to stay firm in your mind by that fickleness, and your monkeyshines are clear by it...
"Keep your intellect and wisdom firm, and express all your intents rightly in your body language in all your undertakings... certainly, a king getting into unintelligence cannot command all his subjects..." So said Hanuma to Sugreeva.
Sugreeva thus hearing entirely to all the propitious words of Hanuma spoke to Hanuma this opportune sentence, positively.
"Lengthy are their arms, broad are their eyes and they are the wielders of arrows, bows, and swords... and on seeing them, to whom there will be no scare? These two are like the sons of some divinity..." Sugreeva thus spoke to Hanuma.
"I presume these two... those best of men are abetted by Vali to assault me... for, the kings like Vali do have many friends, and trusting them is an unpardonable mistake...
"By men, the enemies are to be assessed... for, they move in disguise and distrustful enemies will trounce the complacently self-assured ones that relax in their self-confidence on any possible occasion...
"In exploits, Vali is an ingenious one... and the kings will be observing many aspects of their enemies to eliminate them... and they the kings are to be known even by ordinary people...
"Begone to them oh, monkey Hanuma, in a commoner's form, for your monkey-hood is distinguishable by Vali's agents, and know the intentions of those two by their conduct, by their semblance, and by their conversation, as well...
"Aim at their concepts and if they are pleasant-hearted, duly create confidence in them by conducting yourself, and also commending them again and again... oh, best of monkeys, Hanuma, set their face towards me alone in a compassionate manner, and you inquire about the reason for their entering this forest alone... of those bows wielders...
"You shall know whether those two are clean at heart or otherwise, or about their evil-mindedness or otherwise by conversation..." Thus Sugreeva said to Hanuma.
Thus this way ordered by Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, Hanuma, the son of Air-god made up his mind to go there, where Rama and Lakshmana are.
That marvelous monkey Hanuma agreed with the words of that inaccessible and very much frightened Sugreeva, and on respectfully replying to him saying that, 'I will do accordingly...' proceeded there where that highly mighty Rama is there along with Lakshmana.Rama, who was unweary in action, with his shining arrows adorned with pure gold,
killed those thousands of elephants dispatched by Ravana, thousands of horses, valiant demons who
can change their form at will mounted on thousands of chariots with their flag-staffs, having the
colour of fire, fighting with maces and iron rods and conspicuous with their golden banners.
Seeing and hearing about the killing of the demons, the surviving demons well
frightened, looked sad and were overwhelmed with anxiety. They wailed when they met their wives.
All female-demons who lost their husbands, sons and kinsfolk met at one place, stricken as they
were with sorrow, wailed as follows:
"How did the old and ugly Surpanakha, of sunken belly, approach, in the forest, Rama
who is charming like the god of love?"
"How strange that on seeing that Rama of tender youth, endowed with extraordinary
strength and devoted to the welfare of all created beings, that ugly woman (Surpanakha) who
deserved to be condemned by the people, was stung with excessive lust?"
"How that ugly-faced demoness, who is bereft of all virtues, dared to make love to
Rama, who is full of virtues, endowed with great bodily strength and who possessed a charming
countenance?"
"Because of the ill-luck of these people, and to the destruction of demons and of
Dushana and Khara, that grey-haired and disgusting woman, who had developed wrinkles, tried to be
arrogant with Rama, misdeed which was worth ridiculing and condemned by the whole world."
"For the sake of that Surpanakha, Ravana built this huge enmity. For his own
destruction, Ravana the demon brought that Seetha."
"Ravana cannot obtain Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, but an endless enmity has been
built with the mighty Rama."
"Seeing that instance of Rama killing single-handedly Viradha the demon, who was
yearning for Seetha, is enough indeed (to convince Ravana of Rama's strength and ability)"
"In Janasthana, Rama killed fourteen thousand demons who were doing terrific feats,
with his arrows resembling tongues of fire."
"In that battle, Khara, Dushana and Trishira were killed with arrows resembling the
sun. That instance should have been sufficient (to open the eyes of Ravana)."
"Further, that Kabandha having arms with a length of eight miles each, with blood as
his food and roaring with anger was killed. That instance should have been sufficient."
"Rama killed the mighty Vali, the son of Indra the lord of celestials, looking like
the black cloud. That instance should have been sufficient. (To open the eyes of Ravana)"
"The kingdom was restored to the miserable Sugreeva, who was residing in Mount
Rishyamuka, living with his wishes disappointed. That instance should prove sufficient. (To open
the eyes of Ravana)."
"The appropriate advice tendered by Vibhishana which was conformable to duty and
interest of Ravana as also beneficial to all the demons, was not to the liking to him, due to his
ignorance."
"Had Ravana followed Vibhishana's advice, this Lanka would not have become a burial
ground, tormented by sorrow."
"Ravana is not able to learn a lesson, even after hearing that the mighty
Kumbhakarna was killed by Rama and that unconquerable colossal-bodied Indrajit, his beloved son was
killed by Lakshmana."
"Ravana is not able to learn a lesson, even after hearing that the mighty
Kumbhakarna was killed by Rama and that the unconquerable colossal-bodied Indrajit, his beloved son
was killed by Lakshmana."
"The valiant Rama killed hundreds and thousands of chariots, horses and elephants in
the battle. He killed even the foot soldiers too."
"Rama, coming in the form of either Rudra the lord of destruction or Vishnu, the
lord of preservation, or Indra the lord of celestials who performed one hundred ritual sacrifices,
or otherwise Yama, the Lord of Death himself, is killing us."
"As Rama killed all our great warriors, we are lamenting with a loss of hope in our
lives, failing to see an end to our fear and having become helpless."
"The valiant Ravana, having been gifted with great boons by Brahma, is not able to
understand this greatly terrific calamity, coming forth from the hand of Rama."
"Neither the celestials nor Gandharvas the celestial musicians nor the evil spirits
nor the demons are able to protect Ravana, who is about to attack Rama in battle."
"Bad omens are appearing for Ravana, as and when his warriors are setting out for
each combat. They are indeed telling about the prospective annihilation of Ravana by Rama."
Brahma, the lord of creation, gratified by the austerity of Ravana, gave protection
to Ravana from celestials, demons and ogres. But Ravana did not seek protection from human
beings."
"I think that such a calamity has come from that humanity only dreadfully causing an
end to the lives for the demons and for Ravana too. There is no doubt about it."
"The celestials, tormented by the mighty Ravana, because of the misuse of the boon
bestowed on him, worshipped Brahma the lord of creation with their glowing austerities."
"The great-souled Brahma, duly gratified, spoke for the benefit of those celestials,
the following words to them:
"From today onwards, all the ogres and demons, constantly enveloped with fear, will
be wandering always in the three worlds."
"All the celestials together with Indra and others, got propitiated by Shiva the
lord of destruction, with the ensign of a bull on his flag-staff and who destroyed the three strong
cities built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth for demons."
"The gracious Shiva spoke the following words to the celestials: 'For your benefit,
a woman will be born, for causing destruction of the demons.'"
"This Seetha, the destroyer of demons, employed by the celestials, will consume us
along with Ravana, as in the past hunger consumed the demons."
"As a result of the bad behaviour of Ravana, the wicked demon with an evil
disposition of mind, this terrific havoc with grief occurred."
"Rama is occupying us, as the Death occupies at the time of dissolution of the
universe. We do not find any one now, who can give protection to us in this world."
"There is no refuge whatsoever for us, who stand in great danger, as indeed there is
no shelter for female-elephants, enveloped by a wild fire in a forest."
"The great-souled Vibhishana did something opportune. He sought refuge in him alone
from whom such a peril is perceived."
Then, all female-demons, embracing each other in their arms, afflicted as they were
with grief and tormented with excessive fear, lamented thus and wept loudly and severely.Hearing the cries of these who were thus wailing, the virtuous minded Rama then
became thoughtful for a while, afflicted as he was with melancholy, his eyes filled with tears.
Thereupon, Kubera the King of Yakshas, Yama the lord of death together with the
deceased ancestors, Indra the lord of celestials Varuna the lord of waters, the illustrious Shiva
the great deity who bears the device of a bull as his banner and having three eyes, Brahma the
creator of all the worlds and the best among the knowers of sacred knowledge all these together
reaching the City of Lanka in aerial cars, shining like the sun approached Rama.
Lifting their long arms, their hands decked with ornaments, those excellent gods
thereupon, spoke (as follows) to Rama who stood there, making a respectful salutation to them with
his folded hands.
"How do you, the maker of the entire cosmos, the foremost among those endowed with
knowledge and an all-capable person, ignore Seetha who is falling into the fire? How do you not
recognize yourself to be the foremost of the troop of gods?"
"Among the Vasus (a class of gods, eight in number), you are the Vasu, named
R^itadhama (one whose abode is Truth or the Divine Law) who was formerly the self-constituted
ruler, the first creator of all the three worlds and the lord of creatures."
"You are the eighth Rudra among (eleven) Rudras and the fifth (Viryavan by name)
among the Sadhyas (a particular class of celestials belonging to Gana Devata). The twin Aswinis are
your ears. The sun and the moon constitute your eyes."
"O the destroyer of the adversaries. You are seen (to exist) at the beginning and at
the end of creation. Yet, you ignore Seetha, just like a common man."
Hearing the words of those guardians of the world, Rama, the lord of creation, who
was born in Raghu dynasty and the foremost one among protectors of righteousness, spoke to those
god-chiefs as follows:
"I think of myself to be a human being, by name Rama, the son of Dasaratha. You, as
a gracious Divinity, tell me that which I as such really am like this."
Hearing the words of Rama, Brahma (the creator), the foremost among the knowers of
Brahma the Absolute, spoke as follows: "Listen to my true word, O the truly brave lord!"
"You are the Lord Narayana himself the glorious god, who wields the discus. You are
the Divine Boar with a single tusk, the conqueror of your past and future enemies."
"You are Brahma, the imperishable, the Truth abiding in the middle as well as at the
end of the universe. You are the supreme righteousness of people, whose powers go everywhere. You
are the four-armed."
"You are the wielder of a bow called Sarnga, the lord of the senses, the supreme
soul of the universe, the best of men, the invincible, the wielder of a sword named Nandaka, the
all-pervader, the bestower of happiness to the earth and endowed with great might."
"You are the leader of the army and the village headman. You are the intellect. You
are the endurance and the subduer of the senses. You are the origin and the dissolution of all,
Upendra the Divine Dwarf and (the younger brother of Indra) as also the destroyer Madhu, the
demon."
"You perform action for Indra the lord of celestials, the Supreme Ruler, the one
having a lotus in one's navel and who puts an end to all in battle. The divine sages pronounce you
to be fit to afford protection to all and the refuge for all."
"In the form of the Vedas, you are the great Bull with hundred heads (rules) and
thousand horns (precepts). You are the first creator of all, the three worlds, and the self
constituted Lord of all. You are the refuge and the forbear of Siddhas (a class of demi-gods
endowed with mystic powers by virtue of their very birth) and Sadhyas (a class of celestial
beings.)"
"You are the sacrificial performance. You are the sacred syllable 'Vashat' (on
hearing which the Adhvaryu priest casts the oblation to a deity into the sacrificial fire). You are
the mystic syllable 'OM'. You are higher than the highest. People neither know your end nor your
origin nor who you are in reality."
"You appear in all created beings in the cattle and in brahmanas. You exist in all
quarters, in the sky, in mountains and in rivers."
"With thousand feet, with hundred heads and with thousand eyes along with Lakshmi
the goddess of wealth, you bear the earth with all its created beings along with its
mountains."
"O Rama! You appear as Sesha, a large serpent in water, at the earth's bottom,
bearing the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas, the celestial musicians and the demons."
"O Rama! I (brahma) am your heart. Saraswathi, the goddess (of learning) is your
tongue. O lord! The gods created by Brahma are the hair on all your limbs."
"Night has been recognized as the closing of your eye-lids and the day, as the
opening of eye-lids. The correct usages of your words are the Vedas. Bereft of you, this visible
universe does not exist."
"The entire cosmos is your body. The earth constitutes your firmness. Fire is your
anger. The moon constitutes your placidity. You are Lord Vishnu (who bears the mark Srivatsa - a
curl of white hair on his breast)."
"In the past, the three worlds were occupied by you in your three strides, after
binding the exceptionally formidable Bali (the ruler of the three worlds) and Indra was made the
king (by you)."
"Seetha is no other than Goddess Lakshmi (the divine consort of Lord Vishnu), while
you are Lord Vishnu. You are having a shining dark-blue hue. You are the Lord of created beings.
For the destruction of Ravana, you entered a human body here, on this earth."
"O Rama, the foremost among the supporters of righteousness! The aforesaid purpose
of ours has been fulfilled. Ravana has been killed. Return to your divine abode, with a
rejoice."
"O Lord! Unerring is your valour. Your exploits are never in vain. O Rama! Your
blessed sight is powerful. The songs in praise of you never go in vain."
"Those humans who are full of devotion to you will never be unsuccessful on this
earth. Those who are devoted to you, the primeval and the eternal lord, belonging to ancient times
and the Supreme Person, will forever attain their desired objects here as well as hereafter."
"Humiliation will never be the plight of those humans who will recite this hymn in a
divine ancient history, sung by Brahma, the foremost seer."Then, Rama Seetha and Lakshmana, who felt miserable, bowed down by touching the feet of the king and went round him clockwise with joined palms.
After taking leave of Dasaratha, Rama who knew what is right and stood confounded by sorrow, bowed along with Seetha to Kausalya.
Immediately following his brother, Lakshmana too bowed to Kausalya, then clasped the feet of his mother Sumitra.
Smelling (as a token of affection) the head of Lakshmana mighty armed, who was
saluting her, his mother Sumitra who wished well of him, spoke weepin, to that son of her ( as follows)
"Highly fond of your kinsman Rama, you have been pemitted (by me) to dwell in the
forest(with your eldest half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother Rama, who is going to the forest, my son!"
"Oh, sinless one! Whether in adversity or in riches, he alone is refugee to you. It should become the code of conduct in the world, that younger brother should be subject to the control of his elder brother."
"It is indeed a practice right from ancient times in your race, to make gifts, to
dedicate onself to performance of sacrificial rites and to foresake one's body to fight battles."
Thus speaking to Lakshmana, who was in readiness to leave the forest and who loved Rama dearly, Sumitra repeatedly said to him, "fare forth, fare forth!"
"Know Rama to be Dasaratha. Look upon Seetha the daughter of Janaka as myself.
Consider the forest as Ayodhya and depart happily, my son!"
Then, Sumantra the humble man, who was aware of humility, joined his palms and spoke these words to Rama even as Matali(charioteer of Indra) would to Indra (the ruler of gods).
"Mount the chariot, oh the highly illustrious prince! May all be well with you! I
shall take you speedily, wherever you direct me to go."
"you have to reside in the forest for fourteen years. Those years, as directed by
the queen, are to be considered having commenced."
Having adorned herself, Seetha with her comely buttocks, mounted with a delighted
mind, that chariot which was shining like the sun.
Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers quickly mounted that chariot, which was replendent like fire and decked with gold.
For Seetha who was accompanying with her husband, Dasaratha gave away garments and jewellery, taking into consideration the period for which she had to stay in the forest.
Even so for the two brothers, keeping the sets of weapon, an armour of hard make
with leather-cover in the midst of the chariot, Sumantra saw the three of whom Seetha constituted the third mounted and quickly drove the horses which were highly admired, with their swiftness resembling the velocity of wind.
Rama after departing to the great forest for a long term, unconsciousness prevailed in the city. There was faintness in the strength of people.
The city( of Ayodhya) is filled with flurry, with its elephants intoxicated in rut and highly excited and resonant with tinkling of ornaments of horses.
That city, including the youngsters and the old, stricken with extreme agony, ran
towards Rama alone, in the same way as the one afflicted with heat of the sun rushes towards water.
Having down towards sides and back of the chariot with their faces turned towards
Rama and with their faces filled with tears, all those people said with loud voices to Sumantra thus:
"Hold in the reins of the horses and go slowly and slowly, Oh charioteer! We would behold the face of Rama, which would be henceforth difficult to behold for us"
"The heart of Rama's mother(Kausalya) is surely and undoubtedly made of iron, since it does not get broken when Rama resembling an offspring of gods is going to the forest"
"Seetha(the princess of Videha kingdom) has done what ought to be done, by going
along with him like a shadow, delighted in virtue as she was and does not leave her husband in the same way as Mount Meru does not leave the efflugence of sun"
"Oh, Lakshmana! You are attending ever to your brother who speaks affectionately and is equal to the god. Ah, you are the accomplisher of purpose!"
"It is an immense fulfilment for you, it is a tremendous good fortune for you, nay, it is even a means to heaven that you are following this Rama"
Saying so, those people were not able to restrain their tears that come and followed that Rama, their beloved delight of the Ikshvakus.
Then, the king with the distressed mind, saying that he would behold his beloved
saw, came out of his palace surrounded by women who were too dejected.
In front of him was heard a huge noise of crying women, echoing like trumpeting of female elephants when a lordly elephant has been pinioned.
At that time, the father of Rama as is well known as a glorious king Dasaratha(a
scion of Kakutstha) looked shrunk, like the full moon oversadowed by an eclipse.
That glorious son of Dasaratha(Rama) of inconceivable courage, directed the
charioteer in the words "Let the chariot be driven fast."
Rama commanded that charioteer with the words "Move on!" The people said to him
"stop!" Urged on the passage, the charioteer could not do both.
The dust raised on the road due to moving out of mighty armed Rama, was suppressed by the falling tears of the citizens.
With full of wailing tears, the citizens of after making loud cries became
unconscious with deep agony, at the time of departure of Rama.
Tears born of anguish flowed from the eyes of women like(drops of) water falling
from lotuses by the commotion of fish.
Seeing the city with singleness of mind, the glorious monarch Dasaratha fell down
with agony, like a tree slain at its root.
Thereafter, seeing the king becoming feeble and much distressed, the outery of the people rose from the rear of Rama.
Some poeple crying "Oh, Rama!" and some other scrying "Oh, Rama's mother!", made the entire women in the gynaecium to weap.
Looking back, Rama saw the king sorrowful and perplexed in mind, as well as his
mother following (him) on the road.
Rama, bound by the chord of righteousness, could not gaze openly at his parents, as a foal caught in asnare would not properly look at its dam.
Seeing them coming by foot, though worthy of a chariot, habituated to comfort and
unworthy of suffering, Rama commanded the charioteer with words: "Drive fast!"
Rama the tiger among men, feeling pained, as an elephant being pricked by a good,
indeed was not able to bear that plight of his father and his mother.
Rama's mother (Kausalya) ran towards her son, as a cow fond of her calf and whose
calf is tied(in a stall), runs home for her calf.
Rama again and again saw that Kausalya, his mother who was crying thus, running
after that chariot as though dancing, shouting"Oh, Rama, Rama!" "Oh, Seetha!" and "Oh, Lakshmana!" trickling tears descending from her eyes for the sake of Rama Lakshmana and Seetha.
Dasaratha exclaimed saying "Stop!" while Rama called out "Go on, proceed!" (In that way) Sumantra's mind became confused, as in between two (opposing) whirl pools.
Rama said to him: "You can say to the king that you did not hear (his call), even
when scolded (later). seeing their grief for a long time is quite unbearbale."
The charioteer, doing as per Rama's words, took leave of those citizens and drive
the horses more speedily even while they are going.
The king's people returned after (mentally) going round Rama. Their minds did not
return. Their impulse of tears also did not get reduced.
The ministers spoke to king Dasaratha as follows:" We should not follow to a long
distance him whom we wish to see come back."
Hearing their words, which were befilting with all virtues, the king Dasaratha felt miserable, stopped short, gazing along with his wife, at his son Rama, with his whole body perspiring and wearing a dejected look.Having spent the beautiful night under the big tree, Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana
started from that place when the immaculate sun had risen.
Having penetrated into a deep forest, they the illustrious trios, while seeing many stretches of land and at some places, attractive scenery never seen before, proceeded in the direction of that region where river Yamuna was flowing forth towards river Ganga, associated with the name of Emperor Bhagiratha.
Observing various trees while walking at ease, Rama spoke to Lakshmana (as follows) when the day had just receded.
"Perceive, Oh Lakshmana, the smoke looking prominent as a sign of the glorious god of fire near Prayaga (the confluence of the holy Ganga and Yamuna rivers). I think that sage Bharadwaja is staying nearby."
"We have certainly reached the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Yes, the noise produced by clashing of waters is heard."
"Pieces of timber split up by men who are dependent upon forest-products, as also
these trees of various kinds are seen in the hermitage of Bharadwaja."
Having walked comfortably, Rama and Lakshmana wielding their bows, reached the abode of the sage Bhardwaja, near the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna, while the Sun was falling to the west.
Having reached the hermitage and scaring the beasts and birds (by his very
appearance as a bowman) and having proceeded on the intervening path for a while, Rama approached the vicinity of Bharadwaja.
Arriving at the hermitage, the two valiant princes, who wished to see the sage,
accompanied by Seetha, halted at first at some distance off.
Entering the hermitage and beholding the high-souled sage who was austere and
contemplative, his glance sharpened through severe meditation, surrounded by a group of disciples, who had kindled sacrificial fire, the highly fortunate man as he was, Rama together with Lakshmana and Seetha greeted him with joined palms.
Rama (the elder brother of Lakshmana) introduced himself to the sage as follows: "Oh venerable sage! We both are Rama and Lakshmana the sons of Dasaratha."
"Here is my blessed and irreproachable wife Seetha, daughter of Janaka who has
accompanied me to the lonely forest suitable for religious austerities."
"While I was being sent to exile by my father, my young and beloved brother
Lakshmana (son of Sumitra) of firm vows has also followed me to the forest."
"Oh, Venerable sage! Commanded by our father, we are entering a lonely forest to
practise asceticism, living on roots and fruits."
Hearing the words of that virtuous prince (Rama), the pious minded sage Bharadwaja then offered Madhuparka* as well as water to wash his hands with.
The sage, who had practiced austerities, gave them various kinds of delicacies
prepared from wild roots and fruits and also arranged accommodation for them.
Honouring with words of welcome, the sage Bharadwaja seated, being surrounded on all sides with beasts, birds and hermits, spoke thus to Rama.
Bharadwaja then said these endowed with righteousness to Rama, who had since taken his seat after accepting the aforesaid hospitality:
"In fact, I am seeing you, arriving here after a long time, Oh scion of Kakutstha! And I have heard of your unjust banishment."
"This holy place at the confluence of the two rivers is secluded and delightful. You stay here comfortably."
Addressed in these words by Bharadwaja, Rama, born in Raghu dynasty, for his part, interested in the welfare of all, replied in the following pleasant words.
"The people of the city and the rural folks Oh venerable sir, are nearer to this
place. Finding me easy to see at this place, people keen to see Seetha and myself, I presume, will make their appearance at this hermitage. For this reason, I do not wish to stay here."
"See some excellent Seetha suitable for a hermitage in some lonely place, Oh
venerable sir, where Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who is worthy of every comfort, may find delight in it."
Hearing these auspicious words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage then for his part spoke these suggestive words.
"Sixty miles from here, dear son, lies a sacred mountain on which you may takeup
your dwelling, which region is inhabited by great sages, is charming to look at from all sides, infested by the black species of monkeys with a long tail, haunted by apes and bears, known by the name of Chitrakuta and which closely resembles Gandha maadana mountain."
"As long as a man observes the peaks of Chitrakuta mountain, he will perform
virtuous deeds and will never set his mind on a sin."
"On that mountain, many sages having spent hundred years in austerities as though in sport , ascended to heaven, duly attaining their final emancipation."
"I consider that mountain to be a very lonely and comfortable place for you to live in. Orelse stay with m here itself, during the period of your exile, Oh Rama!"
The pious sage Bharadwaja fulfilled all desires of Rama; who was his beloved guest and who was accompanied by his consort, Seetha and his brother, Lakshmana.
While Rama, having approached that great sage at Prayaga(the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna), was discoursing on various topics, the auspicious night arrived.
Greatly fatigued, Rama(Scion of Kakutstha) accompanied by Seetha as the third
(Lakshmana being the second) who was accustmed to all comforts, happily spent that night at the lovely hermitage of Bharadwaja.
When the night was gleaming into a dawn, Rama the lion among men approached the sage Bharadwaja, who was gleaming with resplendence and spoke as follows:
"We have lodged in your hermitage tonight, Oh venerable sir! (Pray) you give us
permission for fixing our residence now, Oh sage practicing truthfulness !"
That night having come to an end, Bharadwaja replied for his part, as follows:
"Proced to Chitrakuta, rich in honey, tubers and fruits."
"I consider the abode of Chitrakuta as the right place for you to stay, Oh Rama,
possessed of great strength! You set off for that well-known, sacred and lovely mountain, Chitrakuta which is adoned with clusters of trees of every description, frequented by Kinnaras and Nagas, is rendered charming by the cried of peacocks and infested with lordly elephants and bountiful with tubers and fruits."
"Since herds of elephants and troops of deer wander all around in the woodlands
there, you will visibly notice them Oh Rama!"
"Roaming about with Seetha, your mind will be delighted to see rivers, cascades,
peaks of mountains, fissures in rocks, caves and rivulets."
"After reaching the auspicious and absolutely beautiful Chitrakuta mountain,
reveberant in all direction with the notes of small white cranes and cucukoo birds as well as with many kinds of deer and elephants in rut, settle down there in a hermitage."Sugreeva started to adore and extol Raghava on hearing the words of Rama that inculcated happiness and pride. 
"It is doubtless that you will burn down everything when you are angry, like the
blazing sun at the end of an era, with these arrows of yours that are highly blazing, incisive and
invaders on stealthy places." Thus Sugreeva started extolling Rama. 
"That which is impetuousness of Vali, that which is his bravery and courageousness
are there, they may listen to me single-mindedly, and later you impose that which need be
imposed."Before the dawn of the sun, Vali unweariedly strides from the western ocean to the eastern, and
even from southern to northern for offering water oblations to the rising sun. 
"Ascending the heights of mountains and even rending their greatest peaks, that
mighty one volleys them upwards and in turn catches them, as though they are play balls.

"As a show of his strength, Vali used to personally fell many sturdy trees of diverse
origin by his might. 
"One named Dundubhi was there in the form of a buffalo, whose size shone forth like
Mt. Kailash and who bears the strength of a thousand elephants." Thus Sugreeva started telling
Dundubhi's episode to Rama. 
"He that evil-minded and colossal-bodied Dundubhi was bemused by the vanity of his
vigour, and by the boon bestowed on him, and once he went to the lord of rivers, namely the
Ocean. 
"Deriding the garner of weaves and gems he said to that vast ocean "Give me a
fight" 
"Then, oh, Rama, that virtue-minded and very powerful ocean rose from his tabular
position to heights, and spoke these words to that demon Dundubhi who is driven to doom by his own
time. 
"I am not capable of giving you a fight, oh, war expert, but I will name him who can
give you a fight, listen." So said ocean to the demon. 
"A sublime shelter for sages and the father-in-law of Shankara is there in great
forests, well-known by the name Himavan, the king of mountains, and he embodies great cascades,
cataracts, and caves and he alone is capable of providing matchless happiness to you in the form of
a fight." So said Ocean to Dundubhi. 
"Fathoming that ocean to be scared of him that noted demon Dundubhi arrived at the
forests of Himavan like an arrow darted from the bow, and that Dundubhi started to blare discordantly
and toss the rock faces of that mountain that are like white elephants in their figuration,
severally. 
"Then he who is like a silver cloud in his figuration, a gentle and delightful one
in his appearance, that Himavan spoke these words to the demon staying on his cliff.

"It is inapt of you to annoy me, oh, virtuous Dundubhi, I am just a shelterer of
sages and an unskilled one in fights." So said Himavan to Dundubhi. 
"On hearing the words of that modest king of mountains Dundubhi's eyes are bloodshot
and he said this sentence.
"Whether you are incapable of fighting with me, or not venturing with me as you are scared
of me is not my concern, but tell me who can give me a very combative fight, 
On hearing Dundubhi's arrogant words that honest Himavan being an expert in
sentence-making had to say angry words to that fierce demon that were never uttered by him
earlier. 
"Oh, war-expert Dundubhi, Indra's son is there, a brave and glorious one by name
Vali, and he is now presiding over the matchlessly pompous city of Kishkindha. 
"He is a highly intelligent one and a war expert too, and he is the capable one to
give you a duel, like Indra to Namuchi.
"Approach him promptly if you desire a fight now, and he is an intrepid one who will
always be in the manoeuvres of war, and indeed none can assail him." Thus said Himavan to that
demon Dundubhi. 
"Then on hearing Himavan's words he that Dundubhi is convulsed in anger and
proceeded to Vali's city Kishkindha. 
"That great mighty demon Dundubhi wearing the look of a buffalo with sharp horns was
awe-inspiring, and like the arrival of a massive dark cloud in the rainy season full of water on the
edge of firmament, he arrived at the gateway of Kishkindha and bellowed clamorously like a war drum
as though to quake the earth. 
"He bellowed uprooting trees that were rooted nearby, scooping the earth with hooves,
and insolently goring the gateway with horns like a goring elephant.
"Vali who by then went into his palace chambers became intolerant to hearing that noise
and fell out from there along with ladies, like the moon with stars. 
"Vali being the lord of monkeys, and of all the other forest-dwellers as well, spoke
a worded brief sentence to Dundubhi. 
"Oh, Dundubhi, impeding the gateway of this city what for you are bellowing, I know
you, oh, might one, save your lives." Vali cautioned that demon that way. 
"On hearing that sentence of Vali, the tactful lord of monkeys, Dundubhi said this
sentence with his eyes bloodshot in anger." Thus Sugreeva continued his narration to Rama.

"It is inapt of you to speak words in the vicinity of ladies, oh, valiant Vali, give
me a duel now and then I can appreciate your might." 
"Otherwise I bear up my rage for this night, oh, monkey, you may unrestrainedly
delight yourself till morning in your voluptuous gratifications, for you are now surrounded by your
ladies." 
"Also embrace all the monkeys and bequeath endowments to them, and you may bid adieu
to all the good-hearted people of yours for you are the king of all the tree-branch animals, as you
may not see them later.
"Let Kishkindha city be seen clearly by you as the last sight, and keep someone
equalling you as in charge of the city, and also rejoice with the females till sunrise as there is no
tomorrow to you. 
"He who kills a drunken one, unvigilant one, defeated one, or one without weapons,
or an atrophied one, he gets the sin of foeticide in the world, and your present state is suchlike."
Dundubhi incited Vali in this way.
"Then Vali laughed that demon off, and discharged all the females namely Tara and
others, and then he spoke to that stupid lord of demons in anger. 
"Don't surmise that I am drunk, and should you be unafraid of a fight, regard this
drunkenness of mine as the toast of a gallant fighter in this deadly fight," Vali said so to
Dundubhi. 
"Saying that way to that Dundubhi that highly enraged Vali heaved up the golden
chest pendant around his neck onto his chest, which was given by his father Mahendra, and stood
firm for a fight. 
"Then that elephantine monkey Vali took that mountain-similar Dundubhi by horns, and
booming highly he whirled and bumped him onto the ground.
"Vali while blaring highly with great sound repeatedly whirled him and thrown onto
the ground, and while Dundubhi was hurled and thrown to the ground, blood gushed out of his two ears.

"There occurred a gruesome fight among those two, Dundubhi and Vali, who by their
fury are impetuous and aspire to victory over the other. 
"Then Vali who is similar to Indra in his fortitude fought with him with his fists,
knees and feet, and like that with boulders and trees. 
"While each is assaulting the other in that fight between that monkey and demon,
that demon is impaired and Indra's son Vali toughened. 
"In that life-taking fight when Dundubhi is lifted and flung to the ground, he is
completely pounded out.
"While he is felled down much blood is flown out from the vent holes of his body,
nine of them, ears, nose, eyes etc., and on his falling that mighty one Dundubhi attained the
fifth state.
"Then the hastiest Vali swayed that dead and inanimate demon with both of his hands
and hurled him a yojana distance in a single flick.
"And while he is thrown that hasty blood drops oozed from his mouth, and flung by
air they fell into the hermitage of sage Matanga. 
"On seeing the blood drops fallen there, oh Rama, that sage is enraged and thought,
'who is he indeed, who dropped the blood...' Thus Sugreeva narrated to Rama.
" 'By which evil-spirited one I am abruptly touched with blood? Who is that
evil-minded one? Who is that malevolent, disobedient and reckless one?' Thus the sage Matanga
pondered. 
"Thinking thus and coming out of the hermitage that celebrated sage has seen the
mountainous buffalo fell on the ground lifelessly. 
"On knowing by his ascetic power that this deed is done by the monkey, he released a
great curse on him who tossed the cadaver of buffalo. 
"Untreatable is this sheltering wood of mine to him who has stained it with squirts
of blood, and if he enters this place peradventure, a fatality occurs on him. 
"By his hurling the demon's body these trees are also destroyed, hence he
ought not to set his foot in a distance of one full yojana around this hermitage, and if that
evil-minded one places his foot then he does not exist. 
"And some of his friends that are dependent on my woods shall not live here and they
may depart on hearing my words and solace themselves with my words. 
"This forest of mine is always protected like my own son, and if the monkeys of Vali
wish to stay behind in this forest alone for further destruction of leaves or sprouts, or even for
the non-existence of fruits and tubers in this forest, defiantly they too will be cursed.

"And today is the day of limit and the monkey whom I will see tomorrow, he will be
petrified for many thousand years to come. 
"Then those monkeys on hearing the clear wording of the sage started from that
forest, and on their coming to Kishkindha, Vali saw them and spoke this way to them. 
" 'Why have all of you dwellers of Matanga forest arrived in my presence, even so, are
you the dwellers of that forest safe?' Thus Vali asked everyone. 
"Then all of those monkeys have reported to Vali, the one with a golden
chest pendant, all the reasons for their exit, likewise the curse to Vali. 
"Then on hearing all those words narrated by monkeys Vali approached that great sage
and begged of him to become humble with palm-fold. 
"The sage inconsiderate of Vali's request withdrew into a hermitage and fearing to
bear the brunt of the curse Vali was distraught and withdrew from that place.
"Then, dreaded by the fear of curse that monkey Vali does not aspire to enter the
great mountain Rishyamuka, oh, people's lord, Rama, or he does not even wish to look at it." Thus
Sugreeva continued his narration. 
"Knowing the inaccessibility of this forest to him I got rid of my agony, Rama, and
I moved here about in this great forest along with my ministers.
"This huge heap of bones that is shining forth like a mountaintop is that of
Dundubhi, which Vali once hurled by the vanity of his valour. 
"Also these are the seven enormous sala trees full of their branches, and Vali is
capable of making each of them leafless by his vigour, of course, one at a time. 
"Oh, Rama, I am apprising all this to tell about the unequalled vitality of Vali,
and oh, king, then how is it possible for you to eliminate Vali in war." Thus Sugreeva enquired
with Rama.
When Sugreeva spoke that way Lakshmana a little smiled and asked him, "On Performing
which act do you confide in the possibility of Vali's elimination?" 
Then Sugreeva said to Lakshmana, "Earlier Vali used to agitate each of the trees,
one after the other, on many occasions."
"If Rama can rend one tree out of the seven with only one arrow, then on seeing
Rama's valour I can construe that Vali is utterly dead at his hand. 
"Lakshmana, if he lifts and kicks the skeleton of this dead buffalo by the might of
his foot, and makes it fall at a distance of two hundred bow-lengths, I can confide." So said
Sugreeva to Lakshmana. 
Sugreeva paused for a while on saying thus to Rama, for Rama's eye corners were
reddened with anger towards Vali, and then Sugreeva again spoke to Rama. "Vali is a mighty monkey, an intrepid one, who esteems his intrepidity, and one
who is well renowned for his might and tenacity, and in combats he is an undefeated one.

"His deeds that are impracticable even for gods are obvious and scary for
recollecting them I took shelter in Mt. Rishyamuka. 
"Concluding that the lord of monkeys Vali is an unconquerable, unattackable,
unsympathetic one I am not leaving this Mt. Rishyamuka. 
"I am moving about these forests along with earnest ministers like Hanuma and other
significant ones, only because I am disconcerted and sceptical of him. 
"I chanced upon a laudable and true friend in you, oh, Rama, the patron of friends,
hence I take shelter in you, oh, tiger man, for you are the final resort for those seeking
salvation, like Mt. Himavan. 
"I know the might of that mighty brother-the-malice of mine, and oh, Raghava, but
your valour in combat is imprecise to me." 
"I am neither examining, nor demeaning, nor intimidating you, but his
macabre exploits caused cowardice in me. 
"It is definite, oh, Raghava, your word, courage, and physique denote some sublime
radiance in you, as with ash-covered fire." So said Sugreeva to Rama. 
On hearing that word of great-souled Sugreeva, Rama smilingly replied that the monkey in
his turn. 
"If you are unable to confide in the intrepidity of ours, oh, monkey, I shall
ingrain commendable confidence in you concerning our action." Thus Rama said to Sugreeva.

Saying so to Sugreeva in a comforting manner, he that dextrous, vigorous Rama, the
elder brother of Lakshmana sportively flipped the skeleton of Dundubhi with his big toe, and
flicked that withered body of the demon with his big toe to a ten-yojana distance without
lifting his foot. 
Then on seeing the hurled body, and at valiant Rama who by now is like the
blazing sun, again Sugreeva said this meaningful word to Rama in the presence of Lakshmana and
other monkeys. 
"Oh, friend, at that time when my tired and tipsy brother Vali tossed this body it
was unspoilt, wet with blood and full of flesh. 
"Raghava, now this body is sleazy, without flesh, also rendered into a strawy
condition, and oh, Raghu's delight, you too flipped it because you are now energetic. 
"If it is said something is wet or dried up there chances a lot of difference, oh,
Raghava, thereby it may not be possible to assess whether you might is greater or his, as the
the gravity of the case depends much on that wetness or dryness alone, isn't it."
"That alone is the uncertainty in that matter, sire, whether your strength is
superior or his, and if a single sala tree is ripped in an outright manner the ability or otherwise
will be evident. 
"String the bowstring to this bow of yours, an alternate of elephant's trunk, and
stretch it out up to your ear, and release a great arrow.
"Darted by you your arrow will rip off this sala tree, oh, king, there is no doubt
in that matter, enough is this thinking of yours and you will do me this favour, I pray
and swear upon me." 
"As to how the sun is unsurpassed among all brilliance, as to how Himavan is
unmatched among all mountains, as to how the lion is unequalled among all quadrupeds, so you are
among all men for your unique valour." So said Sugreeva to Rama.On hearing the well-spoken words of Sugreeva that expressed doubt about Rama's
valour, that great resplendent Rama took up a bow to inculcate credence in Sugreeva.
Rama, the bestower of dignity to the sufferers, took up his dreadful bow, aimed at a
sala tree, and darted a single arrow, by which all the directions reverberated with the twang of his
bowstring. 
The golden arrow released by the mighty Rama perforated all the seven sala trees,
and even the levelled areas of the mountain, and then entered the earth. 
Thus that arrow which briskly drilled all the sala trees came up in a moment from
under the earth, and again swiftly re-entered the quiver of Rama. 
On seeing them the seven sala trees that are profoundly fissured, that best monkey
Sugreeva went into a stunning astonishment at the rapidity of Rama's arrow. 
Highly gladdened Sugreeva made a palm fold in that astonishment, kneeled while his
ornaments dangled, and prostrated before Raghava with his head touching the ground. 
Overjoyed with that deed Sugreeva said this to that virtue-knower, the one who is
proficient among all experts of missiles, namely the valorous Rama, who is just in his presence
him. 
"You with your arrows, oh, best one among men, are capable of eliminating all the
gods including Indra, oh, lord, then why to speak of Vali? "By whom seven great sala trees, a mountain and also the earth are ripped off with
only one arrow, oh Kakutstha, who then can stand up to you in the vanguard of war. "Today on gaining a kind-hearted friend like you, who is similar to Indra and
Rain-god who accord favour on their own, my distress is gone and my joy is heightened.

"Oh, Rama, today itself you eliminate that enemy of mine in a brother's semblance
for my happiness, for which I adjoin my palms in supplication." Thus Sugreeva requested Rama.

That great percipient Rama embraced Sugreeva, and Sugreeva is pleasant in his look
for he gained confidence by now, and who is an alternate of Lakshmana to partake Rama's affection,
and then Rama said these words to such a Sugreeva in reply. 
"Let us quickly go from here to Kishkindha, oh, Sugreeva, you move in advance, and
on going there you invite that Vali, one redolent of your brotherhood." So said Rama to Sugreeva.

They all on quickly went to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in the
thickets of forest trees and waited. 
Sugreeva firmly tightened his girdle-cloth for the duel and shouted boisterously to invite Vali for a duel, and his rapidity in shouting appeared as though to crack
the sky.
On hearing his brother's shouting that great mighty Vali is infuriated and
impetuously rushed out of his palace chambers, like the sun falling back onto the sky from his dusking
brink. 
Then a very tumultuous and awful fight occurred between Vali and Sugreeva, which is
like the awful fight between the planets Mercury and Mars in the skies. 
Those two brothers who are convulsed in frenzy battered each other in that fight
with their thunderbolt-like palms, and lightning-like fists. 
Then Rama wielding a bow in his hand watched those valiant ones that were alike in
their appearance, like the Ashwin twins among gods. 
For this reason, Raghava could not differentiate between Sugreeva and Vali, and for the
same reason did not make up his mind to release his arrow, otherwise, it would have been a deadening
arrow, as confusion, is the only reason for Rama. 
Meanwhile, Sugreeva is unable to spot his benefactor Raghava as Vali whacks him
down, and thereby he immediately flees to Mt. Rishyamuka. 
Sugreeva is debilitated and enervated by Vali's thwacking till his limbs are soaked in
blood and he enters the great forest of Rishyamuka as Vali chases him. 
On seeing Sugreeva's entry into the forest of Rishyamuka, Vali said to him "You are
let off for now..." and saying so he returned to Kishkindha from there given fear from the curse
of Sage Matanga. 
Raghava also came to that forest, along with his brother Lakshmana and along with
Hanuma, where that monkey Sugreeva fled. 
Seeing the arrival of Rama with Lakshmana, Sugreeva ashamedly turned his eyes down
to earth and piteously spoke this without eyeing Rama 
"Showing your dexterity you encouraged me to invite Vali for a fight, but you got me
battered by my enemy, what is this done by you."
"You should have truly made it known at that time only, oh, Raghava, that you will
not kill Vali, then I would not have come here, to Kishkindha.
Rama replied that great-souled Sugreeva was speaking woefully with pathetic words
in this way. 
"Sugreeva, by which reason I have not let off an arrow such as that of mine, that
reason may be heard and let the anger be discarded. 
"By ornamentation, attire, physicality and movements, you and Vali look-alike.

"By your voice, bodily glow also thus in your looking, also in bravery and 
speech, oh monkey, I could not mark any difference. 
"Thereby, oh, great monkey, I have not released this great speeded and enemy-annihilating arrow of mine as I was confused by the similarity of your personalities. [4-12-32]
"I was ambiguous by your similarities, as such I have not released this ghastly and
life-taking arrow, otherwise a basic object of ours will be ruined, won't it? 
"When my unawareness and fallacy hazardously afflicts none but you in the form of my
arrow, oh, brave lord of monkeys, then I will be establishing my imbecility and naivety,
isn't it?
"Eliminating one who is protected means a terrifying sin of the highest order, even so,
myself and Lakshmana and also thus Seetha with her exquisite glow are all dependent on you, and you
are our shelterer in this forest? 
"Therefore, oh, monkey, again you fight with him without doubting me, and I will
render him ineffective at this moment only with a single arrow of mine, and you can see Vali
squirming on the ground. ,
"You have an identification for yourself, oh lord of monkeys, by which you can be
identified when you are engaged in a duel. 
"Lakshmana, pick up this gaja creeper that is beautiful in its appearance and let
this noble souled Sugreeva be garlanded with that." So said Rama to Lakshmana. 
Then Lakshmana plucked that gaja creeper with flowers growing at the foot of the
mountain and slung it like a garland around the neck of that Sugreeva. [4-12-40] n
He that prosperous Sugreeva with that flowery creeper adorning his neck then shone
forth like a black rain cloud against a backdrop of rich ochry colour of sunset, and with a train
of herons adorning that cloud like a garland. 
He that Sugreeva whose physique became effulgent by that creeper-garland is again
emboldened by Rama's words, and he again advanced to Kishkindha with Rama and reached it again.
Hanuma, the son of Vayu, saw a best tall building and the wide one in the middle of
that best group of houses.
That building of Ravana filled with many edifices was half a Yojana long and one
Yojana is tall.
Hanuma, the destructor of enemies, moved around in all directions searching for
Seetha the wide-eyed daughter of the King of Videha
Thereafter, Hanuma the glorious one neared and observed the best residence of
Rakshasas and the house of Ravana, containing elephants with four tusks and also those with three
tusks, those with two tusks and still not crowded. It was protected by soldiers bearing raised
weapons.
That building was surrounded by the wives of Ravana, demonesses, and princesses
brought by strength, was like an ocean filled with crocodiles, big fishes, sharks and other fishes,
moved by the speed of the wind, and together with serpents.
Whatever wealth is at Kubera, whatever riches at Indra with green horses, all that
affluence was at Ravana's house. That wealth was always without reduction.
Whatever was the fortune of Kubera the King of Yakshas, of Yama and Varuna, the
same fortune or even greater treasure was at this house of Ravana.
Hanuma saw another house in the middle of that house, a well-built one consisting of
many elephants in a rut.
Whatever wonderful aeroplane by the name of Pushpaka, decorated with all kinds of
precious stones, made by Visvakarma in heaven for lord Brahma, whatever plane Kubera obtained by
great austerity from Lord Brahma, Ravana obtained that plane by prowess defeating Kubera.
Supported by pillars decorated with images of wolves, with silver and golden hues and
which were well made, radiant with splendour, decorated all around with rooms equalling Mount Meru
and Mount Mandara, as though touching the sky with an auspicious shape.
Well made by Visvakarma and resembling Fire and Sun in splendour, with stairways
made of gold and with beautiful and best platforms;
With windows and ventilation holes made of gold and also made of crystal, with
platforms made of sapphires and emeralds;
Shone by floors embellished with corals of strange hue and with precious stones of
great value, with pearls without comparison;
Reddish and resembling gold, together with sandalwood having a good smell and
brilliant like the Sun at noon;
The great Hanuma alighted the best aeroplane called Pushpaka with an excellent form
decorated by rows of upper floors.
That Hanuma then being there, smelled a wonderful sweet fragrance like wind with an
appearance, created from drinks and foods, including cooked rice diffused on all sides.
That sweet smell was as though saying thus to that Hanuma: "Come here!", like a
relative to a best relative pointing to there wherever that Ravana was.
Hanuma started thereafter there (in that direction) and saw an auspicious great
hall, close to the heart of Ravana, like a delightful best woman.
That hall was made of stairways embedded with diamonds, decorated with golden
windows, with a floor embellished with crystal, with shapes made from ivory in the middle.
Well decorated with pearls, and corals and also with silver and gold and diamond
studded pillars and decorated with many pillars.
By pillars slightly bent with no distortion, which were very tall and well-decorated
all over, that hall was as though starting for the sky with very high wings.
Covered by a wonderful large carpet with all the earth's characteristics like rivers,
mountains, oceans, forests, painted over, that hall was like the vast earth together with states
and rows of houses.
It was resounded by birds in heat, made fragrant by excellent perfumes, hung with
the best tapestries and inhabited by the king of rakshasas
It was made smokey by the fumes of agallocum. It was pure white like a swan,
wonderful by the decoration of flowers, like a divine cow with a great radiance.
That excellent hall was causing happiness to heart, causing a fair complexion,
destroying sorrow and was as though producing prosperity.
Like a mother, then that hall governed by Ravana caused satisfaction to all five
sensory organs with all the excellent five objects of the senses.
Hanuma thought thus: "This is heaven! This is indeed the abode of Devas! This is the
city of Indra. This might be the result of a great austerity."
Like gamblers defeated by greater gamblers in gambling, Hanuma saw golden-hued lamps
being still, as though in thought.
Hanuma thought thus: "This building shines by the light of lamps and the brilliance
of Ravana and also due to the radiance of jewellery."
Thereafter Hanuma saw a thousand of the best women sitting on the rug with clothing of
various colours and decorated in a variety of ways.
Then at the turn of midnight, those women slept deeply resting after playing during
night, with a deep sleep caused by liquor.
That sleeping group of women, adorned with jewels which were not making sound, shone
like a great park of lotuses with calm swans and bees.
Hanuma saw the faces of those best women, with teeth covered by lips with closed eyes
and with lotus fragrance.
At that time, those faces shone which became like lotuses in blossom during the daytime
and again were like lotuses with closed petals at night.
Hanuma thought that drunk bees are desiring, again and again, this lotus
faces like lotuses in blossom.
The glorious great Hanuma thought as above by recourse to reason. He also thought
thus "Those faces equal lotuses by their qualities such as beauty, fragrance, and others".
That hall of Ravana's being shone by those women, glittered like a calm cloudless
sky in autumn shone by stars.
That lord of Rakshasas surrounded by those women shone like the radiant moon
surrounded by stars.
Then Hanuma thought thus: "Whatever meteors together with the residue of piety fall
down from the sky, all those meteors had been together as these women".
There the luster, complexion and grace of those women resembled great stars
which emitted an auspicious radiance.
Those women with dishevelled large thick garlands and scattered excellent jewels
during the time of drinking, dancing etc., were with consciousness stolen by sleep.
Best women with disturbed sacred marks (tilaka) on foreheads became displaced
anklets, became with necklaces fallen off to the side.
Some other women became tied with pearl necklaces, some others became with tied up
waist ornaments (and) resembled young female horses who had walked long.
Some others wearing nice earrings with flower garlands that were torn and disturbed,
resembled creepers, tread upon by an elephant in a big forest.
Big pearl necklaces with the radiance of moon rays in the middle of the breasts of some
other women shone like sleeping swans.
And of some other women, necklaces made with cat's eye gems resembled birds called
Kadambas and for some others golden chains were like Chakravaka birds.
Those women with buttocks resembling dunes, shone like rivers filled with swans
and birds called Karandas and decorated by Chakravaka birds.
Those sleeping women shone like rivers with their smiles as flower buds, with golden
jewellery as big lotuses, with their behaviours as crocodiles, with fame as banks.
Auspicious lines of decoration which were on smooth parts of some other women and 
nipples, were like jewellery.
Edges of clothing (worn by them) disturbed by air from the breathing of some other
women were being fluttered again and again on their faces.
Those edges of clothes with various beautiful colours shone at the base of Ravana's
wives' throats like hoisted flags of beautiful shine.
Here ear-rings of some beautiful women with a good glory also moved lightly due to
the air from the breathing of those women.
Then comforting breath from the faces of those women, by nature fragrant with the
the smell of liquor made of Sarkara served Ravana.
Some women of Ravana smelled co-wives' faces again and again imagining them to be
face of Ravana.
Those best women with greatly devoted minds in Ravana, then not being on own will,
brought delight only to their co-wives.
Some other women slept there, making as pillows their arms decorated with bracelets
and beautiful clothes.
Another woman slept on another's bosom, again another woman slept on her shoulder,
another woman slept on another woman's thigh and another slept on her breasts.
Overcome with heat and friendship, they resorted to thighs, sides, waist and back of
one another, with mutual limbs placed on one another.
That garland of women tied with the rope of each other's shoulders shone like a
flower garland with dragonflies on it tied in thread.
That group of women of Ravana, tied by each other as garland with a mixed group of
flowers, with beautiful shoulders, entwined promiscuously, hair like an exalted garden with a flower
garland tied together of creepers in bloom due to the caress of the lord of wind in the vernal in
the month of Vaisakha, with entwined beautiful trees.
Then it was not possible to make clear the knowledge of jewellery, body parts and
clothes of those women even for those used to them.
While Ravana slept comfortably, golden lamps shining brilliantly, were as though
seeing without closing their eyes, those women of various glows.
Women of royal sages, Brahmanas and demons and of Gandharvas, of Rakshasas - all
those unmarried girls surrendered from lust to Ravana.
All those women had been stolen by Ravana with a desire for war, some together with
the heat of youth obtained Ravana being desired by the god of love.
There, even one woman had not been obtained forcefully by the strong Ravana, except
for that daughter of Janaka, Seetha. Every other woman had been obtained by her character alone and
no woman had desire in another man, and there also was none with another lover.
And there was no wife of his without a good lineage, there was no one with less
beauty, no one without skill, no one without service, none with low intellect, no one without
causing desire to lover.
The following thought occurred to Hanuma with a pious mind: "It would have been good
for this Ravana if the virtuous wife of Rama had been left happy with her husband in the same such
manner as these wives of the king of rakshasas."
Hanuma became gloomy and thought thus: "Seetha is the best by virtues;
then this lord of Lanka even though being great otherwise, did an evil and an un-gentlemanly deed
with her.
Thus, this is the th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.Thereafter, early in the morning on the fourteenth day, the king-makers coming
together, spoke to Bharata the following words.
"Dasaratha, who was our highly venerable master, went to heaven after sending his
elder son Rama and the exceedingly strong Lakshmana to forest."
"O, the highly illustrious prince! From now on, do you be our king. Fortunately,
this kingdom has not yet missed the mark, even without a king."
"O, prince Bharata! Taking all the things needed for coronation, your own people
(the counsellers and the ministers) as well as the citizens are awaiting for you."
"O, Bharata the excellent among men! Take over the stable kingdom, which came in
succession from your ancestors, coronate yourself and rule us."
The firmly resolute Bharata performed circumambulation clockwise around all the
things kept ready for consecration and replied to all those people as follows:
"It is indeed appropriate to bestow kingship always to the eldest of our clan. You, being the conversant people, ought not to tell in this manner to me."
"Our eldest brother, Rama will become the king. I then will reside in the forest for fourteen years."
"Let a great and exceptionally powerful army consisting of all the four limbs be
kept ready. I shall bring Rama our elder brother from the forest."
"Keeping in front, all the assembled requisites needed for consecration, I shall
proceed to the forest for the sake of bringing back Rama."
"Consecrating him, the tiger among men there itself, I shall surely bring Rama
solemnized in front, as bringing home the sacred fire from a sacrificial rite, after performing it outside the city."
"I shall not make her, my so-called mother, fulfil her desire. I will reside in the impassable forest. Rama will become the king."
"Let a path-way be prepared by those skilled in that profession, by leveling the
uneven surfaces. Let guards who can easily move in the inaccessible forests accompany us in the path."
Hearing Prince Bharata, talking in consideration of Rama's cause, all the people
replied in the following illustrious and excellent words:
"Let the gracious goddess of prosperity abide with you, who are speaking thus,
desirous of giving kingdom to Rama the eldest son of the king."
Hearing those excellent words spoken by the prince close to their ears, tears born of joy fell from the face and eyes of those venerable men.
Hearing these words, the people there along with council and the ministers felt
cheerful, being relieved of their anxiety and spoke the following words : "As per your command, devoted men and a group of artisans have been instructed to make the path-way."When those two, Vishvamitra and Sumati, have met one another there at that place, 
king Sumati raised the topic of Rama and Lakshmana, after exchanging greetings and 
enquiring about the well-being of the great-saint Vishvamitra. 
"These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious 
elephants and arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine 
bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching 
that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness 
in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals 
have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have 
come here, and whose scions are they? 
"These two best ones among men are identical to one another by their bodily proportion, 
facial-language, and by bodily gestures, and with their presence they refurbish 
this province like the Moon and Sun brightening the firmament. In truth, I would 
like to know for what reason these valiant ones who are wielding best weapons have 
arrived here travelling on an arduous path." Thus, king Sumati asked Vishvamitra. 

On hearing those words of King Sumati, Vishvamitra informed him about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, also about the elimination 
of demons, as it has happened. 
King Sumati is highly astonished to hear the words of Vishvamitra about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana, and treating them to have come as the most prominent and 
honour-worthy guests that king started to honour those two great-mighty sons of 
Dasharatha customarily. 
On getting high honours from King Sumati, Raghava-s stayed there along with Vishvamitra 
and with the community of sages for one night, and then they all have moved on to 
Mithila. 
On seeing Janaka's auspicious city Mithila, all of the saints who are accompanying 
Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana, extolled it saying, "Splendid! Splendid!" and 
admired it highly. 
On seeing a hermitage in the fringes of Mithila, that appeared to be age-old, but 
now uninhabited, yet pleasing, Rama asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. 
"This is semblable to a hermitage but sages seem to have discarded it. Oh, venerable 
sage, whose is this hermitage previously, I wish to listen of it." Thus, Rama asked 
Vishvamitra. 
On hearing that sentence spoken by Raghava, the expert in sententiousness, a great 
resplendent sage and eminent-saint Vishvamitra replied him in this way. 
What a pleasure! You may listen as I narrate, Raghava, whose hermitage is this 
factually, and which great soul has resentfully cursed this. 
Oh, the best one among men Rama, this hermitage with a heavenly glisten, and highly 
hallowed even by gods, once belonged to the great-souled sage Gautama. 
In this hermitage, oh, prince Rama, once that highly renowned Sage Gautama sat 
tight in asceticism for numerous cycle of years along with his wife Ahalya. 
On knowing the meantime of Gautama's availability at hermitage, Indra, the husband 
of Shaci Devi and the Thousand-eyed god wearing the guise of sage Gautama and becoming 
such a sage, approached Ahalya and said this to her. 
Oh, finely limbed lady, indulgers do not watch out for the time to conceive, 
as such oh, slender-waisted one, I desire copulation with you. 
Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, though knowing him as the Thousand-eyed Indra in 
the guise of her husband Gautama, she is inclined to have intercourse ill-advisedly, 
only to satisfy the impassion of the King of Gods. 
She felt fulfilled in her heart of hearts and then she said this to that best god 
Indra, 'I am gratified in complying with your wish, oh, best of gods, get going 
oh, lord, from here quickly, oh, ruler of gods, always safeguard yourself and me 
from Sage Gautama.' Thus, Ahalya said to Indra. 
Indra on his part smilingly said this word to Ahalya, 'oh, well-hipped lady, I 
am quite delighted, here I go as I have came.' 
Oh, Rama, Indra then came out of the cottage flustering hurriedly after copulating 
with her with an uncertainty about the arrival of Sage Gautama. 
Indra looked at Gautama..the one who is great saint, inaccessible to gods and demons, full of ascetic power,
purified with holy water, bright like fire, holding Samidha-s and kusha grass in hands,
and eminent Sage entering into the hermitage. 
On seeing the sage the lord of gods Indra is scared and became dreary-faced. Then 
the well-behaved Gautama furiously spoke these words on seeing the ill-behaved Thousand-eyed 
Indra who is donning the guise of a saint. 
'Oh, dirty-minded Indra, taking hold of my form you have effectuated this unacceptable 
deed, whereby you shall become infecund.' Thus, Gautama cursed Indra. 
When that great-souled sage Gautama spoke that way with rancour, the testicles 
of the cursed Thousand-eyed Indra fell down onto ground at that very moment. 
On cursing Indra thus the sage cursed even his wife saying, 'you shall tarry here 
for many thousands of years to come without food and consuming air alone, and unseen 
by all beings you shall live on in this hermitage while contritely recumbent in 
dust.' 
When that unassailable son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, arrives at this squalid 
forest, for it will be henceforth rendered so along with you, then you will be purified. 

'On your welcoming Rama, oh, ill-behaved woman, you will be divested of your greed 
and craze in which you lingered so far, and then you will assume your own body and 
then you can be in my proximity, rejoicingly.' Thus, Sage Gautama cursed his wife 
Ahalya. 
"On cursing immodest Ahalya thus, that great-resplendent Sage Gautama shed this 
hermitage which was once adored by celestials like siddha-sand caarana-s, and that 
great-ascetic Gautama practised his asceticism on the pleasant peaks of Himalayas." 
Thus, Vishvamitra continued his narration about the legend of Ahalya. Thus, Hanuma on saying therein again spoke to that most reverential
and sainted lady who is dressed in black deerskin and conducting herself in probity. 
"Overtired with hunger and thirst we have overawed anywise, and we suddenly entered
this cavity, which is overspread with darkness..."  
"We entered this extensive hollow of earth thirstily, but on seeing this kind of
these diverse and marvellous mansions we are verily amazed [presuming that this is a dominion of
some demon,] and we are agitated  and agonised [at our
incarceration...] whose trees are all these golden ones, splendent like the young sun... [--,
]
"The edibles, tubers, and fruits are all depurated... golden are the aircraft...
mansions silvern... ventilators golden and encased in jewellery laces... 
"Flowered and fruited and also aromatically scented are these auspicious and
completely golden trees... by whose splendour  
"Also how the lotuses born in limpid water are golden, and how the fishes along with
tortoises are ostensibly golden? 
"Or, is all this owing to the innate prodigy of yours or to whose ascesis' prowess
all this is owed... as all of us are oblivious of it, so it will be apt of you to narrate all of
it..."  
Thus when Hanuma addressed her, that sainted lady, and a blissful one in the well
being of all the beings, she replied Hanuma. 
"A marvellous fantasist by the name of Maya was there, a bullish demon of wizardry and by
him with his phenomenal expertise all this golden woodland is constructed..." [Thus, that sainted
the lady started her narration.] 
"Once he was the Universal Craftsman to the lords of demons by whom this divinely
the golden and superb mansion was constructed... 
"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,
obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, the entire wealth of Sage
Shukra...
"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,
obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, the entire wealth of those
people, who immoderately and avariciously beseech all the available gods, to accord all wealth to
them only...
"That dynamic one methodised everything and then resided comfortably in this great
Forest for some time, privileged with all his wishes... 
"Indra, the Administrator of Worlds and destroyer of enemy citadels, on taking His
Thunderbolt eliminated Maya when that eminent demon was engaged with an apsara, a paradisiacal
nymph, called Hema... 
"This marvellous woodland, these everlasting wish-fulfillers, and this golden
the mansion is benefited by Brahma for Hema... 
"I am the daughter of Merusaavarni, oh, best monkey, named Swayamprabha and I am
safeguarding this mansion of her,  Hema... 
"Hema is a virtuoso in dance and music and my dearest nymphean-friend, and she
bestowed a boon upon me  I am safeguarding this superb
mansion... 
"What is your effort or for what reason you came to pass this impervious forest, and
how you all have discovered this impassable forest... 
"Dine on these wholesome edibles, fruits and tubers, also on drinking soft drinks,
it is apt of you to inform me all about [your mission..." Thus Swayamprabha gave hospitality to the
monkeys.] On listening the narration of Sage Vishwamitra about Ganga's descent along with 
Lakshmana, Rama went into a great astonishment, and then addressed Vishvamitra. 

The blessed legend you have narrated about the digging of an ocean at the behest 
of Sagara, Ganga's alighting, and Bhageeratha filling it with the water of Ganga 
is sacrosanct and even highly amazing. 
Oh, enemy-inflamer, for two of us entire night rolled by as if it is a single moment 
while we were thinking about the episode you have narrated in its entirety. 
While thinking about the auspicious legend of Ganga along with Lakshmana, oh, friend 
of the universe, Vishvamitra, whole night rolled by." Thus Rama is addressing Vishvamitra. 

Thereafter on the next fresh dawn the enemy-oppressor Raghava spoke these words 
to sage Vishvamitra, whose affluence is nothing but asceticism, and who by now has 
performed his daily chores of rituals. 
We have listened the praiseworthy legend of River Ganga, and the deific night 
has also passed by while listening such a legend, we may now cross over the very 
same prominent and merited River Ganga, the tri-path-cruiser. 
"This boat which is suitable for the embarkation of the sages whose deeds are pious, 
and which is comfortably blanketed with mats in its deck has come here, and indeed 
on knowing about the visit of your holiness to this place the sages have fetched 
it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. 
Hearing the words of great-souled Raghava, Vishvamitra of Kusha dynasty, started 
to cross over the River Ganga along with the assemblage of sages, and with both 
the Raghava-s. 
Arriving at the northern bank of River Ganga they have honoured the group of sages 
who ferried them up to here and sent them off. Then sojourning on the riverbank 
of Ganga they have seen the city called Vishaala. 
The great sage Vishvamitra then quickly started along with Rama and Lakshmana to 
the charming and admirable city Vishaala, which in comparison is like heaven. 
Then Rama, whose flair for knowing everything is high, became suppliant duly adjoining 
his palms, and enquired about the prominent city Vishala with the great Sage Vishvamitra. 

"Oh, great sage, which dynasty of kings is ruling from this city of Vishaala? Let 
safeness betide you, I am interested to hear of it and indeed I am highly inquisitive 
about it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. 
Hearing that sentence of Rama then the eminent sage Vishvamitra has commenced to 
narrate the legend of ancient Vishaala. 
Oh, Rama, I will tell you about the auspicious legend of Indra as I was told, and 
you listen to it as I tell. Oh, Raghava, indeed you may now listen to the quintessence 
of what has happened in this country. 
Once in Krita era, oh, Rama, the sons of Lady Diti were extremely energetic, whereas 
the sons of her younger sister Lady Aditi were vigorous and highly righteous. 
"Oh, tigerly-man, Rama, then those great-souls speculated as to 'how we can thrive 
without ageing, illness, and likewise without death.' 
A thought occurred to those masterminds who were thinking on that matter clueing 
them up, 'we indeed can get elixir of life by churning the Milky Ocean.' 
Deciding upon to churn the Milky Ocean then made Vasuki, Thousand-headed King of 
Snakes, as the churning rope and Mt. Mandara as stirrer, and those brothers whose 
energy is unlimited have started churning the Milky Ocean thoroughly. 
After a thousand years, the Thousand-headed serpent Vaasuki, which is being 
used as churning rope, is incapacitated to bear the friction of churning and fanged 
the cliffs of Mt. Mandara. Thereby a great lot of venom is disgorged from the heads 
of that serpent Vaasuki, which venom on melting the rocks of Mt. Mandara became 
the holocaustic poison calledhaalaahala. 
A lethal poison similar to inferno known ashaalaahalahas started to fulminate 
therefrom, by which whole universe of gods, non-gods and humans is burnt down. 
The gods seeking shelter then approached Rudra, the Cardinal God, Endower of Solace, 
and who husbands all the created animals inclusive of human-animals, namely Shiva, 
and they prayed to him saying 'save, save us.' 
This way while the gods are praying the Lord and God of Gods, namely Shiva, then 
handling his disc and conch-shell Vishnu has also revealed himself at that place. 

And Vishnu smilingly spoke to wielder of trident Rudra, 'oh, god the best, whatever 
element that has emerged from the churning of Milk Ocean by gods, that shall belong 
to you, isn't it. By virtue of your position as the foremost god among gods, oh, 
omnicompetent god Shiva, you please accept this poison applying yourself to that 
position of foremost god, and deeming this poison, haalahala, as a foremost oblation 
to your godhood'. 
Saying so Vishnu, the best one among gods, has disappeared then and there only. 
And on observing the scare of gods and also on paying heed to the words of the Wielder 
of Bow calledshaar~Nga, namely Vishnu, god Shiva gulped that lethal poison,haalaahala, as if it is ambrosia. 
The god of gods Hara then left for his abode Kailash parting with other gods, and 
oh, Rama, the joy of Raghu's dynasty, the gods and non-gods have continued to churn 
the Milky Ocean. 
Now the loftiest mountain that is being used as stirrer, namely Mt. Mandara, has 
caved into the netherworld, thereby the gods along with gandharva-s have prayed 
to Madhusuudana, the other name of Vishnu. 
'You alone are the recourse to all beings, especially to the dwellers in heavens, 
oh ambidextrous god Vishnu, you safeguard us, it will be apt of you elevate the 
mountain.' So prayed gods to Vishnu. 
Hearing the prayer of gods Vishnu, Hrisheekesha, the controller of senses, adopting 
the form of a tortoise and positioning the stirring Mt. Mandara on that tortoiseshell, 
he lay recumbent at the bottom of Milky Ocean as a base to the stirrer. 
Keshava then reached out his hand and grasped the mountaintop as he is the Cosmic-Soul, 
and thus staying amid gods that Supreme Person Vishnu participated in churning the 
ocean by holding the stirring mountain upright. 
After a thousand years of churning, then a male personality, an epitome of Life 
Sciences, namelyaayurveda, a highly righteous soul, named Dhanvantari, 
has firstly surfaced with his arm-rest-stick and with his handy water-vessel, and 
then the remarkably elegant Apsara-s, angelic damsels, have emerged next to him 
from the Milky Ocean. 
Choicest females have come out an elixir obtained on absolute churning of the waters 
of Milk Ocean, oh, best one among men, Rama, thereby that genera of females became 
Apsara-s. 
Six hundred millions of such Apsara-s with amazing dazzle have emerged from the 
churning of Milky Ocean, oh, descendent of Kakutstha, and their maidservants who 
emerged along with them are innumerable. 
Anybody either from gods or demons espoused them, and when none espoused them they 
are virtually reckoned as 'general-purpose' Apsara-females. 
Oh, descendent of Raghu, then the heaven-sent damsel Vaaruni came up from Milky 
Ocean searching for her espousal, who is the daughter of Varuna, the Rain-god, and 
who incidentally is the presiding deity of hard liquors and also called assura. 

Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of 
Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have 
espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. 
Thereby the sons of Diti are calledasuraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are 
calledsuraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni. 

Then a best horse called Ucchaishravaa has emerged, oh, Rama, the best among men, 
and then a gem of a jewel, called Kaustubha, and like thatamrita, the 
Supreme ambrosial elixir of gods, have also emerged. 
Owing to the dispute regarding the possession of that ambrosia, oh, Rama, then 
there chanced a rampant ethnic havoc, and then the sons of Aditi have havocked the 
sons of Diti. 
All the asura-s and demons have come to one side against sura-s, and there occurred 
a very gruesome war which was perplexing to all the triad of universe viz., ethereal, 
real and surreal spheres. 
When everything is wading into annihilation then that omnicompetent Vishnu swiftly 
impounded Amrita, the Divine Elixir, by assuming his illusory power of Mohini. 
Whoever confronted that Eternal and Supreme Person, namely Vishnu, in that war, 
then Vishnu whose blaze is threefold as manifest in the sun, fire and lightning, 
has pulverised him. 
In this horrendous war between the progeny of Diti, namely demons, and the progeny 
of Aditi, namely gods, the sons of Aditi being gods, have altogether massacred the 
demonic sons of Diti. 
"On eliminating the demonic sons of Diti and on acquiring kingdom of heaven, that 
eliminator of enemy cities, namely Indra, happily ruled the worlds that are inclusive 
of sages and caarana-s." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Vishaala 
city and its emergence. On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the tigerly man Rama 
replied him with estimable words. 
"It is said that yaksha's strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how 
then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants? 
On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence 
to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, 
"Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the 
bestowal of a boon. 
"Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout 
conduct performed a great ascesis. 
"Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who 
is renowned by the name of Tataka. 
"Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly 
remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous. 

"When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to 
Jambha's son Sunda as wife. 
"Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who 
by curse became a demon. 
"But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya's curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate 
that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha. 
"With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him 
away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya 
firstly cursed Mareecha saying, 'you will attain demon-hood.' 
"Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, 'forthwith divested of this form 
of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, 
face contorted, and shape monstrous.' 
"Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious 
province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered. 
"She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall 
eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows. 
"Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, 
Raghu's legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her. 
"Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since 
a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society. 
"For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either 
it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying. 
"To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, 
the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn't it. 

"Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the 
daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven't we. 
"And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya's mother 
when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra. 
"Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females 
who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, 
by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her." Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama 
regarding Tataka's elimination. On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the tigerly man Rama 
replied him with estimable words. 
"It is said that yaksha's strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how 
then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants? 
On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence 
to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, 
"Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the 
bestowal of a boon. 
"Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout 
conduct performed a great ascesis. 
"Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who 
is renowned by the name of Tataka. 
"Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly 
remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous. 

"When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to 
Jambha's son Sunda as wife. 
"Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who 
by curse became a demon. 
"But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya's curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate 
that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha. 
"With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him 
away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya 
firstly cursed Mareecha saying, 'you will attain demon-hood.' 
"Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, 'forthwith divested of this form 
of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, 
face contorted, and shape monstrous.' 
"Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious 
province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered. 
"She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall 
eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows. 
"Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, 
Raghu's legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her. 
"Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since 
a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society. 
"For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either 
it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying. 
"To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, 
the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn't it. 

"Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the 
daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven't we. 
"And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya's mother 
when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra. 
"Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females 
who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, 
by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her." Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama 
regarding Tataka's elimination. "Diti was highly anguished when her foetus is rendered into sevenfold, and spoke these 
appeasing words to the indomitable Thousand-eyed Indra." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
City Vishala. 
'Oh, Indra, the eliminator of demon Bala, this foetus of mine is sliced into seven 
segments owing to my own misdeed, oh, ruler of gods, Indra, indeed there is no iniquity of yours in 
this matter.' Thus Diti started speaking to Indra. 
Though a reversal has happened against my thinking in the matter of my pregnancy, 
let these seven segments become your seven Wind-gods, the rulers of seven ethereal-places, under your 
ruler-ship. 
Oh, son Indra, let these seven sons of mine become the seven presiding deities of 
Cosmic Air Divisions and let them move in heaven with heavenly forms. 
One from the seven may permeate Brahma's abode, likewise another may permeate the 
heaven of Indra, and even the third one, let him become a greatly celebrated and reputed as Divine Wind, 
and he may circulate in entire universe. 
'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, let four of my sons permeate four directions according to 
time and at your command, let safety betide you, and let them be renowned verily by the name given by 
you as 'Marut,' because you have coaxed the crying fragments of foetus saying, 'maa ruda, maa ruda, 
'do not cry, do not cry...' Thus Diti said to Indra. 
On hearing her words, the Thousand-eyed destroyer of enemy's citadels and a demon named 
Bala, namely Indra, spoke this word to Diti, humbly adjoining his palms. 
" 'All this will happen as you have said, undoubtedly, and your offspring, the Maaruta-s, 
would be pervading in the forms of gods, you be safe.' Thus Indra assured Diti. Those two, the stepmother 
Diti and the stepson Indra, on arriving at a decision in that ascetic forest, departed to heaven fulfilling 
their purposes. Thus we heard the legend." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. 
Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, this province is that one which was once presided over by Indra, 
and where he rendered services to that accomplished one in her asceticism, namely lady Diti. 
To king Ikshvaku of Vishaala, oh, tigerly-man Rama, a highly righteous son was born 
through queen Alambusa, and he was renowned as Vishaala. There is a city in this place constructed by 
him and known by his own name, Vishaala. 
"Oh, Rama, Vishaala's son is the great-mighty Hemachandra, and Hemachandra's son is highly 
renowned as Suchandra.. 
"The son of Suchandra became famous as Dhuumraashva, and oh, Rama, Dhuumraashva derived 
his son named Srinjaya. 
The fortunate and valorous son of Srinjaya is Sahadeva, and the son of Sahadeva is the 
most righteous Kushaashva. 
The highly resplendent and dauntless Somadatta is the son of Kushaashva and Somadatta's 
son is highly reputed as Kakutstha. 
Presently that Kakutstha's son named Sumati, who is a great-resplendent one, an unconquerable 
one, and a highly celebrated one is dwelling in this city. 
By the grace of Ikshvaku, the successive kings of Vishaala have longevity, intrepidity, 
well-off in generosity, and they were great-souled ones. 
"Today we may gladly go to sleep here for a night, and oh, best one among men, and it 
will be apt of you to see Janaka, the King of Mithila tomorrow morning." Thus Sage Vishvamitra spoke 
to Rama and Lakshmana. 
The best one among best men, a widely reputed and the highly resplendent king of Vishaala, 
namely Sumati, having heard that Vishvamitra has arrived at the precincts of the city, came to him for 
a warm welcome. 
King Sumati arrived along with his mentors and family members, offered an excellent veneration 
to Vishvamitra, and then spoke to the sage with adjoined palms enquiring about his well being. 
"To which province you have visited that happens to be mine, thereby I could get an audience 
of yours without stirring myself from my country, hence none will be more fortunate than me." So said 
king Sumati to Vishvamitra. "Oh, Raghava, on making that great-souled Vashishta an enemy, whenever Vishvamitra 
reminisced over his subdual by Vashishta, he is seethed at heart and heaved sighs 
repeatedly. Then on going to southern quarter with his prime queen, that great-ascetic 
Vishvamitra self-collectedly conducted a highly astounding ascesis subsisting only 
on fruits and tubers." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's 
legend. 
Then Vishvamitra begot sons named Havispanda, Madhuspnada, Dhridhanetra and Mahaaratha, 
who conduct themselves in candour and chivalry. 
At the close of one thousand years of ascesis Brahma, the Grandparent of all worlds, 
revealed Himself to Vishvamitra and spoke these words mellowly to ascetically wealthy 
Vishvamitra, 'oh, son of Kushika, Vishvamitra, you have won the worlds of kingly-sages 
by your ascesis.' 
'We indeed acquiesce you as a kingly-sage by your ascesis.' saying so that great 
resplendent Brahma, the Supreme Ruler of the Worlds, went away to his Abode of Brahma, 
while the gods in Brahma's convoy went to Indra's Heaven. 
On hearing that Vishvamitra is down-faced with disgrace, and while high anguish 
prevailed over him, he rancorously soliloquised this. 
'Even though I have practised a very high ascesis, the gods together with the 
observances of hermits are recognising me just as a 'kingly-sage.' Thereby I deem 
that there is no fruition to my ascesis.' Thus Vishvamitra thought. 
Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, deciding in this way in his heart of hearts that self-willed 
Vishvamitra again undertook a supreme ascesis as he is a great-ascetic. 
In this meantime there is a veracious king named Trishanku, an enhancer of 
Ikshvaku dynasty, and one renowned for his self-conquest. 
Oh, Raghava, an idea sprang up in the mind of Trishanku to perform a ritual 
by which he will go to heaven with his own body. Then he sincerely invited Vashishta 
and told him what his thinking is. 
But the great-souled Vashishta said it as impossible. Thus repudiated Trishanku 
went to southerly direction in search of orchestrators for the purpose of realising 
that task, such a phantasmal ritual that enables him to go to heaven with his body, 
and that king has gone to the sons of Vashishta. 
Trishanku has indeed gone to the place where the sons of Vashishta are protractedly 
expiating, and there he visited the hundred noble-souled sons of Vashishta, who 
are supremely self-luminescent and superbly self-refulgent by their ascesis. 
On reaching nigh of those noble-souled sons of the indoctrinator, namely Vashishta, 
Trishanku reverenced all of them sequentially according to their age, but with a 
little down- faced owing to abashment, and spoke to all of those great-souled ones 
making palm-fold in supplication. 
I have come as a shelter-seeker seeking the shelter of yours as you are the shelterers 
of the needy, you all be safe, as the great-souled Vashishta has repudiated me. 

I am longing to perform an unusual ritual and it will be apt of you to give assent 
to it. Reverencing all of the sons of my mentor Vashishta I am proposing this to 
you. 
With reverence I truckle before you all Brahmans who are abiding in ascesis. 
Such as you are I beg you to assiduously get a ritual performed through me, as to 
how I can get to heaven with my body. 
Oh, ascetically wealthy Brahmans, as I am repudiated by Vashishta, I do not perceive 
another recourse excepting you, who are all the sons of mentor Vashishta. 
" 'The Priest is the ultimate recourse for all of the kings in Ikshvaku dynasty, 
isn't it. Therefore, next to Vashishta you are all the next-best gods to me.' Thus 
Trishanku entreated the hundred sons of Sage Vashishta." Sage Shataananda thus continued 
narration. On hearing that sentence of that intellectual sage Vishvamitra, the highly refulgent 
and the great ascetic Shataananda is overjoyed, and Sage Shataananda, the eldest 
son of Sage Gautama, and whose radiance is brightened by his own ascesis is highly 
amazed just on seeing Rama. 
On raptly observing those two princes who are sitting comfortably with their heads 
bending down submissively, then Shataananda spoke to the eminent sage Vishvamitra. 

Oh, tigerly saint Vishvamitra, you have revealed my glorious mother Ahalya who 
meted out a marathon ascesis to the princes - Really! 
And the highly resplendent and celebrated mother of mine worshipped Rama, who is 
worthy of worship by every corporeal being, with forest produce, is it so! 
Oh, great-resplendent Vishvamitra, you have narrated to Rama about the maltreatment 
of my mother by the Providence as has happened anciently, isn't it!
Oh, the best sage Kaushika, you be safe, my mother is reunited with my father on 
beholding and giving hospitality to Rama - Really! 
Oh, Kaushika, my father came to my mother's place from Himalayas! Has the great 
resplendent father of mine worshipped Rama because the redemption of my mother is 
per the kindness of Rama! Has this great-souled Rama reverenced that great resplendent 
father of mine by according a redemption,ahalyaa-daana, 
the endowment of Ahalya to her husband. 
"Oh, Kaushika, on his arrival at my mother's place whether this reverential Rama 
reverenced my father with a pacified heart without becoming contumelious!" Thus 
sage Shataananda exclaimed at the marvel occurred through Rama. 
On hearing that sentence of his, that great-saint and sentence-precisian Sage Vishvamitra, 
replied the sentence-precisionist Sage Shataananda. 
"I have done whatever good is to be done and nothing is left undone, and the wife 
of the sage, namely Ahalya, is reunited with her husband sage Gautama, as with Renuka 
who was reunited with sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu." So said Vishvamitra. 

On hearing those words of that highly intellectual Vishvamitra, high refulgent sage 
Shataananda spoke these words to Rama. 
Hail to thee! Oh, best one among men Rama, your arrival is a godsend, not only 
to Mithila but to entire humanity, and oh, Raghava, as an undefeatable great-sage 
Vishvamitra spearheads you, so shall your mission be undefeatable, thus hail to 
thee! 
This highly resplendent Vishvamitra's exploits are unimaginable. He attained the 
highest order of Brahma-sage by his ascesis, thus illimitable is his ascetic resplendence, 
and you have to know him as an ultimate course, not only to you alone, but also 
to one and all. 
None other than you is fortunate enough on earth, oh, Rama, as you are in the custodial 
care of Vishvamitra, the scion of Kushika, who has practised supreme ascesis. 
What is the prowess of the great-souled Vishvamitra, and what the quintessence 
of his legend may be heard from me while I narrate it. 
This probity-souled Vishvamitra, being a proficient in rectitude, a perfectionist 
in kingcraft, a proponent of people's welfare, more so a persecutor of enemies, 
was there as a king for a long time. 
There was a king named Kusha, a brainchild of Prjaapati, and Kusha's son was the 
powerful and verily righteous Kushanaabha. 
One who is highly renowned by the name Gaadhi was the son of Kushanaabha, and Gaadhi's 
son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra. 
Vishvamitra ruled the earth, and this great-resplendent king ruled the kingdom 
for many thousands of years. 
At one time the great-resplendent king Vishvamitra went round the earth marshalling 
a unit ofakshauhiniarmy. 
Moving sequentially about the provinces, cities, rivers likewise mountains, king 
Vishvamitra arrived at the threshold of a hermitage which is with numerous flowered 
trees and climbers, overspread with very many herds of animals, adored by the celestials 
like siddha-s and caarana-s, frequented and embellished with gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
and kinnara-s, spread out with equable deer, adored by flights of birds, compacted 
with the assemblages of Brahma-sages, and also with the assemblages of godly-sages 
who are fully accomplished in their ascesis, where the personal resplendence of 
each of the great-souled sage is similar to each of the Ritual-fire available in 
each of the Ritual Fire Altar before which he is sitting, and which hermitage is 
bustling with the activity of great-souled sages who are comparable to Brahma, among 
whom some subsist on water alone, and some on air alone, likewise some more on dry 
leaves, while some on fruits, tubers, and with such of those sages and also with 
particular sages like Vaalakhilyaa-s, also with others like Vaikhaanasa-s, who are 
all self-controlled, who have overcame their peccabilites, who have overpowered 
their senses that hermitage is occupied, and while everyone of the inmates is engaged 
in meditations and oblations into Ritual-fire, and with such sages and their activity 
whole of the perimeter of that hermitage is brightened and rendered splendent, and 
king Vishvamitra arrived at such a magnificent hermitage of Sage Vashishta. 
"And this best one among vanquishers and the great-stalwart Vishvamitra has then 
seen the hermitage of Vashishta which is like the worldly Universe of Brahma." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued his narration. While Bharata was narrating his dream, the messengers whose horses were tired,
entered the beautiful city called Rajagriha, which has too big a palace-gate and met the king Kekeya and the prince Yudhajit, who received them hospitably. They saluted the feet of the king Kekeya and spoke the following words to Bharata:
"Vasistha, the family-priest and all the ministers were asking about your welfare. Come forth indeed quickly. There is an urgent work with you."
"O, Bharata the wide-eyed man! Take these very valuable clothes and jewels and give them to your maternal uncle"
"O, prince! In these jewels and clothes, a worth of hundred crores is to be given to the king Kekeya and likewise a worth of ten crores in full to your maternal uncle."
Bharata, who had a great affection towards his kind hearted relatives, took all
that, honored these messengers profusely with gifts of their liking and spoke(as follows) : "I hope that king Dasaratha, my father is quite safe. I also hope that Rama and the high-soled Lakshmana are well."
"Is Kausalya, the venerable lady, who is intent on virtue, who knows righteousness, who visualizes goodness and who is the mother of the wise Rama, also well? "
"I hope that Sumitra, who knows righteousness, who is the mother of Lakshmana as
well as the heroic Satrughna and our middle mother, is well."
"As Kaikeyi, who loves herself, a forever fiery lady of wrathful nature, who prides herself to be highly intelligent and my mother, also well? What did she say?"
On hearing the words of the high soled Bharata, those messengers then respectfully spoke to Bharata as follows:
"O, tiger among men! Those, of whom you do enquire, are all well. The goddess of
prosperity, holding a lotus in her hand, awaits you. Let your chariot be made ready."
Hearing the words Bharata spoke to the messengers as follows: "I will get permission from the monarch(to leave for Ayodhya) saying that the messengers are hastening me up."
Bharata the prince having been asked to move quickly (to Ayodhya) by the messengers, spoke as aforesaid to those messengers and uttered the following words to his maternal uncle:
"O, king! Requested by the messengers to come to Ayodhya urgently, I am going to my father's presence. I shall again come, whenever you recall me."
Hearing the words of Bharata, the king Kekeya, his maternal uncle smelled (as a
token of affection) the head of Bharata and spoke the following auspicious words:
"Go, my dear child! I am permitting you. Kaikeyi is fortunate to have a good son
like you. Bear my greetings to your mother and father."
" My dear child! Pay obeisance to your family priest, the other illustrious Brahmins and your brothers Rama and Lakshmana the wielders of bows."
The king Kekaya, treating him hospitably gave that Bharata the best of elephants,
woolen clothes of varied colors, antelope skins and riches (gold and silver vessels etc).
The king Kekeya generously gave as gifts to Bharata, two thousands coins of gold and sixteen hundred horses.
Likewise, Aswapati sent some attendants, who were dear, reliable, endowed with
virtues and inmates of his palace with Bharata (to accompany him on the return journey) Yuddhajit, his maternal uncle gave him as gifts, elephants of Airavata race born in Indrasira mountain-range and which were charming to behold as well as mules which could walk quickly and were well trained.
He gave as a gift, large bodied dogs, which were well nourished in the gynoecium,
possessing strength and vitality of a tiger and which were using their tusks as weapons.
The wealth of gifts bestowed by the king Kekeya did not rejoice Bharata, Kaikeyi's son, who was then in a hurry to go.
Due to goading of messengers and visualization of the dream, a very big worry was
formed at that time in his heart.
The glorious Bharata crossed his very big palace, augmented with men elephants and horses and entered the excellent royal high way.
The sagacious Bharata crossed the royal high way and perceived the gynoecia. Then, the glorious Bharata entered those gynoecia.
Bharata took leave of his maternal grandfather and also Yudhajit, his maternal uncle and set out on a chariot (for Ayodhya) along with Satrughna.
With more than hundred chariots variegated with jewels yoked to camels, bullocks,
horses and mules as also servants followed Bharata as he departed.
Being protected by the army, the high soled Bharata, who was free from enemies,
taking Shatrughna along with other companions good enough to him, started from the palace of his venerable maternal uncle, as a Siddha(a semi- divine being of great purity and perfection and said to possess supernatural faculties) would start from Indraloka( the world of celestials).That wicked woman spoke these words to Dasaratha, tormented as he was by the anguish for his son and who was unconscious, tossing about on the floor.
"What is this? After hearing the promise given to me, you are lying on the floor
dejected as though you had committed a great sin. You ought to keep yourself within bounds of ethics".
"People who know what is right, indeed speak of truthfulness as highest virtue. I
too have taken refuge in truth and made you aware of your duty."
"Oh, king! Having made a promise to a hawk and offering his body to the bird , king Saibya, the ruler of world obtained the greatest destiny".
"In that manner, Alarka the glorious man plucking his own eyes, indeed gave
remorselessly, to a brahmana skilled in the Veda, When asked for them."
"Following ruthfulness, ocean the lord of rivers even at the time of flow-tide, does not transgress even to a small extent its boundary because of its compliance to truth."
"Truth is one word and is Brahma. On truth is righteousness established. Truth
indeed is the knowledge imperishable. By truth alone, the supreme being is obtained".
"O the best among men! firmly adhere to truth, if your mind is fixed on piety. Since you are a bestower of boons, let my aforesaid prayer be granted.
"In the matter, yearning righteousness and to concede to my request, send Rama the son to exile. I am telling to you three times".
"Oh, the venerable man! If you do not implement our agreement, it means you have
abandoned me. Hence I will give up my life here in front of you".
Thus compelled by Kaikeyi, who had no uneasiness in her mind, king Dasaratha could not untie the cord of plighted word that fettered him , any more than Bali could unloose the noose placed (round his body) by Indra(through his younger brother Vamana in order to deprive him of his sovereignty of the three worlds).
Like a bullock throbbing between yoke and the wheel , Dasaratha got agitated in
heart and became pale in his face.
King Dasaratha, with bedimmed eyes, was unable, as it were, to see. But with
difficulty, he controlled himself by recourse to firmness and spoke to Kaikeyi as follows.
"Oh, wicked woman! I abandon your hand, which was clasped by me in presence of
nuptial fire, when it was consecrated by sacred recitations as also your son begotten by me along with yourself".
"Oh, Queen! the night has gone by, with the return pf rising sun. Elderly people
will certainly quicken me for installation of Rama with the sacred materials procured for the purpose".
"Oh, woman of vicious conduct! If you obstruct Rama's installation, you including
your son cannot offer me water. Rama will be made to do the offering of water to me, after death.
"Having seen people with that joy before, I cannot see them with there happiness
ended, without any merriment and having their faces turned downward in grief".
While that great souled king was speaking to her as aforesaid, the holy night
endowed with, moon and stars began to become clear into a dawn.
Kaikeyi of vicious conduct and of skilful talk, filled with anger again spoke these harsh words to the king.
" Oh, king ! You are uttering words, which cannot be swallowed easily like in a
painful throat disease. You ought to summon your son Rama here without any delay."
"You will be the one who discharges duty, by installing my son to this kingdom, by making Rama to wander in woods and rid me of enemies."
Impelled again and again by Kaikeyi, like an excellent horse being severely thrashed with a whip, that king spoke these words to Kaikeyi.
"I am bound by the ties of morality. I lost my judgement. I wish to see the pious
Rama, my beloved elder son."
Meanwhile, the night began to become clear, with the rising of sun. While the
auspicious, moment united with lunar mansion approaching, the sage Vashishta who is rich in virtues surrounded by his disciples entered the capital city of Ayodhya briskly, having procured the requisite materials for Rama's coronation.
Passing through that city, whose streets were swept and watered decorated with ,
excellent flags, overspread with colourful flowers , made brilliant with various types of garlands, filled with people of joy, with shops and markets with abundance, filled with lot of festivities, anxiously waiting for Rama, fumigated on all sides with perfumes of sandalwood , also resembling Amaravathy city(capital of Indra); the sage Vashishta beheld the excellent, gynaecium filled with many a number of brahmanas, crowded with citizens and countrymen, looking splendorous with brahmanas, knowers of sacrificial assembly filled with excellent brahmanas.
Sage Vashishta, being well pleased of seeing that gynaecium, got past those people there and , entered it.
Meanwhile, Vashishta saw Sumantra by name, who was charioteer-cum-minister of
Dasaratha and who had a pleasing appearance coming out of the royal gate.
That great splendoured Vashishta spoke thus to the learned Sumantra, "Tell the king quickly, that I have come."
"These pitchers filled with holy waters of ganga , gold pitchers with sea water and an excellent seat with Udambara wood came for the purpose of Rama's installation ceremony. All types of seeds, fragrant substances and precious stones of various kinds, honey, curd, clarified butter, parched grains of paddy, blades of Darbha grass, flowers, milk, eight beautiful virgins , an elephant in rut, a glorious chariot with four horses, a special kind of sword called Nistrimsa, an excellent bow , a palanquin with bearers an umbrella resembling the moon , a pair of white chowries, a golden jug, a white bull with large , humo on its back, an excellent lion with beautiful mane with large canine teeth, a throne, a tiger skin, fire with ignition , all varieties of musical instruments,courtesans, women decked with ornaments, teachers, brahmanas, cows, animals and birds which are sacred, the best of citizens and men of country side, merchants along with their followers, all these and many other retainers speaking kind words, along with kings stand waiting for Rama's coronation.
Hasten the emperor, so that Rama will get the throne when the day gets started at
the auspicious moment of pushya constellation uniting with the moon"
Hearing these words Vashishta the great souled, Sumantra entered the gynaecium along with Dasaratha, the tiger among kings.
The doormen , who were wishing to do kindness to king, could not obstruct Sumantra, who came before hand who was senior and who was highly esteemed by the king.
Standing besides the king and ignorant of that situation, Sumantra started praising the king with very pleasing words.
Sumantra, standing with joined palms in the gynaecium of the king, eulogised the
king according to the appropriate moment as follows.
"How the splendid ocean gladdens at the time of sunrise, so do you by nature filled with delight, gladden us with your delighted mind."
"At the very hour of sunrise, Matali (Indra's charioteer)praised Indra and the
latter conquered all the demons. In the same manner, I am awakening you."
"As Vedas along with the knowledge of the limbs of the body guide Lord Brahma (the creator) who is self born, so am I awakening you now."
"Even as the sun along with the moon awaken the beautiful earth which sustains the beings so, am I awakening you."
"Having dressed suitably for the auspicious ceremony and shining brightly with you personality, raise up. Oh, Majesty, like the sun from mount Meru."
"Oh, Dasaratha born in Kakutsa dynasty! May the Gods -Sun and the Moon Shiva and
Kubera, Varuna, Agni and Indra bestow you victory!"
"Oh, the best of the kings ! The holy night has gone by. Know what has been done and do what has to be done. All the requirements for Rama's coronation is kept ready" .
"The venerable Vashishta himself stands waiting at the gate along with brahmanas,
being saluted saluted with joined palms by citizens, village folk and merchants."
"Oh king! Give orders quickly for Rama's coronation ceremony. A kingdom without a
king is like cattle without a herdsman, army without a commander, night without the moon and cows without a bull."
King Dasaratha hearing his words which were soothing and meaningful, was surrounded with grief once more.
That king who was pious and glorious, having lost joy about his son, looked up with sorrowful red eyes and spoke those to Sumantra. "You are chopping off my vitals further more, with your words!."
Sumantra, after seeing the depressed king and hearing mournful words, joined palms with salutation and slipped away to a distance from that place.
Dasaratha could not say any thing himself because of depression. Then, Kaikeyi who is experienced in fore-thoughts, spoke thus to Sumantra.
"Oh Sumantra! The king, being smitten by emotional joy in relation to Rama, who
tired of awakening the whole night and got subjected to sleep"
"Oh, Sumantra! Hence, quickly go and bring the glorious prince Rama. Blessedness to you! Do not have any hesitation in this matter. "
"He was thinking of that auspicious occasion in heart and rejoiced. With pleasure, he set out, by the orders of the king."
Instigated by her, Sumantra thought that the righteous Rama would come there
certainly for coronation.
Sumantra thus thinking and dwelling in a great joy, set out with a desire to see the long armed Rama Sumantra coming out of gynaceumwhich looked like a splendid pool in the sea, saw the gate being congested with throngs of people.
Afterwards, proceeding further on, he saw near the gate some kings stationed there and very rich citizens having arrived there.Then on going to Panchavati which is full with many serpents and predators, Rama said to splendidly 
brilliant Lakshmana. 
"We arrived at the place as indicated by the sage, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this region with its flowered 
forests is Panchavati." 
"In which place we have to situate our hermitage for our liking, for that cast your sight all over the 
forest, and indeed you are an expert in such matters. 
"In which place Vaidehi, likewise you and me too can take delight, where the woodland is scenic and 
the water is pleasurable, and where a water lake, ritual-firewood, flowers, and the sacred grass are 
available in proximity, oh, Lakshmana, such a place may be searched out. 
When thus said by Rama, Lakshmana adjoined his palms and said this sentence to Rama in the presence 
of Seetha. 
"I am but a dependent, as long as you are there, may it be for innumerable years, I am your adherent, 
Rama, therefore you yourself tell me to build hermitage in such and such delightful place. 
Rama is gladdened by those words of that great resplendent Lakshmana, and he selected a place that comprised 
of all the attributes. 
On taking Lakshmana's hand by his hand Rama paced that beautiful place intended for the construction 
of hermitage up and down and spoke to Soumitri this way. 
"This is an evenly and propitious place surrounded with flowered trees and it is apt of you to erect 
hermitage here, traditionally. 
"This pleasing lake is seen here adjacently, beaming forth with its lotuses that are similar to sun 
in resplendence, and that are scented fragrantly. 
"This River Godavari is also seen from here, surrounded by blooming trees, spread over with swans, and 
beautified with kaarandava, and chakravaaka birds, as that contemplated soul sage Agastya had said. 

"Those soaring mountains are appearing beautiful with many caves, surrounded by flowered trees, flurried 
by animal herds, sounded by peacocks, and they are neither far-off nor very nearby. 
"Here and there are the golden, silvery and coppery ores on the mountains, and they are shining forth 
like cow-eye ventilators on walls and also like the superb paintings on elephants. 
"These mountains are brightening with trees of Saala, Palmyra, Tamaala, Date Palms, Jackfruit and also 
thus with Punnaagaa. With Chuuta - Sweet Mango; Ashoka, Tialaka, even with Ketaka, Champaka trees, And 
even with Syandana, Sandalwood, Niipa, Paarnasa, Lakuch, dhava, Ashwakarna, Khadira, Shamii, Kimshuka, 
Paatala trees, and entwined are those and those trees with flowered shrubs, and along with climbers, 
and thus they brighten the mountains. 
"This place is holy, this is delightful and this is with many animals and birds, hence Soumitri, let 
us reside here along with this bird Jatayu." Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. 
Thus said by Rama to that remover of foe's valour and one with very great might, namely Lakshmana, he 
briskly erected a hermitage for his brother. 
Lakshmana built a very spacious straw-cottage there levelling and raising the clay for raised floor 
of the cottage, strongly pillared with long bamboos, thereupon on those pillars excellent rafters are 
made, and the branches of Shamii trees are spread out, twined firmly with twines of jute strands, and 
with the cross-laid bamboos for thatching, and over that blades of Kusha grass and leaves of Kaasha 
are spread and well over-covered for the roof, and thus that very great mighty Lakshmana made that best 
and very spacious straw-cottage with a levelled surface for residence of Raghava in the interests of 
Raghava alone, and it resulted as a feast to the eye. 
On his going to River Godavari that noble Lakshmana bathed and on gathering lotuses and fruits he returned 
to the cottage. 
Then making flowery offerings and peace-invocations also procedural togR^iha 
pravesha, entering a new house,] started to show the constructed hermitage to Rama. 
On seeing the beautifully constructed hermitage along with Seetha, Rama is highly gladdened in respect 
that straw-cottage. 
Then Rama very highly gladdened Rama embraced Lakshmana tightly by both of his hands, and spoke these 
friendly words to him. 
"Oh, masterful one, I am very happy about you for you have done a great deed, for that reason I am giving 
what I have to give to you a hugging. 
"You are the knower of others feelings, knower of many skills, and the knower of what is right and honest, 
oh, Lakshmana, such as you are, being with you I deem that my virtue-souled father is not gone and forgotten. 

On saying thus to Lakshmana, Raghava, the enhancer of magnificence comfortably resided in that province 
which is with many a fruit. 
While Seetha and Lakshmana devoted themselves to that righteous Rama, he resided in Panchavati like 
a Divinity in heavenly world for sometime to come. As the night was beginning to become dawn, those citizens relinquished by Raghava
were perplexed with grief and became motionless.
Made miserable with tears born of anguish and agony, they could not notice even a
glimmer of Rama, though casting their eyes everywhere.
Their faces distorted with sorrow, deprived as they were of sagacious Rama and
therefore non-pulsed, the citizens broke into piteous exclamations, saying:-
"Cursed be to that slumber, rendered unconscious, by which we could not behold today that mighty armed Rama with a broad chest."
"How that Rama the strong armed, whose actions are never ineffectual, leave for
exile, abandoning his devoted citizens?"
"How did the chief of Raghus, who protected us ever, like a father the children born of his loins, could proceed to the forest, leaving us?"
"Let us have recourse to death here itself, or definitely set out for a grand
journey ( to the north with a resolve to die). For what purpose can life be good for us, separated as we are from Rama?"
" Or there are a number of big dry logs of wood here. Lighting a funeral fire out of them, let us all enter the fire."
"What shall we say to our fellow citizens?  The great armed Rama who is free from
egoism and who speaks kindly ( to all ) has been conveyed to the forest by us!' How can we say so?"
"Seeing us returning without Rama, that city of Ayodhya, already desolate, will with its women, children and the aged, become even deeply cheerless."
"Having left the city thus with that hero, the conqueror of one's own self, how can we look on that city again without him?"
Uplifting their arms , those men stricken with anguish, like cows bereft of their
calves, lamented in various ways as above.
Then, proceeding to some distance along the tracks for a while, they were
overwhelmed with great despair again due to sudden disappearance of tracks.
The good-natured citizens, due to disappearance of the tracks of the chariot,
returned to Ayodhya, saying thus, " How is it? What shall we do? We are afflicted by providence"
Therafter, all of them with aggrieved hearts went to the city of Ayodhya, which was comprising of virtuous people with distress, by the same path on which they had come.
Beholding the city, they shed tears through their eyes stricken as they were in
grief , their minds distressed through cheerlessness.
Bereft of Rama, the aforesaid city of Ayodhya was not any more enchanting than a
river whose snakes were uplifted from its pool by Garuda.
As the sky without the moon or the sea without the water, these disconcerted men
beheld the city from which all joy had fled.
Entering their houses full of abundant riches with uneasiness, the citizens could
not distinguish between their own people and others, even though being looked at, stricken as they were with grief, their joy having altogether extinguished.Witnessing that thrilling converse between those two brothers with incomparable
dignity, the great sages gathered there were astonished.
The assemblies of ascetics, great saints present there and the distinguished sages who stood invisible in space, applauded both Rama and Bharata, the magnanimous brothers, saying (as follows):
"That Dasaratha, who begot these two sons, who know righteousness and whose strength is justice, was fortunate. By hearing the debate between these two princes, we are indeed delighted."
Thereafter, that assembly of sages, who wished to see a quick destruction of Ravana, came together and spoke the following words to Bharata, the excellent king.
"O Bharata born in a noble race, highly intelligent, having a superior conduct and a great repute! If you have regard for your father, Rama's words are to be accepted.
"We wish to see Rama absolved of all obligations forever to his father. Dasaratha, having honoured his pledge to Kaikeyi, indeed went to heaven."
Having uttered that much, all the celestial musicians and the great sages then went to their respective abodes.
Hearing those auspicious words, the good-looking Rama looked radiant and worshipped those sages with a joyful countenance.
Bharata, on his part, with trembled limbs, joined his palms in salutation and again spoke the following words to Rama in a strangled voice:
"O, Rama! Keep in view the continuance of our royal statue and the statute of the
race. You ought to yield to the entreaties of mine and those of your mother."
"I am not able to rule this vast empire alone to the satisfaction of the beloved
inhabitants of town and country!"
"Our kith and king, soldiers, companions and allies are waiting for you indeed, as farmers wait for the rainy clouds."
"O, the sagacious Rama! Return to the kingdom and keep it in order. You have the
competence to save the world!"
That Bharata, who was kind-spoken, thus made a fervent appeal to Rama and fell at
his feet.
Placing on his lap, that Bharata of dark hue, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and having a voice like that of a swan in rut, Rama spoke the following words to him:
"O, my dear brother! You are very much competent to rule the earth, by the intellect you obtained both inherently and by training."
"Take counsel with your ministers, companions and intelligent counsellors and get
all activities done, even if they are gigantic."
"Light may go off from the moon; Himalayan mountain may shake off its snows; the sea may transgress its shores, but I will never be false to my father's vow!"
"My dear brother! Your mother acted thus, for your sake, out of her affection or
ambition. It should not be carried out in your mind. You ought to obey her as your mother."
Bharata replied (as follows) to Rama, who was speaking as aforesaid and who was
equal to sun by his splendour or to the moon in its first quarter.
"O, noble brother! Pray mount with your feet on the wooden sandals adorned with
gold! Surely, these will bestow, gain and security to all the people!"
Rama, the tiger among men, possessing exceptional glory, placing his feet on the
sandals and leaving them, gave them to the magnanimous Bharata.
Bowing before the sandals, Bharata spoke the following words to Rama: "O, Rama the hero and the tormentator of enemies! For fourteen years, I shall wear matted locks and robes of bark, live on fruits and roots O Rama, and live outside the city, offering the ruling of the kingdom to your sandals."
"O, Rama! If I do not see you the following day when the fourteenth year has fully ended, I shall enter the fire once for all."
"So be it" promised Rama, embraced that Bharata with affection, took Shatrughna also in his arms and spoke to Bharata as follows:
"O Bharata! Protect your mother, Kaikeyi. Do not get angry with her. You are taken vow thus by me and by Seetha." speaking thus, Rama with his eyes filled iwth tears, bade farewell to his brother.
The valiant Bharata, who knew righteousness worshipped those sandals which were
well-decorated made a circumambulation to Rama and kept the sandals on the head of an excellent elephant.
Rama, the augmentator of Raghu dynasty, being firm as a Himalayan rock in abiding in his own righteousness, greeted those men, in accord with their rank, the host of his preceptors, ministers, subjects and his brothers and bade farewell to all of them.
His mothers, their voices choked with tears due to sorrow, were unable to bid
farewell verbally to Rama. However, Rama himself offered his salutations to all his mothers and entered his hermitage, weeping.They all quickly went to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in the
thickets of forest trees and waited.
That forest lover with tumultuous voice Sugreeva cast his eye everywhere and assumed
tremendous fury. 
Then Sugreeva encompassed by his followers war-whooped ghastlily, like a great cloud
that emerged accelerated by gusty wind and that is thundering as though to rip the sky, inviting
Vali for a fight. 
Then Sugreeva who is like the rising sun and whose stride is like that of a proud
Lion saw the adroit Rama and then said this sentence. 
" She whose arch-way is decorated in gold, who is spread out with snares of monkeys,
and who is impregnated with flags and machinery, we arrived at such city of Vali, Kishkindha.

"Oh Brave one, you make happen the promise you earlier made regarding the
elimination of Vali on time, like the time of sprouting that enables a creeper plant to bear a
sprout on time. 
When thus said by Sugreeva that enemy-destroyer and righteous Raghava said this word
Sugreeva. 
"By which creeper-garland that Lakshmana plucked out and garlanded you, by this
creeper-garland of gaja-flowers alone your identification is marked.
"Oh brave one, you are shining forth with this creeper garland laced at your neck
like the nighttime sun with a garland of stars. 
"Oh Vanara, today itself I will set you free from the fear and enmity whipped up by
Vali releases a single arrow in a fight.
"You show me your enemy in a brother's mien, oh, monkey, by then he will be rolling
in the dust of this forest eliminated by me. 
"If he returns to live even after my espying him then immediately you can find fault
with me, you can even deride me.
"Seven small trees are rived with a single of the arrow of mine in your presence,
thereby be sure that Vali will be dispatched now, by my might. 
"Just bound by the anxiousness to implement righteousness untruth is unsaid by me
earlier though I have been involved in distress for a long time, and hereafter it will not be said in
anywise. 
"As Indra fructifies the sprouted paddy field I will make happen my promise, hence
leave off your perplexity." 
"Thereby to invite that Vali with golden pendant, oh, Sugreeva, you make such a
war cry by which that monkey Vali comes out. 
"Vali is a willing fighter who shines forth by his victories and one who is given
ovation for his triumphs, and undefeated by you as yet, such as he is he may be incited with
war-whoop so that he comes out without any hindrance. 
"One who is assertive of his valour will not tolerate to hear enemy's daring in
a brawl, that too in the presence of ladies." So said Rama to Sugreeva. 
On hearing the words of Rama the Sugreeva with a golden yellow complexion blared a
gruesome blare as though to completely rend the sky. 
By that sound of Sugreeva the splendour of cows is marred and they are running
helter-skelter like the well-born ladies who are mishandled by invaders due to the misrule of their
own king.
Deer are hurriedly fleeing like war worsted horses, and the sky-flying birds are
falling to the ground like planets or stars when their merit diminishes. 
Sugreeva, the son of the Sun, who is well-known for cloud-like thundering, and whose
vigour is now reinforced by his bravery, then promptly releases an oceanic roar like an ocean with
splashing waves drifted by gales. "Oh, great enemy destroyer Rama, my elder brother Vali is a very dear one to our
father, and even for me too he was so, earlier. 
After the demise of our father, all the ministers have glorified him immensely and
made him the king of all the monkeys as he is the elder. 
While he was ruling the great kingdom of my father and forefathers, I have always
bowed down to him like a servant and stood by him. 
There was a fierce demon named Maayaavi, the elder brother of Dundubhi and the son
of one demon named Maya. There was a great enmity between this Maayaavi and Vali owing to some
females. 
He that Maayaavi arrived at the doors of Kishkindha on a night when the people were
sleeping, and blared very much inviting Vali for a fight. 
Then my brother who was also sleeping well, on hearing that bellowing in a
the clamoring voice did not tolerate and came out speedily.
Though the females and I bowed reverently to prevent Vali, he came out of
the palace in all his anger to kill that great demon. 
But Vali spurned all of us away and forged ahead, and then I also started to go
along with Vali in all my predisposition. 
A great fear was induced in that demon on seeing my brother and me coming from a
distance, and then he quickly ran away. 
While he is running away in fear we quickly follow him on a path that is barely
lit by the moonlight of the moon that is just coming up. 
That demon speedily entered an un-enterable cavity under the ground, covered with
grass, and we too having reached there speedily stood at the aperture of that cavity for a while.

Then Vali went into the enfoldment of fury on observing the entry of that demon
into the hole, whereby his senses felt outraged, and he said this sentence to me.\
Then Vali said to me, "Now you stay here on the alert, Sugreeva, at the entrance of
this hole till I return on destroying the enemy in a fight on my entering this hole..."
On hearing those words I requested him to allow me too to come into the hole, but
he being the great tormentor of his enemies disallowed it, and he made me swear on his feet and
entered that hole. 
Well over a year is over after he enters into that cleavage, and to me too who
stayed at the entrance of the cleavage that much time had passed away. 
I thought I lost him for my brother is unseen, and in all fondness towards him my
mind started to doubt about some harm might have befallen him. [4-9-16]
After a long time, blood with foam gushed out that hole, and on seeing it I was
deeply saddened.
Sounds of the screaming demon came to my ear, but the screeches of my brother who was
involved in the fight were unheard, in the least. 
Oh, friend, Rama... I have surmised and concluded in mind by the indications that my
brother is finished, and covered the cavity's opening with a mountain-similar boulder, 
performed water oblations to my deceased brother with saddening pain, and then returned to
Kishkindha. But the ministers have persuaded and heard from me the actual happening though I was
concealing it. 
Then duly summoned by all of those ministers I was crowned, and while I was ruling
the kingdom judiciously, oh, Raghava, that semi-human Vali returned on killing that demoniac enemy.

But on seeing me crowned his eyes were reddened in anger, and he arrested all my
ministers as he spoke rudely. 
And oh, Raghava, though I was capable enough to counter him, my reason was
controlled by my esteem for brotherhood, and I was indisposed to commit that sin of defying
brotherhood. 
He that brother of mine entered the capital thus on destroying the enemy, and I
hailed him as usual while respecting that audacious soul, but his inner self was unsatisfied, and I
remained unblest. 
Oh, lord Rama, though I bowed with the crown touching his feet, he that rancorous
Vali showed no quarter towards me." So said Sugreeva to Rama.Sugreeva is gladdened and satisfied too by that sentence and says this sentence to
Lakshmana's elder brother, Rama the valiant one. 
"When you with all kinds of endowment and good virtues are my friend, doubtlessly I
am worthy to be blessed by all gods in every way. 
"Oh, merited one, with your help it will be possible to achieve the kingdom of gods, oh,
lord, then why tell about one's kingdom... 
"He who has gained the one born in Raghava-s dynasty as a friend, to which sacred fire
bore the witness, such a being like me is estimable among his relatives, more so among his
kind-hearted friends... 
"Even though I am a matching friend to you, that you will know soon, it will be
inexpedient of me to talk about my inherent capabilities. 
"Great souls of your kind, whose hearts are purified like yours, oh, amiable Rama,
their friendship and courage will generally be stable. 
"Gentle souls will be knowing that silver or gold, or even prosperous ornaments are
not to be apportioned among themselves as this is mine and that is yours.
"May he be rich or poor, saddened or gladdened, flawless or flawed, a friend is the
ultimate recourse to any.
"On observing the course of friendship and knowing which is true friendship, the
true friends do not hesitate to extend wealth, pleasure or even their own country for the sake of
friendship." Sugreeva thus extolled Rama and his friendship. 
"That is thus only," said Rama before Lakshmana, Lakshmana is sagacious,
resplendent, and vies with Indra, about what is said by Sugreeva, which Sugreeva is by now
soft-natured in his looks, doffing off his jittery look.
Then on seeing Rama standing there with greatly mighty Lakshmana, Sugreeva cast his
sight with his bolting eyes around that forest. 
He that lord of monkeys Sugreeva has then seen a well-flowered sala tree not far off
from there, covered with some leaves and bedecked with honeybees. 
And Sugreeva broke off one branch of that sala tree that with many leaves and a
well, charming one, and spreading it out for Rama, he sat on it with Raghava. 
On seeing those two sitting on a branch then Hanuma also broke a branch of the sala tree
for the modest Lakshmana and seated Lakshmana on it. 
Then to him, who by now is comfortably sitting on a flowery mat laid by the bestrewn
flowers of sala trees on that best mountain like a quiet ocean, to such Rama who by his very
presence delights hearts, that gladsome Sugreeva said this in friendship with his gentle and
gracious words that fluttered with happiness while he spoke. 
"My brother calumniated me and stole my wife, with his fear and my anguish haunting
me I am moving about this best mountain Rishyamuka. 
"Affronted by my brother, oh, Raghava, I am made as his enemy, such as I am, I am
living on with a scared and dazed vitality far-flung in fear.
"I am agonized by the fear from Vali, oh, protector of all the worlds, you protect
me too for I am unprotected, and able are you to accord protection." Thus Sugreeva appealed to
Rama. 
Thus said Sugreeva, the resplendent and virtuous Rama, the patron of
righteousness replied Sugreeva as though laughing off the task. 
"Helping is the fruit of friendship while harming is the enemy's trait, hence I wish to
kill him today only, that abductor of your wife..." Rama continued thus. 
"These are my arrows winged from pinion of the hern, oh, highly fortunate Sugreeva,
these are decorated in gold and sparkle sharply like the Thunderbolts of Indra, and they are
begotten from the reed forest of Kartikeya, ends tied with eagle feathers for fins, smooth are
their nodes, sharp are their tips that pierce sharply, and these will be like enraged snakes.

"You may see your malicious and intimidating brother, someone denotative by name
Vali, eradicated with these very arrows and splintered down like a mountain." Rama said so to
Sugreeva. 
On hearing Raghava's words, the lord of monkey-force Sugreeva attained much
happiness and said, 'good, good...'
"Rama, I am confounded in sadness, and for those lamenting sadly you are the only
recourse, and because you have befriended me I am opening up my woes before you.
"By extending a helping hand and befriending me while sacred fire bore witness, you
have indeed become my dearest friend on par with my life, and hence I take promise on truth to
broach. 
"By befriending you I can say clearly about my internal sorrow without any
hitches and hold-ups, which is always rending my heart..." So said Sugreeva to Rama. 
Sugreeva said this sentence with tears abusing his eyes and his voice is unable
to talk aloud since it is equally abused by tears. 
Sugreeva courageously controlled the sudden haste of tears that came up hastily and
suddenly like a river in the presence of Rama. 
He that bright Sugreeva controlled those tears, and on wiping his fortunate eyes,
but sighing heavily he again started to speak this sentence to Raghava. 
"Earlier he that forceful Vali deposed me from my kingdom, oh Rama, and speaking
harsh words he even banished me. 
"My wife who is loftier than my life is stolen by him, and those that are my
sympathizers are also captivated and imprisoned by him. 
"He that very evil-minded one tried many times to annihilate me, and Raghava, I
killed those combatant monkeys that were deployed by Vali to kill me. 
"With the same doubt, I was not even near you when I saw you... in fear everything
will be fearsome, won't it... 
"Though I am engulfed in tribulations I still bear my lives even today due to these
important monkeys like Hanuma and others, who are the only helping hands of mine. 
"These are the friendly monkeys guarding me all over, while I go they go along with
me, and if I were to stay they too will stay. 
"Rama, this is briefly my sad story and why tell this very broadly to you as it
would be too tedious... my elder brother Vali is renowned for his intrepidity, and he that
Vali alone is my enemy. 
"His end ends my distress and my later life and quietude are subjected to his
destruction.
"Grief-stricken such as I am, I have submitted as to how my misery ends, whether one
is gladdened or saddened he has recourse only to his friend." So said Sugreeva to Rama.

Hearing all that is spoken by Sugreeva, Rama asked, "What for chanced the enmity? I
am interested to listen, in its reality...
"On knowing the cause of your enmity, oh, monkey, and after a proper thought, and
deciding upon the strength and weakness of the cause of enmity, or of the enmity itself, I will do
the needful very easily. 
"On hearing that you are insulted my intense anger that can flutter my heartbeat is
intensifying like the intensifying speed of waters in rainy reason. 
"Be glad to say in belief, Sugreeva, before I aim with my bow, and even before
I release the arrow, and even before silencing your enemy." Rama assured Sugreeva in this way.

Thus said by the great-souled Rama, Sugreeva is very much rejoiced along with four
of vanara-s available in his attendance. 
Then with a pleased countenance, Sugreeva started to tell Rama about the cause of the
enmity, it all its truthfulness. 
On calling forth all the fly-jumpers for achieving the purpose of Rama's task the
best fly-jumper and the king of monkeys Sugreeva spoke to all of them, "Oh, best vanara-s, you
shall search all of this earth as I have detailed." Sugreeva said so to all monkeys. [--,
a]
Understanding that arduous order of the king of monkeys Sugreeva those best monkeys
started out covering the earth like grasshoppers. 
Rama remained on Mt. Prasravana along with Lakshmana looking forward to that
month which is marked for locating Seetha. 
Then the brave monkey Shatabali swiftly started towards the beautiful northern
quarter that is encompassed by the king of mountains, namely Himavanta. 
The monkey-troop commander Vinata journeyed towards the eastern direction, and the
fly-jumper, leader of monkeys and Air-god's son Hanuma travelled towards the southerly quarter that was
once trodden by Sage Agastya, along with Lt. Tara, Prince-regent Angada, and others. [--b,
]
The commander of fly-jumpers and a tiger monkey Sushena started towards the
horrifying western direction that is ruled by Varuna, the Rain-god. 
Then on disposing the commanders of the monkey army to all directions according to their
capabilities, that valorous king Sugreeva who is contented earlier by way of gaining his kingdom
through Rama, is now gladdened to his heart's content for sending monkey troops to all directions
as a requital to Rama's help. 
In this way when despatched by their king Sugreeva all the vanara lieutenants
expeditiously started towards one's direction. 
When those great mighty fly-jumpers have started to dash off some are bawling, some
highly blaring, some more thundering, and some more oddly bellowing, while some more are roaring
like lions. 
Well-motivated this way by the king Sugreeva those vanara lieutenants put their
fortitude into boastful words and said, "We lead forth Seetha, we wish to kill Ravana."

"I will kill Ravana single-handedly if he chances on the battlefield, and then on
drubbing the other demons I will quickly bring back Janaka's daughter, Seetha." Another monkey
soldier said so. 
"I alone will bring back Janaki even from netherworlds, who might be shivering owing
to enervation, and you my monkey-soldier colleagues, you all may stay behind now." Thus another
monkey-hero said. 
"I will completely shatter the trees, shred the mountains, split the earth, and storm
the oceans." Thus another monkey gave a war cry. 
"I can fly-jump a hundred yojana-s, undoubtedly," said one monkey while the other
said, "I can jump even more than a hundred yojana-s, for sure." 
"My transit cannot be thwarted either on the plane of earth, or in the ocean, or on
mountains or in forests, or the netherworld, or its core." This is the slogan of another
monkey-warrior. 
Thus each vanara gave war-whoops with the proper pride of his might in
the audience of Monkey King Sugreeva and departed. Manthara feels very sad after hearing about anointment of Rama for the princely kingdom. She tells Kaikeyi about the coronation of Rama. Kaikeyi becomes delighted and gives Manthara one of her jewels.
Manthara, a housemaid who was residing with Kaikeyi since her birth, accidentally
ascended the balcony of Kaikeyi's white palace, which resembled the full moon.
Manthara, from that balcony, saw the entire city of Ayodhya, with all its principal roads being sprinkled with water and strewn with heaps of flowers.
Manthara further saw from that balcony the city decorated with the best of flags and banners. The roads were cleared for uninterrupted traffic. All the people took head-bath. Brahmans with flowers and sweets in their hands were chanting Mantras. The gateways of temples were white washed. There were sounds of all musical instruments. The city was filled with rejoicing people and resounding chant of Vedas. The elephants and horses were also merry. The bulls were making roaring noise. The highly delighted citizens hoisted rows of flags on their housetops.
Manthara asked a house maid with bright pleasing eyes and wearing white silk clothes standing nearby, as follows: - "Why is Kausalya giving away money to people so delightfully today in charity, eventhough she is badly lured of money?"
"Why are people so happy today? Is the king duly pleased with something, doing any great act? Tell me."
That housemaid, bursting with joy, told Manthara in a great gladdening tone about
the great honor to be conferred upon Rama.
"Tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star, king Dasaratha is going to anoint the
fault-less Rama for the princely kingdom."
After hearing the words of that maid, Manthara quickly with wrath walked down from the roof of the palace, which was in the shape of mount Kailasa.
Manthara of sinful thought; burning with anger, approached Kaikeyi who was lying on a bed and spoke these words: "O, fool! Get up. Why are you sleeping? A dreadful situation is befalling you. A flood of troubles submerges you. Why are you not knowing this yourself?"
"Oh, Kaikeyi ! You appear to be a beloved wife for your husband, but in reality he does not like you. You boast of your fortune. Like the flow of a stream in summer; your fortune is unsteady".
Kaikeyi was very much worried after hearing hard words spoken with anger by Manthara of sinful thoughts.
Kaikeyi asked the hunch-backed Manthara as follows; "O, Manthara! Are you not safe?
You appear to be very sorrowful with your worried face".
After hearing Kaikeyi's sweet words, Manthara who was an expert in talking, spoke
with anger.
That Manthara, who was full of cunning, feigning to be seeking Kaikeyi's welfare,
appeared more worried, and making Kaikeyi sorrowful, spoke the following, to create hostility between Rama and Kaikeyi.
"Oh, queen! An unending great ruin has encircled you. King Dasaratha is going to
anoint Rama for the princely kingdom".
"I am immersed in a bottomless pit of fear. I am in distress and my mind is burning as if by fire. I hastened here to seek you out."
"Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes king, his son will become king after him. Thus, Bharata's name itself will be removed from the royal clan."
"Oh, Kaikeyi! Having born in a royal family and being an emperor's wife, how is it that you are not knowing about the cruelty in kingly duties?"
"Your husband talks about righteousness, but does harm secretly. He says sweet words but behaves cruelly. Because of your clean thinking; you are not able to know that he is cheating you thus."
"Your husband approaches you and talks good words, which are useless. But he passes on benefit today to Kausalya only."
"The evil minded Dasaratha sent Bharata to the house of his relatives and at dawn, is going to install Rama on the throne without hindrance."
"O, childish one! Like a mother, you wish for his well being. But he is an enemy,
and is called husband for a namesake. He is like a poisonous serpent in your bosom."
"King Dasaratha has acted towards you and your son today in the same way as an enemy or a serpent would behave if ignored."
"O, stupid one! With his untruthful sweet words to you, who are ever deserving of
ease, the evil minded king is installing Rama on the throne and is thus ruining you along with your son."
"O, Kaikeyi, of amazing beauty! You have to take timely action immediately, so as to save yourself, your son and me too."
Hearing Manthara's words, that Kaikeyi of charming countenance who was lying in bed, rose from her coach full of delight like unto the crescent moon in autumn.
That Kaikeyi in the midst of her astonishment and joy gave a graceful jewel to the hunch-backed Manthara.
Kaikeyi, the best among women, gave a jewel to Manthara and spoke to her as
follows: "Oh, Manthara! You informed much gladdening news to me. What else can I do for you, who informed such a good news?"
"I do not see any difference between Rama and Bharata. That is why, I am happy that Rama is being anointed for crown by the king."
"O, Manthara! You do merit every favor. I have no other pleasant news than this.
Hence, you cannot ever again inform a better loving news than this. I shall give you a good boon. Ask for it!"At dawn after that night the great saint Vishvamitra spoke to the legatees of Kakutstha, Rama 
and Lakshmana, those that are sleeping on a grass bed. 
"Fortunate is Kausalya to beget you as her son Rama... get up oh, tigerly-man, eastern aurora 
is emerging, daytime tasks towards gods are to be performed." 
On hearing the benign words of the sage those valorous and best ones among men got up, bathed, 
and on offering water oblation they meditated upon the supreme hymn, namely Gayatri. 
On performing their dawn time duties those two stalwarts, Rama and Lakshmana, enthusiastically 
presented themselves before the ascetically rich sage Vishvamitra for further journey, duly 
venerating him. 
Then on travelling some more distance those two great valiant ones, there they have seen the 
divine river that courses in three ways, namely Ganga, at the auspicious confluence of River 
Sarayu. 
There they have seen the merited hermitage of sages with contemplative souls, and who are 
practising supreme ascesis for many thousand years. 
On seeing that merited hermitage Rama and Lakshmana are highly pleased and said this word 
to that great-soul Sage Vishvamitra. 
"Whose hermitage is this merited one? Indeed who is the celebrity that lives therein? Oh, 
godly sage, we are interested to listen, and we are truly inquisitive about it." Thus they 
asked. 
On hearing their words the eminent sage Viswamitra said smilingly, " whose hermitage is this 
in earlier times that may be listened." Thus Vishvamitra started to narrate. 
"When Love-god was with his body wise men used to call him Kama, the passion. At this place, 
that Love-god with his naughty intent braved god of gods Shiva who had been practising ascesis 
and who concentrated observantly, and who was returning after his marriage along with his 
followers, namely the Wind-gods, and that great soul Shiva disapprovingly roared at Love-god. 

"And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his 
limbs to fall down from his body. 
"There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by 
the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity. 
Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is 
given up that is renowned as Anga province. 
"This merited hermitage thus belongs to Shiva and, oh, brave Rama, these sages abiding in 
virtue are Shiva's disciples at one time, thus sin is unverifiable with them. 
"Let us stay for this night in this hermitage situated in between two meritorious rivers Ganga 
and Sarayu, oh, Rama with auspicious mien, tomorrow we will cross over the River Ganga. 
"Let us all purify ourselves by taking our bath, performing our meditations, offering our 
daily oblations, and then let us enter this meritorious hermitage, thus our stay in here will 
be comforting to us." So said Vishvamitra to Rama and Lakshmana. 
When they are discussing there the sages of that hermitage are highly gladdened to perceive 
them with their sixth-sense, and on approaching them enchantedly they offered water for hands 
and feet wash and then offered hospitality firstly to Sage Vishvamitra. 
Afterwards those sages of that hermitage have accorded reception to Rama and Lakshmana, and 
applauded by Vishvamitra for their hospitality those sages have entertained Rama and other 
guests with myths and legends. 
Those sages with concentrated minds and according to one's own aptitude have meditated upon 
the deity of sunset when it is sundown, followed by Rama and others. Then led into hermitage 
by those sages who are with pious commitments and who are dwelling there, Rama and others 
have very comfortably stayed in the precincts of Shiva's hermitage. 
Staying very comfortably in the precincts of Kaama hermitage, 
then that virtuous sage Vishvamitra, saint the eminent, delighted the delightful princes with delighting stories.....Then, after giving the jewel for the head, Seetha spoke to Hanuma as follows: "This token 
of remembrance is known to Rama."
"By seeing this jewel, the heroic Rama can recollect three of us, viz. my mother, myself 
and the king Dasaratha."
"O Hanuma the excellent among monkeys! Driven by your enthusiasm again, think about what remains 
to be done in undertaking this task."
"O Hanuma the best among monkeys! You are capable of fulfilling this task. O Hanuma! 
Become the one who can remove my misfortunes, by employing your effort. If you think of it carefully, 
your effort will become the one which can remove my misfortunes."
That Hanuma of terrific prowess, having promised 'so be it', offered salutation to Seetha 
by bowing his head to her and set off to go.
Getting to know Hanuma and ready to set out, Seetha the princess spoke the following words 
with her voice choked by tears.
"O Hanuma, the excellent among monkeys! Ask about the welfare of both Rama and Lakshmana 
together. You also ask, according to our usage, about the welfare of Sugreeva together with his ministers 
and of all the elder monkeys."
"You deserve to evolve a strategy through which the long-armed Rama can make me cross 
over this ocean of misfortunes."
"O Hanuma! Tell, in whatever manner, by which the illustrious Rama can console me, even 
while I am still surviving. Reap righteousness, by helping me through your word."
"Constantly hearing the words endowed with energy spoken by you, Rama's manly strength 
will be intensified to recover me."
'Hearing the words containing my message from you, the valiant Rama will duly set his 
heart in exercising his strength."
Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god, having placed his open hands 
side by side, slightly shallowed on his head in salutation), spoke the following words in reply.
"Coming soon together with valiant monkeys and bears, Rama after defeating the enemies 
in battle, will eliminate your sorrow."
"While discharging his arrows, none can be seen either in men or in monkeys or celestials 
who can stand before Rama in battle."
"That Rama is capable of enduring even the sun-god, even Indra the god of rain, or even 
Yama the god of death, son of the sun god a battle-field especially for your sake."
"Rama is indeed worthwhile to master the entire earth bounded by the ocean. O Seetha! 
Rama's victory is indeed for your sake."
Hearing those words of Hanuma, spoken rightly and truly well, Seetha held him in great 
respect and proceeded to speak (the following) words:
Thereupon, looking again and again towards that Hanuma who was going away, Seetha kind-heartedly 
adored his words endowed with friendliness for her husband.
"O valiant monkey, the annihilator of enemies! If you are agreeable, stay for a day at 
any one secret place. After taking a rest, you can go tomorrow."
"O Hanuma! Because of your vicinity, there may be a relief for a moment to this great 
sorrow of me, who is less fortunate."
"O Hanuma the lion among the monkeys! If after that, there is any doubt about your return, 
there is a doubt even for my survival too. There is no suspicion about this matter."
'O Hanuma! To me, who is tormented by one grief after another grief, my sorrow due to 
your disappearance will further torment me, like a burning flame."
"O best among the monkeys! O valiant one! In the matter of monkeys and bears who are 
your helpmates, this highly great doubt is lingering before me."
"How indeed can those troops of monkeys and bears or Rama and Lakshmana cross that 
great insurmountable ocean?"
"Three beings viz. Garuda the eagle, or yourself or the wind god only have the capacity 
of crossing this ocean."
"O valiant monkey! That is why, what strategy are you visualizing to fulfill this act, 
which is thus impassable? You are indeed excellent for those who know how to accomplish a task.
"O Hanuma the annihilator of hostile enemies! You, as one alone, are capable of fulfilling 
this task. Your act of fulfilling the result is well-known."
"If Rama defeats Ravana with his entire army in battle and as a champion takes me back 
to his city, it will be quite worthy of him."
"If Rama, the destroyer of the rival army, fills the entire Lanka with his arrows and takes 
me home, it will be quite worthy of him."
"For that reason, you act in such a way, that Rama the high-souled man, valiant in battle, 
may exhibit the prowess befitting of him."
Hearing those words, which were meaningful humble, and attended with reason, Hanuma gave 
his final reply (as follows)
"O Seetha the princess! Sugreeva, the Lord of the troops of monkeys and bears and the 
foremost among the monkeys, who is endowed with strength, is firmly determined in your cause."
"O Seetha! That Sugreeva, endowed with thousands and crores of monkeys, will come soon 
to destroy the demons."
"So many monkeys, endowed with prowess, perseverance, great strength, and who can rush 
to any place as they wish and are intensely committed to Sugreeva's command.
"There is no hindrance to their movement either in the sky or in the ground or any 
horizontal region (between the sky and the ground) with unlimited splendor are not indolent in performing 
any great task."
"The earth with its oceans and mountains has been circumambulated clockwise many times 
by those monkeys, who are highly energetic and who follow the aerial path."
"In them, some of the monkeys are superior to me and some are even equal to me. No one 
in the vicinity of Sugreeva is inferior to me."
"When I have arrived here, why talk about the mighty ones? Generally, superior ones 
are not sent for errands. Only others are indeed sent."
"O Seetha the princess! Enough of your lamentation. Take away your sorrow. Those leaders 
of monkeys will reach Lanka by one single leap."
"Rama and Lakshmana, those two lions among men also of great strength, ascending on my 
shoulders can come to you, like the rising sun and the moon."
"Coming together, Rama and Lakshmana the valiant and the excellent among men, can destroy 
the City of Lanka with their arrows."
"O Seetha with a good waist! Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, killing Ravana together 
with his troops, will return to his town, duly taking you with him."
"For that reason, console yourself indeed! Happiness to you! If you wait for some time, 
you shall see, within a short time, Rama like a blazing fire."
"When this king of demons is killed along with his sons, ministers, and relatives, you 
will meet Rama, as Rohini* met the moon."
"O Seetha the princess! You shall see the end of your sorrow soon. Within a short time, 
you will also see the end of Ravana, as destroyed by Rama."
Thus consoling Seetha, Hanuma the son of the wind-god made up his mind to go back and spoke 
to Seetha again as follows:
"That Rama the annihilator of enemies, who firmly decided to destroy his adversaries and Lakshmana wielding a bow in his hand will soon reach the entrance of Lanka and you will see them."
"You can see soon those valiant monkeys, with their claws and tusks as weapons, having 
the prowess of lions and tigers and looking like lordly elephants, coming together."
"O venerable lady! You shall see many troops of excellent monkeys resembling hills and 
clouds, thundering on the peaks of Malaya mountain in Lanka."
"Hit in the vitals by the darts of venerable Manmatha the god of love, Rama is not obtaining 
happiness, as an elephant gets tormented by a lion."
"O Seetha the princess! Do not weep with grief. Let your mind be without any unpleasantness. 
You are indeed having Rama your husband as your protector like Shachi having Indra her husband as a 
protector."
"Who else is there greater than Rama or who else equal to Lakshmana? Those two brothers, 
like fire and wind, are supportive to you."
"O Seetha the princess! You will not stay for long at this place, which is very terrific 
and occupied with a multitude of demons. The arrival of your husband will not be delayed. Be patient 
till the moment of my meeting with Rama on my return."Seeing her husband and the mighty Lakshmana having been killed, Seetha was very much
emaiated through grief and lamented pitiably (as follows):
"The sooth sayers, reading the marks and signs on my body, prophesized that I shall
bear sons and never be widowed. Now that Rama has been slain, their words have proved to be
untrue."
"Since Rama is slian, all those astrologers, who predicted that I shold be the
companio of a sattra sacrifice and the consort of the performer of great sacrifices, now have
proved to be utteres of falsehood."
"Now that Rama has been slain, all those sooth-sayers who predicted that I should be
honoured by my husband as well as the wives of warriors and kings, are proved to be liars."
"Now that Rama has been slain, all those astrologers among the wise brahmins. Who
openly foretold that I should remain happy with my husband are proved to have spoken falsely!"
"Yet I bear the marks of lotus on my soles by virtue of which high-born women are
consecrated on an imperial throne with their husbands and lords."
"I do not find those marks of ill-fortune which betoken widowhood in women who are
ill-starred and as I examine, all the auspicious signs appear to be rendered void for me."
"Those marks of the lotus said to be good angury for women by wise men, have become
meaningless, now that Rama is slain."
"My hair is fine, black in colour and smooth. My eye-brows are disunited. My shanks
are hair-less and well rounded. My teeth are contiguous, without any gaps between them."
"My temples, eyes, arms, feet, ankles and thights are homogenous and
well-proportioned. My fingers have well-rounded and glossy nails, having a right lenght."
"My breasts are close to each other, fully developed and have depressed nipples. My
navel is deeply idented. My flanks and bossom are well-formed."
"My complexion has the sheen of a pearl. The hair on my skin are soft. It is said of
me as endowed with auspicious signs, in that I touched the ground with my twelve limbs (viz. the
ten toes and two soles).
"Those who interpret the marks of youthful maidens spoke of me that my hands and
feet are rosy, fully provided with marks each resembling a barley corn, devoid of space between my
fingers and toes and that my smile is gentle."
"All that was told by brahmins well-versed in sooth-saying, of me that- I should be
consecrated on the imperial throne along with my husband -proved to be in vain."
"Having searched all the resorts of men, received the tidings of my fate, and
crossed the impassable ocean, those two brothers have perishe din the imprint of a cow's hoof ( a
small puddle)."
"Rama and Lakshmana surely knew the use of the arrows of Varuna, Agni, Indra and
Vayu, as also the Brahmashira weapon."
"By means of magic arts, an invisible foe has slain Rama and Lakshmana, my
protectors, who are equal to Indra in battle and I am now bereft of any support."
"Having reached the range of sight of Rama in a combat, no enemy could return alive,
eventhough he were endowed with the swiftness of thought."
There is no burden too heavy for death to shoulder, as Rama along with his brother
are lying struck down on the battle-field. Fate is inexorable."
"I do not repent so much for Rama and Lakshmana or for myself or even my mother but
for my unfortunate mother-in-law, Kausalya."
"Kausalya for her part, forever remains absorbed in the thought 'When shall I see
Lakshmana and Seetha with Rama returned (to Ayodhya) having completed his vow (of remaining in
exile in the forest for fourteen years)?"
The demoness Trijata spoke to that lamenting Seetha as follows : "O, the god-like
lady! Do not despair. Your husband, Rama is still living."
"O, godlike lady! I will tell you mighty and cogent reasons, how these two brothers
Rama and Lakshmana are living."
"The leader having been lost, the faces of the soldiers on the field of battle are
never seized by anger nor are they animated with joy."
"O, Seetha! This aerial car called Pushpaka by name, celestial as it is, would not
have brought you here, if those two heroes have lost their lives."
"An army that sees its valiant commander falll, is bereft of courage and wanders
aimlessly about on the battle field, like a ship which has broken its rudder in water."
"This army for its part is neither confused nor perturbed and is guarding Rama and
Lakshman. I am pointing this out to you on account of my affection for you, O lady given to
austerities!"
"You as such, be reassured by these auspicious omens. Behold Rama and Lakshman who
are not dead. I am telling you this, on account of my affection for you."
"O, Seetha! I have not spoken falsehood before, nor shall I ever do so. By your
conduct and natural gaiety, you have found a place in my heart!"
"Even celestials and demons along with Indra cannot vanquish there two heroes in
battle. This is what I have observed and communicated to you."
"O Seetha!; See this, a great marvel !; See how, fallen under those shafts and
deprived of their senses, thier beauty has not deserted them."
"Generally, the faces of those who lost their lives and whose vital power has
vanished, will be appearing with an appalling alteration".
"O, Seetha! Banish your grief, pain and ignorance on account of Rama and Lakshmana.
It is impossible, now with the splendour seen in their faces, for Rama and Lakshmana to die."
Hearing her words, Seetha, the daughter of Mithila kingdom resembling a daughter of
gods, with joined palms exclaimed, "May it be so."
After sending back that aerial car, Pushpaka which was as swift as the thought, the
sorrowful Seetha was caused by Trijata to enter Lanka once more.
Thereafter, Seetha along with Trijata who descended from Pshpaka the aerial car,
were caused by the female demons, to enter the Ashoka grove again.
Entering that Ashoka grove, planted with a multitude of trees, sporting ground of
Ravana and recalling the two princes who she had just seen, Seetha gave way to extreme grief.Thus spoken to by Seetha, ogresses swooned with anger terribly. Some went to tell that to Ravana 
the evil-minded one.
Thereafter ogresses with a terrible appearance neared Seetha and ten again spoke words of evil purpose, 
with a single meaning and which were harsh.
"O ignoble one! O one with a sinful resolve! O Seetha! Today at this moment ogresses will eat this 
your flesh according to comfort."
Then, seeing Seetha frightened by those evil ones, an ogress named Trijata, sleeping till then, 
spoke these words.
"O evil ones! Eat your selves. You will not eat Seetha who is the dear daughter of king Janaka 
and daughter-in-law of king Dasaratha."
"Now a terrible dream, causing the hairs to stand erect for the destruction of ogres and 
for the welfare of Her husband, has been seen by me."
Thus spoken to by Trijata all ogresses were frightened and spoke to that Trijata these words.
"Of what kind is this dream seen by you. Tell us". Listening to this utterance that came forth 
from the mouths of those ogresses, Trijata spoke at that time this word relating to the dream.
"Rama wearing white garlands and clothes passing through the sky, Himself ascending a palanquin 
made of ivory tied with a thousand swans, arrived along with Lakshmana."
"Now it has been seen by me in the dream that Seetha also wearing white clothes was sitting on 
a white mountain surrounded by the ocean."
"Seetha came together with Rama like the light with the Sun. Rama also was seen by me to be mounted 
on a great elephant with four tusks and equalling a mountain and Rama wandered together with Lakshmana."
"Thereafter shining with their radiance, wearing white garlands and clothes, those two best 
among men Rama and Laksmana neared Seetha."
"Thereafter Seetha rested on the upper part of the back of an elephant in the sky; taken by Her husband 
Rama to the front of that mountain."
"Thereafter it has been seen by me that Seetha with eyes like lotuses has risen from the lap 
of Her husband and gently touched the Moon and the Sun with Her hand."
"Thereafter that best elephant ascended by those princes Rama and Lakshmana and by Seetha with 
wide eyes stood on the top of Lanka."
"Rama together with wife Seetha, Himself came here in a chariot tied with eight white bulls."
"The valorous best among men Rama together with brother Lakshmana and with Seetha ascended wonderful 
Pushpaka aeroplane equalling the Sun, went in the northern direction."
"Rama with strength equalling that of Lord Vishnu, born in Raghu's dynasty together with brother 
Lakshmana and Seetha have been seen by me thus in the dream."
"Rama with great glory is not possible to be defeated by Suras or by ogres or by others like heaven 
not being conquerable by sinners."
"Ravana also was seen by me on earth sprinkled with oil, with red clothes, with garlands tied with 
Oleander flowers, drinking oil and intoxicated."
"Now Ravana fallen on to earth from Pushpaka aeroplane having the head shaved, wearing black 
clothes again was seen to be pulled by a woman."
"Wearing red garlands and unguents, drinking oil, laughing, dancing, with a confused mind, with 
agitated senses, Ravana went by a chariot tied by donkeys."
"Undertaking southern direction, Ravana went quickly by a donkey. Again it was seen me that the 
king of ogres Ravana stupefied with fear, fell from the donkey with head down."
"That Ravana rising quickly, together with perplexity, distressed with fear, excited by passion, 
being naked, like a mad man, prattling many bad words, entering dirt with a bad smell, which was intolerable, 
horrible, dark, like the hell and quickly sank in that."
"A woman with red clothes, who was black, with body smeared with dirt, tying Ravana by the throat, 
was pulling him in the southern direction."
"In that dream, the ogre Kumbhakarna has been seen thus by me. All of Ravana's sons have been seen 
to be sprinkled with oil."
"Ravana by a pig, Indrajit by a porpoise, Kumbhakarna by a camel set out in the southern direction."
"Among those Vibhishana is the only one who has been seen by me to be having a white umbrella, 
wearing white garlands and clothes and anointing body with white unguents."
"Vibhishana is there adorned with the sound of conch shells and kettledrums, with dances and songs, 
ascended the best elephant equalling a mountain with the sound of a thundering cloud, with four tusks. He approached 
the sky together with four ministers"
"An assembly also of ogres drinking oil and wearing red garlands, with red clothes, with the sound 
of songs and musical instruments has been seen by me."
"This beautiful city of Lanka has also been seen together with horses and elephants with broken 
gates and arches have fallen in the ocean."
"Lanka protected by Ravana has been seen by me in the dream to be burnt by a quick Vanara who is 
a messenger of Rama."
"In Lanka horrible with ash, all ogresses were drinking oil, laughing heartily with a great noise 
and also dancing a lot."
"All these best among ogres such as Kumbhakarna and others taking a red cloth entered a hole filled 
with cow dung."
"Go away! Be destroyed! Rama will get Seetha. With a great anger, He will get you killed together 
with other ogres."
"Rama will not approve frightening or threatening His dear wife who is highly valued by Him, who 
followed Him to live in the forest."
"For that reason, enough of cruel words. Gentle words indeed be said. Let us request Seetha. This 
is agreeable to me."
"Which woman while being sorrowful, such type of dream has been seen, that woman being released 
from various sorrows, will get unsurpassed pleasure."
"O ogresses! Entreat Seetha who has been frightened. What is the use of a desire to speak? From 
Rama a horrible fear has come to ogres."
"O ogresses! This Seetha daughter of Janaka, pleased with prostration is competent to protect us 
from great danger. And also I do not see in Her who is wide-eyed, in Her limbs even a minute misshapen characteristic, 
even insignificant one."
"I see an imperfection in complexion alone. I doubt that this princess who came near an aeroplane 
in my dream, who is not suited to sorrows received sorrow."
"I am seeing Seetha coming near accomplishment of motive. I also see the destruction of Ravana 
also and victory of Rama coming near."
"Being a cause to listen to a great pleasure of Her, this throbbing eye long like a lotus petal 
is being seen my me."
"One left arm of this straightforward Seetha suddenly has become erect and is slightly trembling."
"Seetha's best left thigh equal to an elephant's trunk is trembling indicating Rama's standing 
in front of Her."
"A bird also entering its dwelling place on a branch, again and again, speaking best consolating 
words are telling heartily welcoming words being delighted again and again, as though impelling Seetha."Vishvamitra, the son of Kushi, piteously spoke this mellowly sentence to king Trishanku who spoke thus, 
and who in reality attained a state of profaner." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. 
Oh, Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s, you are welcome. I am aware that you are a highly righteous 
king. Oh, the best king, you need not be dismayed, for I accord you haven. 
I will invite all the sages with pious activities who will render assistance in the ritual, oh, king, 
then you can perform the ritual self-composedly. 
You can go to heaven with this body of yours, as well as with the form which is deformed by the curse 
of mentor Vashishta through his sons. 
'I deem that heaven is handy to you, oh, king of subjects, as you have approached the all-sheltering 
Vishvamitra and sought shelter.' Thus Vishvamitra solaced Trishanku. 
On saying thus to Trishanku that great-resplendent Vishvamitra ordered his highly righteous and astutely 
brilliant sons to organise the arrangements for the ritual. 
Vishvamitra calling forth all of his disciples said this sentence, 'oh boys invite all the eminent sages who 
are well-read in many Veda-s, along with their disciples and friends, and their ritwiks, the conductors 
of rituals at my order.' 
'If someone speaks inconsiderately incited by the forcefulness of my word, whoever speaks it, whichever 
word it may be, all that is to be reported to me, whatever it is.' Thus Vishvamitra ordered his disciples. 

On listening that word of Vishvamitra his disciples went to all directions inviting all by his order, 
and then the Vedic scholars started to arrive from all provinces. 
All of the disciples have returned to the fulgently resplendent sage Vishvamitra, and reported the 
words spoken by all the Vedic scholars. 
'On listening your word all the Brahmans from all provinces have started to come and some have already 
come, leaving alone Mahodaya, the son of Vashishta.' Thus, the disciples have started to inform Vishvamitra. 

What all said by those hundred sons of Vashishta is explosively worded in their fury, oh, eminent 
sage, and what all they have said that you may please listen. 
'A Kshatriya is the officiator, and a profaner is the performer. How then the gods or sages can partake 
of the remnants of oblations in that ritual-assembly, especially that of a profaner?' Thus, the sons 
of Vashishta exclaimed. 
Though the Brahmans or the high-souled sages are now embarrassed by Vishvamitra, how can they go 
to heaven even after their demise, partaking of the food of a profaner? 
'Oh, tigerly sage Vishvamitra, all the sons of Vashishta including Mahodaya spoke these derisive sentences 
with their eyes reddening in anger.' Thus, the disciples reported to Vishvamitra. 
The eminent sage Vishvamitra having heard those words of the sons of Vashishta from all of his disciples, 
said this rancorously with bloodshot eyes. 
He who reproves me, who am abiding in rigorous ascesis, and who am an unreprovable one by my ascetic 
merit, that irreverent person will be reduced to ashes, and there is no doubt about it. 
Now they will be dragged by the lasso of Time to the House of Yama, the Terminator, and from now 
to seven hundred births to come they take birth as devourers of corpses, come what may. 
Those who reprove me will be wandering about these mortal worlds on taking birth as disfigured and 
deformed beings in the ruthless sect of Mustika-s that always feed on dog's flesh. 
That wrong-headed Mahodaya also reproached me, who am irreproachable on my part, hence he gets into 
tribal-hood and becomes a reproachable tribal for the entire world. 
By my fury he obtains an utter barbarity and he will be occupied with a murderous bent, and he cycles 
through a worst possible living for a long time. 
On saying this much sentence of curse among the sages who have already arrived, that great-resplendent, 
greatly ascetic, great sage Vishvamitra paused. "On hearing the sentence of Trishanku, oh, Rama, the hundred sons of sage Vashishta infuriately said 
this to that king." Thus, sage Shataananda continued his narration to Rama and others. 
'You slow-witted king, your veracious mentor has denounced you. But transgressing him how do you approach 
another branch of the same tree of wisdom, when that very tree rejected you?' So the sons of Vashishta 
have started to denounce Trishanku. 
'The Royal Priest is the ultimate course for all of Ikshvaku-s, isn't it. It is impossible to transgress 
the word of advise of such a veracious Priest. 
Vashishta is the most reverential sage and such a sage has already said it is impossible to conduct 
such a Vedic-ritual. Then, in which way we are capable to conduct such a Vedic-ritual? 
'Oh king of subjects, better get back to your own city again for you are childish. That godlike Vashishta 
alone is capable to orchestrate any ritual by any king in all the three worlds. Oh, king, how then we 
are capable to cause a disrepute to his reputation.' Thus, the sons of Vashishta refuted Trishanku. 

"On hearing that sentence of theirs which is highly faltering with words of fury that king further spoke 
this sentence to all of them." So Shataananda continued. 
'I am indeed rejected by the godlike Vashishta, likewise even by you, the sons of the same mentor, 
as such oh, ascetically wealthy scholars, in this state obloquy I will resort to another recourse, let 
safety betide you.' So Trishanku bade farewell to the sons of Vashishta, but... 
But the sons of the sage Vashishta, on hearing that sentence of the king, that is inclusive of and 
leading to a calamitous situation, have become very highly infuriated and cursed saying, 'you shall 
get into a state of basely profaner.' That is the curse issued by the sons of Vashishta to Trishanku. 

On saying thus those great-souled sons of Vashishta withdrew to one's own hermitage and when that night 
elapsed into day then the king lapsed into a state of basely profaner. 
He is now wearing blackish cloths which on yestereve were ochry silks, he is now a blackamoor who on 
yestereve was a gilt-royalty, his head-hair is shaggy which earlier was silkily soft, and his royal 
garlands which were richly fragrant are now funeral wreaths, and he is besmeared with crematory ashes 
which were regal emollients, and his royal jewellery is now rendered into iron adornments. 
On seeing him in the mien of a profaner, oh, Rama, all of his ministers and the subjects and his own 
retinue have deserted him and took to flight in masses. 
Though that resolutely self-assured king seethed for one night and day for this mishap, then went to 
the ascetically prosperous Vishvamitra. 
But on seeing at that mien of the king which is rendered to that of a precluded profaner from kingship 
and for officiating rituals etc., oh, Rama, sage Vishvamitra because sympathetic. 
The great-resplendent sage and highly generous Vishvamitra firstly said to that king who is in a terrible 
aspect 'let safety betide you,' and then spoke on this sentence to him. 
'What is the purpose of your visit, oh, great-mighty prince Trishanku, oh, brave lord of Ayodhya, 
you are accurst to the state of profaner.' 
Then that king who is accurst to a state of profaner on listening that sentence, as a diligent sentence 
maker spoke this sentence with his palms adjoined to the sententious sage Vishvamitra. 
I am spurned off by my mentor Vashishta and also like that by his sons. My aspiration remained unachievable, 
besides, this discrepancy has bechanced upon me. 
'Oh, gentle Vishvamitra, my aspiration is nothing but to go to heaven with my body. I have performed 
hundred rituals but I have not achieved the fruit.' Thus Trishanku started tell his sad tale.
And now if you doubt me to be a liar, I am no liar either. I spoke no lie heretofore, and even if 
I were to land into any predicament I do not speak lies anytime hereinafter. Oh, gentle sage, this I 
pledge you upon my virtue of Kshatriya-hood. 
I have propitiated gods with many kinds of Vedic-rituals. I have reigned over people conscientiously. 
And with my conduct and comport the high-souled savants are also pleased. 
While I am a pursuant in probity I expect to avail myself of the fruition of this kind of Vedic-ritual. 
Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, but my mentors are not deriving complete contentment by my pursuit. Hence, 
they shove me off. 
I deem destiny is the only ultimate, and manly efforts are meaningless, for destiny surmounts everything. 
Destiny is the ultimate course, isn't it? 
A highly anguished endeavourer, marred by destiny, a sincere requester, such as I am, it will be 
apt of you to accord, you be safe, your favour upon me. 
" 'In no alternate course I wish to course through and no alternative shelter is there for me. Hence, 
it will be apt of you, a god in man's mien, to countervail my destiny.' Thus Trishanku prayed for the 
grace of Vishvamitra..." So said Sage Shataananda to Rama and others continuing the legend of Vishvamitra. 
"The great-resplendent Vishvamitra on knowing through his ascetic power about the ruination of the sons 
of Vashishta, along with Mahodaya, proclaimed this amidst the observance of sages." Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Trishanku's legend. 
'This legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty is well-know as Trishanku, a righteous and benevolent one. He came 
under my shelter as he wishes to win over the heaven of gods with his own mortal body.' So Vishvamitra 
started to speak to sages. 
'You all scholars have to conduct Vedic-ritual along with in such a way as to how Trishnaku reaches 
the heaven of gods.' Thus Vishvamitra advised the conductors of the ritual. 
On listening the words of Vishvamitra all those great-sages have come together and quickly discussed 
among themselves about what is agreeable to righteousness, as they are the knowers of scruples of conducting 
Vedic-rituals, but such a ritual is desultory. 
Whatever Vishvamitra says let it be translated entirely and exhaustively into deeds called ritual. 
This Vishvamitra is the legatee of Sage Kushi, and indeed he is a saint similar to Ritual-fire besides 
being an extremely furious person. Otherwise this awesome sage gives curse, rancorously. 
'As such, let the Vedic-ritual be conducted intending and enabling Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku, 
to go to heaven by the ritualist prowess of Vishvamitra, therefor you conduct yourselves and you all 
preside over it.' Thus, the officiators conceded among themselves. 
Concluding thus those great-sages undertook concerned works of that Vedic-ritual and the great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra himself became its principal officiator. 
Those hymnodists who are the experts in hymnodies have scripturally carried out all ceremonies 
in a methodical way with inviolable hymnal methods, and as per Kalpa treatise, that lays down the rules 
for conducting such rituals. 
After a long time that highly ascetical Vishvamitra welcomed all the gods to receive their allotted 
oblations in that ritual. 
Then all of the gods who are invited to partake of the oblation have not come forward to receive their 
allotments, and then the great-saint Vishvamitra, obsessive with fury, furiously lifted up a wooden-oblational-scoop, 
and said this to Trishanku. 
Oh, ruler of people, now you shall see the potency of my ascesis which I personally achieved. Such 
as I am I shall lead you forth to haven with your own body just by my personal capability. Oh, king 
of people, now you will go to heaven with your own mortal body, which is otherwise unattainable. 
'May it be a little, but there is some fruit of my ascesis, isn't it! Oh, king, you will journey to 
heaven with your own body owing to that prowess of my ascesis.' Vishvamitra said so to Trishanku. 
"Once the sage Vishvamitra said those words, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, that king Trishanku soared to heaven 
with his mortal body, before the very eyes of other sages." Sage Shataananda continued. 
On seeing Trishanku's entry into the realm of heaven, Indra, the subjugator of demon Paaka, spoke this 
sentence together with all the multitudes of gods. 
Oh, Trishanku, you have not yet made heaven as your haunt, hence retrace your steps. As you are thrashed 
by the damning of your mentor Vashishta, you inane human, again fall down on earth, but with your head 
inversed. 
When Mahendra said so, Trishanku loudly exclaiming at the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra saying, 'save 
me, save me,' and fell down from heaven. 
On hearing the exclamatory sentence of Trishanku who is shouting it loudly, Vishvamitra assumed an 
abnormal anger and also said, 'wait... wait...' 
Like the other Creator that resplendent Vishvamitra, himself staying among sages, has replicated Southerly 
Ursa Major in southerly direction. And still remaining amidst of sages that highly reputed sage Vishvamitra 
further started to replicate the stereotyped stocks of stars sequentially, resorting to the southern 
hemisphere, as he is convulsed in anger at Indra. 
On replicating the stereotyped stocks of other galaxies and stars, and while fury continued to blemish 
him Vishvamitra said, 'I will now clone an alternative Indra, or let that realm created by me remain 
without any Indra,' and when he is about to proceed to clone even gods in his wrath, the gods are startled. 

The gods are highly startled at Vishvamitra's creation, and they along with demons and with observances 
of hermits addressed the great-souled Vishvamitra with placatory words. 
'Oh great-fortunate Vishvamitra, this king Trishnaku is damned by his mentor, hence oh, ascetically 
wealthy sage, he is not at all eligible to go to heaven with his mortal body.' So said gods to Vishvamitra. 

On hearing that sentence of those gods, the eminent saint Kaushika spoke this highly laudable sentence 
to all of the gods. 
Let safety betide you all. I have promised to this king Trishanku that he will ascend to heaven with 
his mortal body, and I am not interested to make it untrue. 
'Let there be eternal heaven to Trishanku with his mortal body. Next, as along as the worlds remain, 
let all of these stars and galaxies I have created also remain eternally in their places as my creation. 
It will be apt of you all gods to accede to this.' So said Vishvamitra to gods. 
When all the gods are addressed thus they replied the eminent saint Vishvamitra saying, 'so be it! 
Safe you be! Let all the created objects prevail in their respective places. Those amazing and numerous 
stars you have created will remain in firmament, but outside the path of stelliform of Cosmic Person. 
Trishanku will also remain in the circle of stars you created, but upside-down, for Indra's indict cannot 
be annulled, and he will be gleaming like a star and similar to any celestial. 
'According to their wont to circumambulate someone who has gone to heavenly worlds, all the stars 
will suppliantly circumambulate this best king Trishanku, who has achieved his ends and who has become 
an acclaimed one with your tour de force.' So said gods to Vishvamitra in deterring his further cloning 
of a simulative Universe. 
Even the benign-souled Vishvamitra, when reverenced by all gods, that great-resplendent sage without 
stirring himself from among the sages said to all gods, 'Agreed!' 
Oh, best one among men Rama, later at the end of that ritual great-souled gods and ascetically wealthy 
sages went away as they have come. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the narration of the legend. That very strong and powerful Rama the son of Dasaratha ordered ten monkey-generals to 
search for the whereabouts of Indrajit.
Rama the scourger of his enemies ordered both the sons of Sushena, Nila the chief of 
monkeys, Angada the son of Vali, the stron Sharabha, Dvivida, Hanuman, the very strong Sanuprastha, 
Rishabha and Rishabha skandha.
All those monkeys, thrilled with enthusiasm, flung into the air brandishing huge trunks 
of trees in order to explore the ten regions.
Indrajit, the son of Ravana, who was skilled in the use of magic weapons, by means of 
his arrows with great speed, released from his most excellent of bows, arrested the impetuous outbreak 
of the monkeys.
Those monkeys of terrific bound, whose bodes were cruelly pierced by those shafts, were 
unable to see Indrajit in the darkness, as the sun is obscured when veiled in clouds.
Indrajit, the victorious in battle, transfixed Rama and Lakshmana with those arrows that 
lacerated their flesh in great measure.
The bodies of both those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana were densely transfixed with serpentine 
arrows by the enraged Indrajit.
Blood flowed from the wound-marks of both Rama and Lakshmana and both of them shone like 
Kimshuka trees in flowring.
At that instant, though still invisible, Indrajit, Ravana's son, with his inflamed eyes, 
which resembled a mass of collyrium mixed with oil, spoke the following words to those two brothers.
"When I enter into combat, making myself invisible, even Indra the lord of celestials 
is not able to see or approach me. How much less, you two!"
"O, Descendents of Raghu! Having imprisoned you in this net work of arrows furnished 
with heron's feathers, I, yielding myself up to the violence of my wrath, am about to dispatch you to 
the region of Yama the Lord of Death."
Speaking thus to the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, who were aware of righteousness, Indrajit 
pierced them with pointed arrows and shouted too exultantly.
Indrajit, who was as black as a heap of shattered collyrium, stretching his immense bow, 
discharged formidable arrows even once more, in that great fight.
That warrior, Indrajit, who was aware of their vital parts, set up a continual shouting, 
digging sharp arrows into the vital parts of Rama and Lakshmana.
Those two princes, in the forefront of battle, bounded by that net work of arrows in 
the twinkling of an eye, became incapable of even looking up.
Pierced in their vital parts, exhausted, and covered all over with heads of arrows, those 
two mighty and courageous archers fell to the earth, they who were the lords of the earth, shaking violently 
like a pair of flag-staffs in honour of Indra the Lord celestials and freed from their raised of chords.
Those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, lying on that heroes' bed (on the battle-ground), 
bathed in blood, all their limbs bristling with arrows and extremely injured, felt distressed.
There was not a finger's breadth on their bodies form the tips of their fingers to the 
end of their feet that was not lacerated, implanted and pierced by those arrows.
Struck down by that ferocious demon, who was able to change his shape at will, the hot 
blood gushed forth from both Rama and Lashmana, as water from a spring.
Rama fell first, his vital parts pierced by arrows of the wrathful Indrajit, who had 
formerly vanquished Indra the Lord of celestials.
Indrajit pierced Rama by arrows with golden shafts, with sharp points, which had downward 
movement, which go fast, Narchas, Demi-narachas, Bhallas (with wide tips), Anjalis, Vatsa dantas, Simha 
dantas and those shafts like unto razors.
Throwing asunder his bow bent at three places, adorned with gold, with its string loosened 
away and detached from the hold of his fist, Rama lied down on the battle-ground.
Seeing Rama the excellent man fallen, at a distance of an arrows range, Lakshman became 
hopeless about his own life.
Seeing his elder brother Rama, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, having fallen on 
the ground, wounded as he was by a net work of arrows, Lakshmana felt sad.
Beholding that Rama, the monkeys too were in great grief and wept terribly, with their 
eyes filled in tears, being afflicted as they were by sorrow.
Those monkeys with Hanuman in first place gathered at a place and stood surrounding Rama 
and Lakshmana, who wee bound by a net work of arrows and lying down on the battle ground. They were 
disturbed and afflicted sorrow.The devastation of his army through Angada's prowess filled the mighty Vajradamstra
with anger.
Stretching his terrific bow, like unto Indra's thunder bolt, he assailed the monkey
battalions with a flood of arrows.
Then, the foremost of the demons mounted on chariots, fought the battle with every
kind of weapon.
The monkeys, those valiant bulls among the Plavagas, assembling on all sides, fought
with rocks.
Then in that battle there, the demons abundantly hurled thousands of weapons on the
foremost of monkeys.
The monkeys of mighty prowess, resembling elephants in rut, showered down giant
trees and huge lumps of rock on the demons.
Between those courageous warriors, the demons and the monkeys, who never retreated
in battle, a tremendous struggle ensued.
Some monkeys and demons, with their shattered heads, but bereft of arms and legs,
lay on the earth bathed in blood with their bodies wounded by weapons, a prey to herons vultures
and crows or devoured by troops of jackals.
Monkeys and demons fell on the battle-field; headless trunks leaps up to the terror
of all the fearful, their limbs hacked to pieces in the combat.
Thereafter, under the eyes of Vajradamshtra, all his army of demons were killed and
broken up by the monkey-troops.
Seeing the demons terrified with fear and decimated by the monkeys, that powerful
Vajradamshtra, his eyes red with anger, bow in hand, penetrated the army of monkeys, sowing panic
among them.
Thereafter, in his fury, the vigorous Vajradamshtra dispatched those monkeys with
arrows resembling wings of an eagle that flew straight to their target and pierced seven, eight,
nine or five of his opponents simultaneously, thus destroying them.
With their limbs crippled by those arrows and frightened, those monkey battalions
sought refuge with Angada, as all creatures with Brahma the Lord of Creation.
When he beheld those monkey troops fleeing in disorder, Angada the son Vali
exchanged glances of hatred with Vajradamshtra.
Both Vajradamshtra and Angada fought against each other like a lion and an elephant
in rut. They strolled din a tremendous fury.
Thereafter, that Vajradamshtra knocked the mighty Angada at his vital organs with
his arrows resembling hundred thousand flames of fire.
With all his limbs drenched in blood, the mighty Angada having a terrific prowess
threw a tree on Vajradamshtra.
That unperplexed demon, seeing that tree falling on him, cut it into innumerable
pieces which fell in heaps on earth.
Witnessing the strength of Vajradamshtra, Angada that lion among the monkeys seized
hold of a large rock and emitting a shout, threw it on him.
As the rock descended, that vigorous Vajradamshtra leaping down from his chariot,
armed with his mace, stood waiting unperplexed, on the battle-field.
Meanwhile, the rock thrown by Angada, falling into the forefront of the battle, then
crushed the chariot with its wheels shafts and horses
Thereafter, Angada the monkey, seizing another large peak of a mountain adorned with
trees, threw it on Vajradamshtra's head.
Beginning to vomit blood, Vajradamshtra became fainted, clenching his mace
convulsively and breathing heavily for a moment.
Regaining his consciousness, Vajradamshtra the demon was very much enraged and hit
Angada full on the chest with his mace.
Leaving his mace, he performed a pugilistic encounter there. Both the monkey and the
demon thus hit each other in that combat.
Exhausted by the blows, spitting blood, those valiant warriors were like the planets
Mars and Mercury.
Then, Angada the lion among the monkeys, possessing a great splendour, uprooted a
tree full with many flowers and fruits and stood waiting.
The demon too seized hold of a shield covered with the hide of a bull as well as a
great beautiful sword decorated richly with a multitude of golden bells.
Thirsting for victory, the monkeys and the demons, making roaring sounds, roamed
about in different ways and collided with each other.
With their gaping wounds, they shone like a pair of kimshuka trees in blossom.
Exhausted were both of them while fighting and they sank their knees on the earth.
Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, just after a moment, with his glittering eyes,
rose up like a serpent struck with a stick.
The mighty Angada assaulted the giant head of Vajradamshtra with a well-sharpened
and stainless sword.
Struck by the sword, that charming head of Vajradamshtra, with his limbs drenched in
blood and eyes rolling, fell into two pieces.
Seeing Vajradamshtra having been slain, the demons, deluded with fear, fled
panic-stricken towards Lanka, harassed by the monkeys with their down-cast faces, their heads bowed
in shame.
The mighty Angada experienced a great joy amidst the monkey forces, honoured by them
for his high courage and he resembled the Lord of a Thousand Eyes surrounded by the celestials.With his life force slowing down Vali respired slowly glancing everywhere, and he
firstly saw his brother Sugreeva afore him. 
Vali nodding at Sugreeva, who achieved triumph and became the lord of fly-jumpers,
amicably spoke this to him in an unambiguous tone."Sugreeva, reckon me not by my iniquities but reckon as one who is all the while
forcibly hauled into this futurity owing to my impropriety and obduracy. "I do not think that we two are fated to share blissfulness simultaneously, oh, boy,
therefore the amity seemly to brothers has cropped up otherwise.
"You realize that I am going to the abode of Time-god now itself, and hence propose
yourself as king of this forest-dweller kingdom, now itself.
"Such as I am, I am indeed forgoing my life, kingdom, and this immense prosperity
and even the unenviable glory which adduces that 'Vali is unkillable,' right away. 
"Oh, valiant Sugreeva, it will be apt of you to make happen the word I am going to
say even in such a situation in which now I am, and oh, king, even if that word of mine is
infeasible. 
"Have a look at this Angada, who is privileged for all happiness, brought up in all
comforts, though a boy he is mannerly, and who with his tear-filled face fallen onto the ground.

"More dear than my own lives is my son, and when he is deprived of me you have to
foster him as if he is your son, with no resources becoming sparse in every way. "Oh, king of fly-jumpers, as with me you too are his father, patron, an overall
protector from all sides, and also thus an assurer in fear. 
"This admirable son of Tara is a coequal of yours in triumphs, and in eliminating
those demons he will be in your advance guard. "This mighty and sinewy son of Tara is youthful, and on overtaking in war this
Angada will undertake actions seemly for a son of mine. 
"In deciding meanings in all their subtleties and also in presages of diverse nature
this daughter of Sushena, Tara, is an insightful one in every way. "Whatever is said by her as proper is doable indubitably, indeed nothing
contrary happens to her opinions, in the least.
"You have to accomplish Raghava's mission undoubtedly, and if it is unaccomplished
there will be an infraction on your part because you befriended him before an altar of fire, and you
may even be punished for dishonouring him and your given word to him.
"The bounteous goddess of triumph ensconced in this golden pendant will completely
leave it off on my death, avoiding the flaw of touching a corpse, isn't it... hence oh, Sugreeva,
you wear it." Thus Vali spoke to Sugreeva. 
Thus, that way when Vali spoke to Sugreeva with brotherly kind-heartedness, Sugreeva
again waned away forgoing his spiritedness, like the lord of stars, namely the Moon, when eaten
away by the planet, namely Rahu, during a lunar eclipse. Quieted by Vali's words and conducting himself befittingly and attentively in the
given situation, Sugreeva has then taken that golden chain only when Vali authorised him.

On giving away that golden pendant, and on seeing his son who is available nearby,
readying himself towards the end that is setting in, Vali affectionately spoke to Angada.

"From now on, observing time and place you have to tolerate pain or pleasure, endure
mirth or misery on your going under the control of Sugreeva. 
"Oh dextrous Angada, as to how I have entertained you in whichever way you conducted
yourself with me, Sugreeva may not approve of such puerile behaviour of yours, if you resort to
it. 
"Do not reach his unfriendly ones, nor come near his enemies, oh, enemy-destroyer
Angada, you shall be in the control of Sugreeva attending to the purposes of your lord with
self-control. 
"Do not conduct yourself with excessive friendliness or unfriendliness, as this pair
of opposites itself has a flaw, therefore you cultivate an intermediary outlook." Vali thus spoke
to Angada. He who is highly tortured by the arrow of Rama spoke to Angada in that way, and
afterwards, his eyeballs rolled up, mouth hung open baring his horrid teeth, and his life too took
to flight from his body. 
Then, all those best monkeys available there started to weep when their monkey
chief died, and for that matter, they loudly squawked at his death in this way.

"When the lord of monkeys departed to heaven Kishkindha is indeed rendered derelict,
dreary are the gardens, deserted are the mountains and forests as well, and when the tiger among
fly-jumpers is dead all the vanara-s are rendered up into a lacklustre life. 
"And by the impetus of whose great rapidity flowers available in forests and
woodlands used to shower on him in torrents and enwreathe him from behind, that Vali is no more,
and now who has got such an impetus? 
"By which great-souled Vali a ferocious duel was given to the celestial, namely the
great armed Golabha, which did not cease either in the daytime or night till Vali felled Golabha,
that Vali is no more.
"Thereafter, in the sixteenth year, Vali unquestionably felled Golabha, and on
killing that evil-minded Golabha with his zigzag teeth Vali accorded fearlessness to all of us, how
such a Vali is felled now?" Thus the monkeys raised hue and cry. But when that fly-jumper's brave lord Vali is killed, those fly-jumpers have gone
into franticness in that matter of Vali's killing, as with the cows becoming frenetic when their
husbanding bull is killed while moving in a great forest that is riddled with a lion. But then Tara, whelmed under an ocean called affliction closely observed her dead
husband's face, embraced him and collapsed onto the ground as with any creeper plant when the giant
tree on which it is hinging is hacked down.While a similar disquiet of Sugreeva is prevailing over Rama and Lakshmana, Rama palliatively said this to Sugreeva, and even to Tara together with Angada.

"Deceased will not derive bliss by sorrowful mourning, hence it will be appropriate to arrange for that work which is subsequent in this matter.

"Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, but after the lapse of time of any individual, it is impossible to activate that individual by any other remote activity like weeping.

"Fate is the cause of all the worlds, Fate is the instrument for action, Fate is the deciding factor for motivation of all beings in these worlds.

"None is an instrument in motivating someone else to do something or otherwise, none is also a controlling entity of others, and even the world functions in its nature, and that Time is cardinal for that world.

"Time will not transcend Time, neither Time transgresses itself, and on attaining the nature endowed by Time nothing can overstep its own Fate.

"Time has no kinship, thus it has no partiality, there is nothing instrumental to override Time, hence nothing can override it, and there are no causative factors to Time that connect through friends or relatives, hence all are equal in its viewpoint.

"But even the mutations brought forth by Time are observable by a perceiver with a clear vision, and the virtue, wealth, pleasures are to be perceived as cumulated over time.

"That king of fly-jumpers Vali departed from here on attaining his nature of the subtle soul, and he obtained pious fruits connected with his one-time actions befitting to a king like, friendliness, courteousness, and forgivingness required of a king.

"That great-souled Vali did not care to safeguard his own lives in combat, and by his rightness of a true combatant unworried of his life, he acquired heaven.

"Which course the commander of monkeys undertook is the choicest course of fatality, and hence, enough is this sorrowing, and let works incumbent on the present time be undertaken reverently..." So said Rama to Sugreeva.

At the close of Rama's sentence Lakshmana, the eliminator of braving foes, spoke this courteous sentence to the disconcerted Sugreeva.

"Sugreeva, you attend to the funeral rites, to be performed subsequently along with those two, Tara and Angada, and arrange for the cremation of Vali.

"Order at once for substantial dry firewood, likewise for finest sandalwood, for the exequies of Vali.

"Bolster up that miserable Angada who is heartbroken, you too should not become frivolous in thinking as this city Kishkindha is now dependant on you.

"Let Angada bring wreaths, different cloths, ghee, oils, as well perfumes and other items that are consequently useful in the funeral.

"And Lt. Tara, you go quickly and come readily fetching a palanquin of the dead, for despatch is a merit, which is truly worthwhile, especially at these times.

"Let suitable, proficient, and sturdy Vaanara-s be at the ready as the bearers of the litter of the dead to carry away Vali." Thus said Lakshmana to Sugreeva.

Speaking thus to Sugreeva that enhancer of his mother Sumitra's delight and the eliminator of braving foes, Lakshmana stepped off and stayed behind his brother Rama.

On hearing the words of Lakshmana Lt. Tara's mood became hectic and he fleetly entered Kishkindha with his mood firmed up to get the litter of the dead.

Lt. Tara came back in a trice fetching that litter of the dead, getting it carried by gritty and suitable Vanara-s.

That palanquin has a majestic throne and in similarity, it is like a divine chariot which is adorned and beautified with figurines of birds and trees in high relief. From all over it is well set in with strikingly carved figures of foot soldiers, and it is like an aircraft of the gifted souls, namely siddha-s, with grills and ventilators. Well, seamed-in are its parts and also spacious it is, and well crafted by the crafty craftsmen it has wooden play-hills carved in its walls, and finishing touches with a fine artistry of polishing are given to that palanquin. It is elaborated with the best ornaments and strings of pearls, gems, beads, and the like, and even with amazing flowery tassels. Its cabin's roof is covered with ornamental woodcraft of red sandalwood. It is well covered with lots of flowers, and in its shade, it is like a tender sun, while garlands of red lotuses are further brightening it. And Lt. Tara brought such a litter of the dead.

On seeing such a sort of palanquin Rama said to Lakshmana, "Let Vali be taken away quickly and a funeral ceremony is undertaken."

Thereafter Sugreeva along with Angada and others lifted up and then lodged Vali in the litter of the dead squalling woefully.

Thus setting the deceased Vali who is diversely decorated and adorned with garlands and cloths onto the palWhen Rama's arrow hit him then Vali, the scourger in war, suddenly fell like a hewed-down tree. 

He glittered with pure golden ornaments, and Vali fell on earth while all of his limbs sank 
to dust, like the flag of Indra when released from its ropes. 
On the fall of that lord of hosts of monkeys and bears onto the earth, unilluminated is the earth like the 
welkin that has forsooth lost its moon.
Though that great-souled Vali fell onto the earth, neither his brilliance, nor lives, nor resplendence, 
nor his bravery is unfettering from his body. 
That superb and gem-studded golden pendant given by Indra sustained that monkey chief's life, resplendence 
and brilliance. 
By still wearing that golden chest pendant around his neck, that brave general of monkeys Vali appeared 
like a black cloud smeared with the colour of a golden sunset all around its edges. 
Even though Vali has fallen on the ground his splendour is as though refulgent devising itself into three 
aspects, namely by his body, chest pendant, and the arrow of Rama, which arrow is given to strike the 
crucial body parts alone, and which are still stuck in Vali's chest. 
That arrow which effectuates the pathway to heaven, now discharged from the bow of Rama has brought 
forth that redemption to brave Vali.
Then on seeing him who has fallen in war, the one with the golden pendant, enormously chested, mightily 
armed, face golden, eye greenish, but who is like a fire extinct of its flame; who is like Indra in 
unassailability and like Upendra in indomitability; and who like Yayaati who has fallen from heaven, 
as well as the sun who falls onto Earth from solar orbit when Time-ender flings him at the end of 
era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by 
Lakshmana. 
On seeing the brave Vali fallen like that, who by now is like fire with extinguished tongues of flames, 
and who is seeing droopily, those two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, neared him with due honour. 

On seeing Rama and the great mighty Lakshmana as well, he who fell to the ground flatly hurt by an arrow, and 
whose energy and lives are trifling and vigour trivialised thereby, that Vali spoke these sarcastic 
words in his proper pride to Rama, who is taking pride in this conflict as a victor, which words at 
At the same time have meaning, politeness, and self-righteousness. 
"You are a renowned prince with pleasing looks.. but, which kind of death I am getting now, that too 
when I was in the commotion of conflict with another, alas, that ignoble death is owing to you, and 
what merit is achieved by you in this undertaking of yours to kill someone who is facing away from you... 

"Rama is high-born, they say, gifted with mightiness, resplendent, pursuer of vows, mindful of mercy, 
delighter in people's welfare, sympathetic, greatly enthusiastic and assertively committed to doing 
good deeds, knower of time-and-action, all these living beings on earth are thus relating your renown, 
aren't they?
"To be able to control senses and will, forgiveness, conscientiousness, resoluteness, truthfulness, 
and adventurousness, oh, king, are the aptitudes of a king, and even punishing the wrongdoers, too. 

"Concluding that those kingly characteristics will be obtainable in you, and even judging by the noble 
dynasty of yours, I have confronted Sugreeva though Tara dissuaded me. 
"When you have not appeared before me when I confronted Sugreeva my concept was, 'it will be inapt of 
Rama to hurt me while I am combating another combatant, besides, when I will be unvigilant in that 
fight...' 
"Not knowing that your soul is put to death, not knowing that you are the unrighteous flag bearer of righteousness, 
to me not knowing that you are insidious like straw covered well. 
"I do not know that you are a sinner, one in the garb of a benign soul, and explicitly mantled 
under the garb of probity like ash-covered fire. 
"I am non-guilty as I have not committed any misdeed either in your country or in your city, or I have 
taunted you; I am a vanara subsisting on fruits and tubers and always moving in forests alone; such 
as I am, what made you torture me when I was not combating your face, furthermore, when I 
was involved with another? 
"You are renowned to be a prince with charming looks, oh, king, and indications agreeable to rectitude 
are also appearing on your body. 
"Will anybody born in Kshatriya's family, a learned one in Veda-s, thereby who is rid of ambiguities 
concerning right and wrong, and who is cloaked in an air of probity, execute such a ruthless deed 
like this?
"Though born in Raghava's dynasty and renowned as a moralist you are amoral, and for what purpose 
Do you run around with this moral aspect? 
"Influencing, largesse, forbearance, probity, candour, and conquering are the attributes of the kings, 
oh, king, and even punishing the wrongdoers. 
"We as animals live in forests while you are city dwellers, we live by eating fruits and tubers while 
you enjoy feasts and banquets, our nature is such to kill and get killed, thus you and I do not correlate. 
And you, even if you are a man and a prince for humans, you resorted to this animalistic way of killing 
me lying in the wait, thus your action is worse than that of an animal, if not subhuman or un-princely. 
"Territory, gold, and silver will be the causes while counteracting somebody, in that case, by what 
you are decoyed into these forests of mine or in the fruits of mine. 
"In the pairs of propriety and compliance, punishment and pardoning, no admixture is exercised in kingcraft, 
for the kings do not conduct themselves volitionally. 
"But, to you your self-interests are primary, and you are a wrathful, capricious, contriver of kingcraft 
and an impetuous shooting-happy archer.
"Oh, king, you have no devotion to probity, nor your mind is firm about material gains, but as a free-willed 
one you are distracted by senses.
"How you are answerable to gentlemen, Rama, when you have done this detestable deed of killing an unoffending 
one like me with your arrow? 
"A regicide, a Brahman-cide, a cow-slayer, a thief, an inveterate killer, an atheist, and a younger 
brother who marries before his elder, all of them will go to hell. "A slander-monger, skinflint, friend-killer and one who makes love with his teacher's wife, they all 
go to the worlds of evil souls, no doubt about it. 
"My skin is unwearable, holy people forbid my hair and bones, and uneatable is my meat for your kind 
of reputable people. 
"Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind 
of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s. 
"Sensible people will not touch my skin and bones, oh, king, nor meats from my body are to be eaten, 
such as I am, a five-nailed animal, I am killed. 
"Though Tara appraised me with truthful and favourable words, I just disregarded her advice owing to 
my delusion and went into the control of Time.
"With you as her espouser, the Earth is not with a correct spouse, as with any lady who is with full-fledged 
chastity, but with a husband who is without rectitude. 
"How are you borne to that great-souled Dasharatha when you are artful, felonious, knavish, disposed 
to a false modesty subconsciously, and an evildoer? 
"I am killed by an elephant called Rama that snapped off its girdle-cord called tradition, that infringed 
the conventions of righteous people, and that discarded the goad called virtue. "On accomplishing this sort of unpropitious, unjustified killing, which is condemned by the righteous 
people, what can you say when you meet the godly men? 
"The valour that which is displayed on the unprejudiced few like us, oh, Rama, I do not see that sort 
of valour is shown by you in respect of your enemies. 
"Had you been in combat with me en face oh, prince, you would have been killed by me and by now you 
would have seen the death-god Yama? 
"An unassailable one, such as I am, I am killed by you while you remained invisible on the field of 
fight, as with a sinner bitten by a snake while he is asleep.
"For which purpose I am killed, intending to do good to Sugreeva is incidental to it, you should have 
assigned me for that purpose in the first instance itself, and I would have brought that evil-minded 
demon Ravana, the abductor of your wife in one day, that too without killing him in any fight, but by 
fastening him by the neck, and I would have presented Maithili to you.
"I would have brought Maithili at your order even if she is lodged in oceanic waters or nether worlds, 
as with the White Horse of Vedic lore. 
"The fact of Sugreeva's getting the kingdom after my going to heaven is proper, but the fact of your 
killing me in war, unrighteously, is improper. 
"Admittedly the world is this way, and if possible a relevant reply may gently be thought of about your 
propriety in killing me..." So said Vali to Rama. 
That great-souled son of a vanara king Vali, whom the arrow impaled and agonised, on keenly seeing Rama 
whose resplendence equals the brightness of the sun, said that much and remained silent when his mouth 
has dried up. ZThe godly saint Valmiki composed Ramayana on Rama's retrieving kingdom, wording admirably 
and meaningfully. 
Sage Valmiki said Ramayana in twenty four thousand verses, in five hundred chapters, in six 
books, likewise an end-piece too. 
Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint 
thought over thus 'really, who will render all this ballad...' 
Then Lava and Kusha who are in the attire of hermits have touched the feet of that contemplative 
soul Valmiki, who is now thoughtful. 
Glorious Kusha and Lava are the virtue knowing princes, and they are endowed with melodious 
voice, besides being the residents of the same hermitage, thus Valmiki saw them saluting at 
his feet. 
On seeing that pair intellectuals who are proficient in Veda-s that self-reliant sage Valmiki 
made those two to memorize the epic, as the epic Ramayana is composed only to reinforce the 
import of Veda-s, as an ancillary. 
That sage with observed sacred vows has rendered the entire epic in the name of 'Ramayana', 
'Sublime Legend of Seetha' and 'elimination of Ravana'. 
To read or to sing it is melodious, adaptable to music with three scales and sevenfold tune, 
and orchestral to the tunes of string-instrument and rhythm included... 
Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung 
 
They are conversant with the art of music and proficient with the pitch and pausing their 
voices, and those two brothers have not only a wealthy voice, but they also look like celestial 
singers. 
They have charm in their appearance and melodiousness in their voice, they are like the two 
reflections of one original object, and thus they came out from the body of Rama, separately. 

They the princes have memorized that virtue-expounding epic, the best; in its entirety and 
in doing so, they rendered that epic faultlessly. 
They sung the epic as schooled, well aware of its content and intent, among the assemblages 
of sages, scholars and also of eminent persons, with their best concentration 
Once those two great-souls who endowed with musical talent and with all remarkable features, 
sung this epic, standing nearby the midst of a gathering of sages and pious souls. 
On hearing that, the eyes of all the sages were overspread with tears of happiness, and they 
appreciated saying, 'splendid, splendid is this...' 
All those saints being the saint-patrons of virtue are pleased at heart, and praised the praiseworthy 
Kusha and Lava, while they are singing. 
"The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... though this has 
happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... 
"On getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, that too melodiously 
and rapturously, marinating the pitch and tune..." So said the saints. 
While the great saints of blessed ascesis are appreciating that way, those two melodiously 
sang very effectually and very meaningfully. 
And someone, a pleased saint, got up and bestowed a handy vessel to them... another reputed 
sage, lauding them contributed a jute robe. 
And another sage bestowed a black-deerskin, and like that yet another a sacred thread... someone 
gave a water-pot and another great saint a girdle of maunja grass to singers, while that way 
another contributed an under cloth; another sage gladly contributed a hatchet to them, another 
a saffron clothe, and yet another saint bestowed a cloth-wrapper; another delivered tuft-headband 
also, and another enchanted for their singing ballad handed out a sacrificial vessel, and 
another a bundle of firewood sticks, and yet another gave a plank-seat of audambari wood, 
and other called forth blessings, and someone then happily chanted bless-hymns for longevity... 
there by all the truth-avowing saints, those that are great sages have thus bestowed boons. 

"Surprising is this well-said rendering of Valmiki... it is the subsistence for tomorrow's 
poets... and this is completed sequentially, as well... 
While this song that generates longevity and prosperity, and one that is melodious one to 
all ears is being sung everywhere in streets and king's ways and while those two singers who 
are experts in singing any kind of music are being appreciated everywhere, Rama has seen them. 

Then on seeing them Rama, the enemy-eliminator, fetched those honour-worthy bothers, Lava 
and Kusha, to his palace and honoured them. 
He that king Rama is then surrounded by his ministers and brothers that are sitting his nearby, 
he himself sat on a divine golden throne. 
Having seen the mannerly brothers endowed with beautiful features, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, 
and Shatrughna, and Bharata likewise. 
Rama said to thus, "Let this ballad be keenly heard from these divinely resplendent brothers, 
for it contains versatile words and meanings...' and thus he motivated the singers. 
Even those two singers have sung the ballad melodiously and effectually, with their clear 
and clarified voices, like the melody of string and rhythmic instruments, with very clear 
and meaningful intonation. 
Enthralling courtier's bodies, minds and hearts also, and thus that song shone forth as it 
is for all ears, bearing a comfort in its manifestation, among the gathering of the people. 

"These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who also possess kingly features, but they are great 
hermits... this narration is endowing good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious 
legend "  
Then those two singers, motivated by Rama's words, sang the ballad in maarga system, for they 
are well versed in it, then even Rama, who is also in the congregation, again to pacify his 
mind,  became interested at heart  Sage Valmiki goes to river Tamasa for a bath and sees a couple of birds, of which a hunter 
kills one. Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, 
of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, 
the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic 
of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him.
Then, the great sage Valmiki, a skilled orator and a virtue-minded one, having heard those words of Narada, 
		worshipped him along with disciples. 
That divine sage Narada being worshipped befittingly by Valmiki in that way, on seeking 
permission of Valmiki to leave and having been permitted by Valmiki, went away heaven-ward. 

Then, on Narada's going to the world of gods in a trice, that sage Valmiki went to the banks of Tamasa river not far from Jahnavi river. 
Then that sage Valmiki on reaching the shore of the clean Tamasa, and on beholding a ford of that river, spoke to his disciple who was at his side. 
"Oh! Bharadwaja, behold this ford which is without dirt, with clear waters and pleasant like a virtuous man's mind. 
"My dear! Let the hand-vessel  be kept . Let my bark-garment be given to me. I will enter this best 
ford of Tamasa only... 
Thus being said by the great-souled Valmiki, Bharadwaaja who was obedient to his Guru, gave the bark-garment to the sage 
That self-controlled Sage Valmiki on taking bark-garment from his disciple's hands, and looking in all directions, indeed moved away from that
wide expanse of forest. 
There holy sage Valmiki saw a couple of curlews, in the vicinity of that river's 
foreshore, flying there about in togetherness and cooing charmingly. 
A tribal hunter with evil intent, and a receptacle of enimity, killed the male 
one among the couple of birds, while Valmiki was looking on. 
The wife was moving together with husband with a red crest and with joy, with good wings, always being united with that male bird. On seeing
that bird slain on ground reeling with blood covered wings really made wailing sounds with piteous utterances on being separated from her 
husband. 

On seeing that bird felled that way by the tribal hunter, compassion occassioned in that 
saintly sage Valmiki. 
Then on seeing the wailing female krounchi bird, out of state of compassion and apperceiving 
the killing of male bird as unjust, the sage uttered this sentence... 
"Oh! violent Hunter, by which reason you have killed one bird of the couple, when it 
was infatuated by passion, for that reason you will never get a state of rest for everlasting years to come..." 

Thus speaking and pondering in his heart, he became thoughtful: "What is this utterance by me in grief and anguish for this bird?". 
That great wise one who was an intellectual and the best among sages, on cogitating, made up his mind and also spoke these words to the 
disciple... 
"While I was tormented by grief, there arose a sentence consisting of four verses possessing metrically posited letters
suitable to be played as song and string music and that will be called Shloka, not otherwise..." 
Even the disciple happily received what that is articulated by the saint, a unique articulation, 
by which the saint too, was delighted. 
Then that saint on performing his bathing in that ford according to custom, and still thinking 
on the purport of his utterance, he returned towards his hermitage. 
Then Bharadwaja, the obedient disciple and an erudite scholar, for he heard and learnt many 
scriptures by listening, on taking handy-vessel full with water followed at the behind of 
his mentor. 
He that knower of dharma, Valmiki, having entered the threshold of hermitage along with disciples, 
and having seated spoke about the day-to-day teachings and also other things, but he himself 
is preoccupied in cogitation on the verse. 
Then, the great resplendent Four-faced creator of fourteen worlds, almighty Brahma, arrived 
there on his own, to see that eminent saint Valmiki. 
Then that pious saint Valmiki is highly surprised on seeing Brahma, and on quickly getting 
up from his seat with his palms adjoined humbly, he stood aside, as he is spellbind. 
Valmiki uninterruptedly venerated Brahma, on inquiring into his well-being, washed his feet, drenched his 
thirst, seated him to rest, and adored at best with customarily obeisance. 
Then god Brahma, who is seated on a high seat, very highly worshipped by Valmiki, also beckoned 
at Valmiki to take a seat. 
Even though Valmiki sat on his seat when duly permitted by Brahma, and though the Grandparent 
of the worlds is manifestly sitting before him, but the same broodings on those happenings 
occurred on that day have recurred on his mind. 
"He that tribal hunter, who killed a cutely calling krouncha bird for no good reason than intending 
to capture the kill, is an evil souled one that caused hardship..." 
Remaining in melancholic mood Valmiki turned his mind to the depth of thinking, and again 
thinking only on the krouncha bird he sung the same verse, involuntarily. 
Then, Brahma smilingly spoke to that eminent saint Valmiki, "But, what that is composed is 
a verse only... and there is no need to think through... 
"Oh, Brahman, that speech of yours sprang forth at my wish alone, hence oh, eminent sage, 
you shall render the legend of Rama, in its entirety... 
"You shall narrate the legend of Rama, the virtuous, intellectual and an intrepid one, and 
a godlike person in this world as well, as you have heard it from sage Narada. 
"The adventures of valorous Rama along with Lakshmana, and the misadventures of demons, known 
or unknown in every detail, and even the plight of Vaidehi which is either revealed or un-revealed 
so far, and whatever legend that has happened, all that will also be known to you, even if 
it were to be unknown, as yet... 
"You shall versify the heart pleasing and merit-yielding legend of Rama, and not a single 
word of yours will not be false in this epic... 
"As long as the mountains and even rivers flourish on the surface of the earth, so long the 
legend of Ramayana will flourish in this world... 
"And as long as Rama's legend authored by you flourishes...till then you will flourish in 
heavenly, in netherworlds, and even in my abode, namely Abode of Brahma... 
On saying thus that Divinity Brahma vanished then and there only, and then that godly sage 
Valmiki came by astonishment, along with his disciples. 
Then all of the disciples of Valmiki sang this verse time and again very delightedly, and 
much astonished they also recited this verse, reciprocally. 
Equally lettered, four-footed is that verse when great Sage Valmiki articulated it, and when 
repetitively recited by one and all, it attained prominence as verse proper. 
Born is an intuition in that great sage and contemplated soul asserting that "I will compose 
entire Ramayana, the epic, in suchlike verses...' 
That celebrated sage and magnanimous seer Valmiki then authored the highly renowned Rama's 
legend extolling Rama's renown, with symmetrically worded verses, and words versified to yield 
meanings semantically, prosody free-flowing, and with hundreds of such verses. 
That epic contains uncomplicated compounds, conjunctions and conjugations, and has expressive 
sentences that are well knit and led evenly and sweetly, and that legend pertains to the best one 
from Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, which also includes the extermination of the Ten headed evil 
named Ravana, and further, it is said by the sage, hence this may now be listened…  When those monkey commanders are relaxed after refreshments, then that sainted lady, who concentrates single-mindedly 
and who is a pursuer of probity, spoke this word to all of them. [4-52-1]
"Oh, vanara-s, if your enervation is eased off by devouring fruits, and if I may listen to that episode of yours, 
I wish to listen to it." Thus Swayamprabha addressed the monkeys. [4-52-2]
Hanuma, the son of Air-god, sincerely started to narrate their episode in its pithiness upon hearing her words. 
[4-52-3]
"The king of all the world and one similar to Mahendra and Rain-god, such an illustrious Rama of Dasharatha entered 
Dandaka forest with his bother Lakshmana, even along with his wife Vaidehi, but Ravana coercively abducted his 
wife from Janasthaana. [4-52-4, 5]
"A valiant one and the king of important vanara-s known as Sugreeva is a vanara and the friend of that kingly 
Rama, and that vanara king expedited us. [4-52-6]
"He mobilised us along with these important vanara-s and Angada as helmsmen to this southerly prospect, which 
is the walkabout of Sage Agastya and watched over by Yama, the Death-god, saying, 'you all shall collectively 
search for Seetha of Videha kingdom together with the demon Ravana, a guise-changer by his wish.' [4-52-7, 8]
"On searching out the southerly direction in its entirety we are all hungered and we all gathered around at a 
tree-stem. [4-52-9]
"All of us were whey-faced, all of us were preoccupied with propositions, thus deluged in the depthless deep of 
our despair we could not overreach the other shore of our oceanic despair. [4-52-10]
"Then straggling our eyes we perceived this wide cavity wrapped up with vines and woods and enwrapped in darkling. 
[4-52-11]
"Swans, water hawks, saarasa-waterfowls were coming out of this cavity drenched in water and sprinkling drops 
of water with the flaps of their wings. [4-52-12]
"I said to all of them, 'Good! Let us enter it,' while they too had some inference about the availability of water 
in here. [4-52-13]
"As our task was hastening us then we all readied ourselves to fall in the cavity by tightly clasping each other's 
hand, and then we fell in this cavity. [4-52-14]
"Thus we readily entered this Black Cavity, and this much is our activity in here as we all have come here by 
our escapade for water, and we neared you when we were ravenous and retrogressing. [4-52-15, 16a]
"And we who are overly harassed by hunger have devoured the fruits and tubers you have offered with the grace 
of your hospitality. [4-52-16]
"You have rescued all of us who were on the verge of hunger-deaths, and what is to be done by vanara-s for you 
in requital that you may please tell." Thus Hanuma spoke to that sainted lady. [4-52-17b, 18a]
When she is spoken thus by those vanara-s then that omniscient Swayamprabha replied this to all of the vanara 
commanders. [4-52-18b, 19a]
"I am very happy with all of the mighty vanara-s and what I have done to you is a part of my conduct in equity, 
hence nothing need be done now in my favour, in the least. [4-52-9b, 20a]
When Hanuma is said that blessed word by that sainted lady in that way, that which is agreeable to propriety, 
then Hanuma said this sentence to her who is with an unreprovable discernment. [4-52-20b, 21a]
"We are now under the auspices of your ladyship comporting yourself in scrupulosity. We lapsed the time stipulated 
for us by the noble-souled Sugreeva by our roving around in this cavity. [4-52-21b, 22]
"Such as you are, a righteous lady, it will be apt of you to cross us over this cavity, as we have overextended 
the timeframe fixed by Sugreeva, whereby our longevity itself is threatened. [4-52-23]
"Oh, prudent lady, sail all of us through. We are rendered as hesitaters with the fear of Sugreeva. We still 
have to achieve an admirable achievement and that deed is also left undone as we are held up in here." Thus Hanuma 
spoke to her. [4-52-24, 25a]
When Hanuma said thus that sainted lady said sentence, "I believe outgoing is impracticable for the incomers in 
aliveness from this cavity. [4-52-25b, 26a]
"By the sublime efficacy of ascesis acquired through my practices of numerous self-restraints I wish to sail all 
of the vanara-s through the incarceration, called this cavity. [4-52-26b, 27a]
"All of you best vanara-s shall close up your eyelids, for it is indeed impossible to attempt an exit with unclosed 
eyes." Thus that sainted lady said to the monkeys. [4-52-27b, 28a]
Then all of those desires of departure are gladdened and immediately shut their eyelids, and further, they lidded 
them with their delicately fingered hands. [4-52-28b, 29a]
She then sailed those noble souled vanara-s who covered their faces with their hands through that cavity barely 
within a minute. [4-52-29b. 30a]
That virtuous and sainted lady on comforting all of the monkeys, who were taken out of that precarious cavity, 
spoke this to them at the exterior of the cavity. [4-52-30b, 31a]
"This one which is surrounded by diverse trees and vines is the magnificent Vindhya Mountain, this mountain is 
Prasravana, and this vast expanse of water is the southerly ocean. Now I wish to return to my mansion... oh, best 
vanara-s, let safety betide you." thus Swayamprabha the Sainted Lady, re-entered the ostentatious cavity, 
called Riksha Bila. [4-52-31b, 32]Having spoken thus to Rama, Vasishta the royal priest added the following righteous words:
"O, Kakutstha, O offspring the Raghu dynasty! From birth, the three spiritual
instructors of a man are his teacher, his father and his mother."
"O, excellent among men! The father of man his life. The teacher instructs him in
wisdom and therefore instructs the teacher is said to be the superior!"
"O, Rama the tormentator of the enemies! I am the spiritual Preceptor to your father and to you too. In obeying my words, you will not transgress the path of the virtuous."
"O, dear prince! These subjects, the traders, the other categories of people and
Brahmana are your people only. In fulfilling your duty to them, you will not be transgressing your righteous path."
"You ought not to be lacking in reverence to your mother who is aged and possessing a noble conduct. By carrying out her words, you will not deviate from the path of the virtuous."
"O, Rama excelling in truth and virtue. By fulfilling the words of the beseeching
Bharata, you will not be false to yourself."
Having heard the sweet words spoken by his spiritual preceptro himself, Rama the
excellent among men replied (as follows) to Vasishta who was seated there.
"The good, which a father and mother do, by giving whatever they can, to their son constantly, by putting him to sleep, rubbing his body with oil etc, nay, by speaking kindly to him every moment, and even by nourishing him, can never be wholly requited."
"The command laid upon me by king Dasaratha, my father, who begot me, cannot
therefore be disregarded."
Hearing Rama's words, the most generous Bharata felt very mcuh anguished and
addressed the following words to Sumantra the charioteer who was standing nearby:
"O, charioteer! Spread speedily the Kusha grass on the ground here for me. I shall remain facing my illustrious brother till he gets propitiated (and grant my request)."
"I shall remain lying down in front of Rama's hut without food or drink and
depriving myself of light until he returns to Ayodhya, like a brahman who is a destitute (lies down at the door of his crditor)."
Seeing Sumantra who was gazing at Rama waiting for his command, the low-spirited
Bharata, on his own, brought a heap of Kusha grass and spread it on the floor.
Rama of great splendour and the best among royal sages spoke to Bharata as follows:
"O Bharata my dear brother! What wrong have I done that you lie down before me?"
"A brahmana may lie down on one side in order to obstruct a willful debtor in this world. But, it is not befitting for a warrior-class.
"O Bharata, Tiger among men! Giving up this formidable resolve, rise up proceed
speedily to Ayodhya the best of cities, from here."
Still sitting in the same posture, Bharata looked at the citizens and rural folk
around on all sides and asked them why they were not entreating his venerable brother to return.
Those people, the inhabitants of town and country replied to the magnanimous Bharata as follows: "We know Rama very well. He is speaking rightly."
"This Rama of exalted merit is indeed standing on his father's words. Hence, we are not able to convince him to return to Ayodhya."
Hearing their words, Rama said to Bharata: "Reflect on the words of your companions, who see rightly."
"O the mighty armed Bharata! Having listened to their testimony and mine, reflect on the matter carefull. Rise and touch me and drink water."
Thereafter, Bharata rose, touched water and spoke as follows: "Let the audience,
including ministers and the guild of traders hear me also."
"I never asked my father for the kingdom, nor did I counsel my mother to enthrone
me. I never gave my approval for the exile of Rama, the venerable hero, who knows his duty very well."
"If it is absolutely essential that one of us should remain here and the command of our father be executed, then it is I who will reside in the forest for fourteen years."
The high-souled Rama was surprised by the sincere words of his brother and by
looking at the inhabitants of town and country, spoke (as follows):
"The disposal, the pledge and the come-by which he was alive, cannot be broken
either by me or by Bharata."
"I cannot accede to the substitute in respect of the sojourn in the forest and it is distasteful thing. What was advised by Kaikeyi was proper and what was done by my father was a righteous deed."
"I am aware that Bharata has necessary patience and due devotion for the elders. All will be propitious in the case of this magnanimous Bharata, who is true to his promise."
"After returning from the forest, I shall rule the earth, assisted by my virtuous
brother."
"The king Dasaratha was indeed solicited for a boon by Kaikeyi. That word of the
king has been fulfilled by me. Hence, relieve our father, the emperor from the blame."When Vashishta spoke in this way, the great-mighty Vishvamitra brandishing Fiery-missile 
challenged Vashishta saying, "withstand this, withstand this..." Thus, sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. 
That reverential sage Vashishta then upraising his Brahma-baton, which is like 
the other baton of the Terminator, spoke this sentence furiously. 
I am staying here only, you meritless Kshatriya, you may clearly display whatever 
prowess you have, oh, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra, I will now ruin whatever vanity 
you or your missiles have. 
"Where stands the force of belligerence when compared to the supreme force of 
sagacity, you abased Kshatriya, watch out for my strength of seraphic sagacity." 
So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. 
With his baton of Brahma Vashishta silenced that matchless and deadly Fiery-missile 
of Gaadhi's son, namely Vishvamitra, as a deluge of water silencing a rage of fire. 

Vishvamitra, the son of Gaadhi then rancorously fusilladed the missiles regulated 
by gods like Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Paashupata, and even a missile which is projectile 
through grass blade called Ishiika. 
Vishvamitra also launched missiles named Humane, Rager, Stupefier, Hypnotiser, 
Yawner, Intoxicator, also thus Humidifier, Weep-inducer. 
He also launched the missiles called Drainer and Ripper, and the highly unconquerable 
Thunderbolt, even the lassos of Brahma, Time and Rain-gods. 
Also missiles called Shiva, Monster, Punisher, Wrester and like that the Baffler, 
Bolter, Drier, Drencher are launched. 
And he launched discs called the Discs of Virtue, Time and Vishnu and he also launched 
other missiles like the Blower, Stirrer and like that the missile with Horse-head. 

A pair of powers are launched, namely Power of Vishnu and the Power of Rudra, like 
that the Impeller, Crowbar, and a great missile called Staggerer, and then he launched 
the lethal missile of the Time. 
Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, Vishvamitra on triggering off all these missiles 
then he launched the deadly Trident, Skull and Torque missiles on Vashishta, and 
whole thing has became a spectacular display of Vishvamitra's arsenal. 
Brahma's son Vashishta defused all of those missiles just with his baton and when 
all of them are thus silenced, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra touched off Brahma's missile. 

When Vishvamitra brandished and set up Brahma missile for launching, seeing it 
all the gods keeping the Fire-god at their vanguard, godly sages, reptiles along 
with gandharva-s are perplexed, and the triad of worlds itself is perturbed. 
Even that deleteriously destructive Brahma's missile is completely consumed with 
the seraphic resplendence of Brahma-baton of Sage Vashishta. 
The appearance of that great-souled Vashishta became appallingly perplexing when 
he is finishing off that Brahma missile as if to surely petrify the Tri-world. 
From all of the pits of hair of that great-souled Vashishta ramified are the raditional 
beams and those radiated shafts are rolling up with the fumes of radiation, so to 
speak. 
The baton of Brahma gripped in his hand and upraised by Vashishta is highly glowing 
as if it is the fumeless inferno of Time, and as if it is the earthly baton of Yama, 
the Terminator. 
'The assemblages of saints then extolled the best meditator Vashishta saying, 'oh, 
Brahman, infallible is your prowess, but bear this combustion of missile by your 
own combustive power. Though Vishvamitra is a supreme ascetic he is forestalled 
by you and your seraphic power, but this power of yours is equally anguishing all 
the worlds. Hence, let the worlds survive shooing away their anguish caused by your 
prowess. Oh, Brahman, be gracious, for you are the best among the best meditators...' 
So said saints to Vashishta. 
When that great-resplendent Vashishta is spoken thus by saints and gods he composed 
himself, and then that estranged Vishvamitra spoke this to himself with heavy suspiration. 

Fie upon the might of Kshatriya, mightier is the might of Brahman's resplendence, 
only with one baton of Brahma all of my missiles are defused. 
" 'Therefore on analysing this matter, I with my heart and senses quietened will 
embark on a sublime ascesis which really will be the causative factor for according 
Brahma-Sage-hood.' So thought Vishvamitra..." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration of Vishvamitra's legend. Eager to see Rama again, Vasishta approached that place, preceded by Dasaratha's
wives.
The king's wives, while moving slowly towards River Mandakini, saw the ford there,vbeing frequented by Rama and Lakshmana.
With a gloomy and emaciated face, filled with tears, Kausalya spoke to Sumitra andvother royal women (as follows):
"This is the ford, located in the eastern region of the forest, frequented by
Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana, banished from the kingdom; those unfortunate persons of illustrious exploits who have no country."
"O, Sumitra! Lakshmana, your son always draws water himself from here unwearyingly for the sake of my son."
"Through engaged in an inferior act (of carrying water), your son is not to be
censured because all that service rendered to his brother is enjoined with virtues."
"Your son too, who is not accustomed to such pains, will indeed be relived now of
this mean, wretched and laborious task."
The large-eyed Kausalya observed a ball made of Ingudi pulp, which was placed by
Rama in honour of his father on the ground, on aheap of Darbha grass, the raised spikes of which pointed towards the south.
Seeing that ball of food placed on the ground by the unfortunate Rama for his
father, the Queen Kausalya spoke to all those wives of Dasaratha (as follows):
"See this ball of food offered traditionally by Rama in honour of his father, the
high-souled Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku race."
"I do not consider this offering as befitting for that great-souled king, who was
like unto a God and who lived amidst every pleasure."
"How can that Lord of the earth, Dasartha, equal to the Lord of celestials and a
mighty man, having enjoyed the earth with its four quarters, the boundaries of which are the oceans, eat a cake of Ingudi pulp?"
"I do not consider any thing painful to me on earth than when Rama the man of
fortune offering a cake of Ingudi pulp to his father."
"Seeing this offering, a cake of Ingudi pulp, of Rama to his father, why does my
heart not break into a thousand pieces with anguish?"
"It indeed occurs to me that the saying among men that the food eaten by man is also consumed by his Gods is true."
Consoling Kausalya thus afflicted by grief, Kausalya's companions then proceeded
further and saw Rama in his hermitage, who resembled an Immortal driven out of Paradise.
Beholding Rama bereft of all enjoyments, his mothers agonized as they were with
grief, emitted cries and allowed tears to flow.
Rama, the tiger among men, true to his promise raised up and took hold of the
auspicious feet of all his mothers.
Those large-eyed Queens, by means of their pleasantly touching soft fingers and
palms as well as charming hands, wiped the dust from Rama's back.
Seeing all those mothers, the wailing Lakshmana too slowly paid obeisance devotedly to them all by bowing to each in turn, immediately after Rama.
All Dasaratha's wives manifested the same affection towards Lakshmana, who was born of Dasaratha and exceedingly handsome, as they did to Rama.
Then, the grief-stricken Seetha, her eyes filed with tears, also touched the feet of her mothers-in-laws and stood before them.
Kausalya embraced the miserable Seetha as a mother her daughter, she who was
emaciated because of her stay in the forest and afflicted with grief, and spoke the following words:
"How has the daughter of King Janaka, the daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha and
Rama's wife, fallen into such a wretched plight that she is living in a desolate forest?"
"O, Seetha! Seeing your face, like a lotus withered with heart or a faded lily or
gold defiled with dust or a moon hidden by the clouds, the fire of grief produced by the firewood of adversity and existing in my mind burns me severely."
While the sorrowful mother was speaking thus, Rama the elder brother of Bharata
approached Vasishta and took hold of his feet in salutation.
Then, Rama holding the feet of that priest, who was equal of Agni the fire and
endowed with very great splendour, even as Indra the Lord of celestials would clasp the feet of Brihaspati, sat down by his side.
Then, after Rama and Vasishta sat, Bharata the pious man along with his counsellors, the leading citizens, warriors and virtuous people seated himself at a lowel level at a proximity to Rama.
Seeing Rama in the garb of an ascetic, radiant in majesty, the extremely powerful
Bharata, paying obeisance to him with joined palms, then took his place in his presence, as the devoted Indra the Lord of celestials sits before Brahma the Lord of creation.
A highest curiosity arose in the minds of those worthy men (assembled there) as to what persuasive words Bharata at that moment would utter, while addressing Rama, having offered salutation and homage to him.
That Rama endowed with truth and forbearance with Lakshmana who was bestowed with
magnanimity and the pious Bharata, surrounded by his companions, were as resplendent as the three sacrificial Fires (known by the names of Garhapatya, Ahavamiya and Dakshina), accompanied by the superintending priests.Recognising that Rama has become angry, Vashishta spoke as follows: "Even Jabali is aware of the going and coming of this world."
"He apoke in this manner, on account of his desire that you should return. O, Lord of the poeple! Learn from me of the creation of the world!"
"All was water only in the beginning" from which element the earth was formed. After that, the self-existent Brahma with all the gods came into existence."
"Thereafter, that Brahma, assuming the form of boar, caused the earth to rise from water and with his sons of pure soul, created the entire world."
"The eternal, changeless and imperishable Brahma was begotten from ether and from
his was born Marichi. Marichi's son was kashyapa."
"From Kashyapa, Vivasvan(sun-god) was born. manu was the son of Vivasvan. Manu for his part, was formerly the lord of creation. Ikshvaku was Manu' s son."
"The entire fertile earth was given by Manu to Ikshvaku and know that Ikshvaku was thus the first king of Ayodhya!"
"Ikshvaku's son was known as Kukshi, the illustrious king. Then, Kukshi's son was
the valiant Vikukshi."
"To Vikukshi was born the most splendid and powerful son, Bana. To Bana was born
Anaranya the mighty armed and the most illustrious son."
"While this King Anaranya, the most excellent among beings was reigning, there was neither dearth of rain nor a drought. No one was a thief."
"From Anaranya was born the mighty armed king Prithu. From Prithu was born the
Emperor Trishanku. That valiant man ascneded to heaven along with his mortal body, because of his true eloquence."
"To Trishanku was born a son, the highly illustrious Dundhumara. From Dundhumara was born the hero, Yuvanasva."
"The illustrious Mandhata was born as a son to Yuvanasva. To Mandhata was born the hero, Susandhi. There were two sons Dhruvasandhi and prasenajit to Susandhi. From Dhruvasandhi was born the illustrious Bharata, the annihilator of enemies."
"From the mighty armed Bharata was born a son named Asita, for whom his royal
adversaries, Haihayas, Talajanghas and the valiant Shashibindavas became the enemies."
"Having drawn out his battle-array against all those kings in a combat, the king
Asita was driven away. Asita then became a devoted sage taking asylum in an excellent and charming mountain."
"Asita's two wives became pregnant. It is a hearsay that one of his wives gave
poison to the other co-wife in order to destroy her foetus."
"A sage called Chyavana, belonging to Bhrign race was staying in a Himalayan
mountain. Kalindi (Asita's wife) approached that sage and offered her salutation. That brahmna spoke the following words to her, who wanted to obtain a boon for the birth of a son."
"O, Queen! A high-souled son, who will be world-famous, rightous, of a good conduct, a perpetuator of the race and an annihilator of enemies will be born to you."
"The delighted Queen Kalindi circumambulated that sage, took permission from him to leave and thereafter on reaching home, had delivered a son, having eyes resembling lotus-leaves and having a radiance like that of Brahama the Lord of creation."
"Poison was given earlier by her co-wife with an intention to kill her foetus. Born with that poison itself, he became Sagara (a man with poison)."
"It was king SAgara who excavated the ocen and who, by his sacrifice, on the day of the full moon, by his energy, frightened the people here by the speed of his digging."
"Asamanja was Sagara's son. There was a hearsay that on account of his wicked deeds, Asamanja was banished by his father even during his life time."
"A valiant son called amshuman was born to Asamanja. Dilipa was Amshuman's son.
Bhagiratha was Dilipa's son.
"Of Bhagiratha was born kakutstha, from whom the Kakutsthas take their name. To
Kakutsthas was born a son called Raghu, from whence spring Raghavas."
"From Raghu was born a renowned son named Pravriddha, known in the world under the names Purushadaka, Kalmashapada and Soudasa."
"Kalmashapada's son was renowned as Shankhana, who, even on attaining his father's valour, perished (in a battle) along with his army."
The fortunate Sudarshana was the son of Shankhana. Sudarshana's son was Agnivarna; and of Agnivarna was born Shighraga. Shighraga begot Maru and Maru's son was Prashushruva from Prashushruva was born Ambarisha of that great radiance. To Ambarisha was born a son named Nahusha who was full of valour. Nahusha's son was Nabhaga of outstanding virtue. Aja and Suvrata were the two sons of Nabhaga and it was Aja who begot the virtuous King Dasartha."
"You are the eldest son of that Dasaratha, very well-known as Rama, the heir who can claim over the inheritance. O, King! Hence, take over your kingdom and look after your people there."
"The eldest son only becomes the king in the entire Ikshvaku race. When the eldest son exists, the younger son will not become a king. The eldest son only is anointed to the crown.
"O, the celebrated one! This is the eternal tradition of your race, those born in
Raghu dynasty and ought not to be violated by you. Rule over the earth, this vast kingdom abudant with precious metals, as did your father."Hearing their words, Vasistha replied thus to that group of friends as well as
ministers and to all the Brahmans (assembled there):
"Bharata, who was given kingdom (by Dasaratha) is staying very happily in his
maternal uncle's home, along with Satrughna. Hence messengers in fast running horses are to be sent quickly to bring back those heroic brothers. What are we to think of further in this matter?"
Then all of them uttered words agreeing to send the messengers quickly. Hearing
their words, Vasistha spoke as follows:
"O, Siddhartha! O, Jay anta! O, Vijaya! O, Ashoka! O, Nandana! Please come. I am
telling you all. Hear that which is to be done"
"After starting quickly from here by traveling in rapidly running horses, you reach the city of Rajagriha. After relieving yourself of the grief, you have to tell Bharata these words as my orders:"
"The royal priest and other ministers are asking about your welfare. Come forth, by starting quickly. There is a very urgent work with you."
"After going there, do not tell him that Rama has gone to exile or that his father is dead or about this calamity occurred to the descendents of Raghu dynasty."
"Go quickly, taking silk clothes and excellent ornaments to the king and to Bharata "
The messengers, who are going to leave for the land of Kekayas, took sufficient
eatables required on their way and went to their respective houses, by riding on their admirable horses.
Having completed all the remaining preparations for the journey and having been
permitted by Vasistha, the messengers quickly proceeded (to the destination).
Those messengers went on touching Malini River, flowing between the passing
Aparatala Mountain and the northern end of Pralamba Mountain.
Having crossed Ganga River at Hastinapura, they proceeded towards west and, reaching Panchala kingdom through Kuru Jangala and observing well filled lakes and rivers with clear water, the aforesaid messengers went briskly, due to the pressing nature of their mission.
They speedily moved on, crossing the beautiful Saradanda River, containing clear
water frequented by various kinds of birds.
Reaching a holy coastal tree called Satyopayaachana (so called because prayers made to it become fulfilled); which was worthy of salutation and going round it clockwise (as a mark of respect) the messengers entered the city of Kulinga
From there having reached a village named Abhikala, they crossed the holy Ikshumati River, which was flowing down from Bodhibhavana Mountain. This region was associated with the father and grandfather of Dasaratha.
Seeing Brahmans skilled in Vedas who survived by only drinking water through hollows of their palms, they proceeded through Bahlika kingdom towards a mountain called Sudama.
Perceiving a locality called Vishnu padam, Vipasa river, Salmali trees, rivers,
ponds, tanks, pools and lakes, as well as seeing many kinds of lions, tigers, antelopes and elephants, they proceeded by that broad lofty high way desirous as they were to execute the command of their master.
Those messengers, though riding on tired horses on a long route, reached quickly and safely to the excellent city of Girivraja.
For the sake of fulfilling the beloved object of their master (Vasistha), for the
sake of preserving the royal family and for keeping up the prestige of the sovereign race, those messengers quickly and respectfully reached that city in the night.Vibhishana, who always arrived at a settlement in matters of virtue, pleasure and
wealth and who was terrible in his act, on arrival of the dawn, entered the palace of Ravana.
Ravana's palace was looking like a mass of rocks, elevated like a mountain-peak,
well-divided into spacious apartments and occupied by eminent men.
It was inhabited by prime ministers, who were intelligent and beloved. It was
guarded on all sides by demons, who were trust worthy and efficient.
The air was filled with the sighing breaths of elephants in rut, with tumultuous
noise produced by the blowing of conches and made to resound by an ensemble of musical
instruments.
The palace was filled with a number of women-folk. It was having principal passages
in which spoken words were heard. It was having turrets made of pure gold and adorned with
excellent decors.
The palace was like an abode of Gandharvas (celestial musicians) and of Maruts
(strom-gods) filled with a collection of jewels resembling a house of Nagas (serpent-gods).
The valiant Vibhishana with great splendour entered that mansion of his elder
brother, Ravana, like the sun with rays outstretched with splendour entering a big cloud.
Vibhishana with great radiance, heard the auspicious sounds of felicitous recital of
prayers uttered by the knowers of Vedas (scriptural texts), wishing for the victory of his
brother.
Vibhishana of great strength, saw Brahmins who know Mantras (sacred texts) and
Brahmanas, respected and offered with pots filled of curd, clarified butter as well as with flowers
and unbroken rice.
The mighty armed Vibhishana, being adored by the deomons and shining by his own
splendour, offered salutation to Ravana the younger brother of Kubera (the lord of riches), who
occupied the throne.
Practicing customary formalities, Vibhishana who knew the code of conduct, obtained
a seat adorned with gold, as endowed to him by a glance of the king.
In the presence of ministers and in privation, Vibhishana spoke to powerful Ravana
the words convinced of reason and which were very much beneficial.
Vibhishana, who could discriminate between good and evil things in the world, having
sought the favour from his eldest (half-) brother by means of soothing words arranged in an order,
spoke in consonance with place, time and purpose.
"O, annihilator of enemies! We are seeing inauspicious omens, since Seetha arrived
here."
"Even if the sacrificial fire is fed with oblations while uttering a proper set of
Mantras (Spiritual texts), the fire is not flaring up well, emitting sparks, its flames are
enveloped in smoke and are coming forth, polluted with soot."
"Serpents are seen at the corner of the sacrificial post which is nearest the fire,
also in houses keeping sacrificial fire and in places where sacred studies are made. Ants are seen
in things to be offered as oblations."
"Cow's milk is getting curdled. Excellent elephants are bereft of rut. Horses are
neighing miserably and are not rejoiced in eating grass."
"O, king! Donkeys, camels and mules shed tears, losing their hair and even if
treated asper medical procedures are not getting cured."
"Crows in flocks are crying cruelly from all sides and are seen in crowds assembled
together on house-tops."
"Vultures fly to and fro in circles over the city. Jackals are crying inauspiciously
at the approach of both dawn and the dusk."
"At city-gates are heard loud cries of carnivorous animals gathered in groups, with
thundering noise."
"O, brave man! Hence, when the actions of evil forces are happening in this way,
this atonement is appropriate that Seetha be given away to Rama and I like it."
"O, emperor! If I am speaking this because of infatuation or greed, in that case
also, you ought not to find fault with me."
"These bad omens are being seen indeed by demons and lady-demons of the city and of
the gynaeceum as well as all these people here."
"All your ministers have abstained to pass this counsel to you. Whatever is seen or
heard, it is to be told certainly by me. Hence, you ought to do according to a justification of
things for the occasion."
Vibhishana, the half- bother spoke these beneficial words to Ravana, the best among
demons in the midst of his half-brother's ministers.
Ravana, who had evil inclination, heard those words, which were beneficial very
well-meant, soft, conformable to reason and suitable for the past future and present times, got
enraged and uttered this reply.
"I do not see any fear from whom so ever. Rama cannot obtain Seetha by any means.
How Rama even along with Indra and the celestials can stand before me in battle?"
Ravana, who annihilated the army of celestials and who was very powerful with an
impetuous valour, thus spoke and then sent away Vibhishana, who had spoken honestly.Bound by that formidable network of arrows, the two high-souled sons of dasaratha
lay bathed in blood, breathing like serpants. All those foremost of monkeys who were exceedingly
strong, including Sugreeva, plunged in grief, were standing around those two illustrious
warriors.
In the meanwhile, the mighty Rama by virtue of his hardihood and native strength,
awoke from his swwon, despite the shafts that held him captive.
Then, beholding his brother, bleeding unconscious, firmly thrown on teh floor, and
his features changed, Rama full of grief lamented thus:
"Of what use to me is the recovery of Seetha or even life itself, since my brother
now lying, before my eyes, has been struck down in teh fight?"
"It can be possible, if I were to look for her, to find a consort equal to Seetha in
this world of mortals but not a brother, a friend and a comrade in a hostile war, such as
Lakshmana!"
"If Lakshmana returned to the five elements, he the increaser of Sumitra's joy, I
will yield up my life-breaths while the monkeys stand looking on."
"What shall I say to my mother, Kausalya or to Kaikeyi? How can I talk to my mother
Sumitra, sighing for the sight of her son?"
"How shall I console Sumitra, trembling and crying out like an osprey, bereft of her
son, if I return to Ayodhya without lakshmana?"
"How shall I tell Shatrughna and the illustrious Bharata when I return without
Lakshmana, who followed to the forest along with me?"
"Alas! I should not be able to endure Sumitra's reproaches. I will leave my body
here itself. I do not wish to continue living."
"Woe unto me to my wicked deed and to my lack of nobility. Through my fault,
Lakshmana has fallen and lies indeed on a bed of arrows as on who has yielded up his life!"
"O, Lakshmana! You always used to consoe me whenever I was in a great sorrow. You,
having lost your life now are not able to allay my sufferings with your words."
"You, who in this battle today, struck down inummerable demons to the earth, are
fallen, pierced by darts, like a hero on the self same field."
"Lying on this bed of arrows, bathed in blood, you are piled up; sharajaalaiH= in a
heap of arrows; saH= you, as such; bhaasi= look; bhaaskaraH= iva= like the sun; vrajan= setting
behind; astam= the horizon.
"Your vital parts having been pierced with arrows, you are not able even to speak
now. Eventhough you not speaking, your agony is disclosed by the redness of your eyes."
"I shall follow him to the region of Yama, as that illustrious warrior accompanied
me when I retired to the forest."
"He who loved his own kinsfolk and was filled iwth devotion for me, got this state
to which my misdeeds have brought him, wretched that I am!"
"I do not remember to have heard any harsh or hateful words from that valiant
Lakshmana, even if he is deeply provoked."
"Lakshmana, who was able to loose five hundred arrows in one shot, was surpassing
kartavirya himself in the science of archery."
"This Lakshmana, who was accustomed to a rich couch and who by his arrows severe the
weapons the mighty Indra the Lord of celestials, is lying slain on the ground."
"Those vain words uttered by me, will ndoubtedly consume me since I have not made
Vibhishana the king of demons."
"O, Sugreeva! You ought to return at once from here since knowing that you are
bereft of my support, Ravana will overcome you, O king!"
"O, Sugreeva! Recross the sea with your army, keeping Angada in front and with your
followers, Nila and Nala."
"I am fully satisfied by the great military exploit, done by Jambavan the king of
Bears and the General of the Monkeys, which was impossible to any other in battle."
"A great act was done by Angada, Mainda and Dvivida. A terrible combat was done by
Kesari and Sampati in the battle-field."
"By Gavaya, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Gaja and other monkeys, who are willing to sacrifice
their lives for me, the battle was carried on."
"O, Sugreeva! It is not possible for mortals to avoid their destiny. O, Sugreeva the
tormentat of enemies! Fearing to fail in your duty, you have done all that which a friend and a
comrade could do."
"O. foremost of Monkyes! You have accomplished all this due to your friendship. I
take leave of you all; go where it seems best to you!"
All the tawny eyed monkeys, who heard Rama's lament thus, allowed tears to fall from
their eyes.
Meanwhile, Vibhishana having established order in all the ranks, with mace in his
hand, came quickly to Rama.
Seeing him, who resembled a mass of collyrium, hastening towards them thus, all the
monkeys thinking him to be Indrajit the son of Ravana, fled away.Having offered his salutation to that Rama, who was excellent among all the wielders
of the bow and whose eyes resembled the lotus-petals, that highly intelligent Hanuma spoke to him
as follows:
"You ought to see Seetha that divine lady who is consumed by grief, for whose sake
this course of actions was undertaken and which has (now) borne fruit."
"Hearing the news of your victory, that Seetha, stricken as she was with grief, is
now longing to see you, her eyes filled with tears of joy."
"By her, who has trust in me because of confidence which has trust in me because of
confidence which had been inspired me on a former occasion, I was spoken as follows: 'I desire to
see my husband, who has accomplished his purpose, together with Lakshmana.'"
Hearing Hanuma's words, Rama who was the foremost among the supporters of
righteousness, was a little over whelmed with tears and suddenly became a bit thoughtful.
Drawing a deep and warm breath and casting his looks on the ground, he spoke (as
follows) to Vibhishana, who closely resembled a cloud in hue and who was standing nearby.
"Bring here Seetha, after she has bathed her head, has been anointed with charming
cosmetics and adorned with beautiful jewels. Let there be no delay."
Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana, after entering the gynaecium in haste,
communicated his presence to Seetha, through his own women.
Then, the glorious Vibhishana the king of demons, after seeing the highly fortunate
Seetha, with his palms joined over his head, humbly spoke to her as follows:
"O Seetha! Anointed with charming cosmetics and adorned with beautiful jewels if you
please, mount on the vehicle. Your husband wants to see you."
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, replied as follows: "O king of demons! I wish to
see my husband, even without taking my bath."
Hearing those words of Seetha, Vibhishana replied as follows: "You ought to do the
bidding of Rama, your husband, as he has enjoined you to do."
Hearing those words of Vibhishana, the virtuous Seetha, regarding her husband as a
divinity, endowed as she was with a devotion to her husband, said in reply, "So t be!"
Prevailing upon Seetha to ascend a shining palanquin, covered with an exceedingly
valuable cloth and guarded by numerous demons, after she had bathed her head and cleansed her body,
had put on costly robes and had been adorned with exceedingly valuable jewels, Vibhishana then
brought her to the presence of Rama.
Approaching the great-souled Rama, who was absorbed in thought, even after coming to
know that Seetha had arrived, Vibhishana offered his obeisance and with full of great joy,
announced to him that Seetha had arrived.
Hearing that Seetha had arrived after living long in the abode of a demon, Rama was
filled with joy, indignation and felt miserable too all the three emotions at the same time.
Feeling unhappy on considering with deep thought, the question of Seetha having come
in a palanquin, all the way, Rama then spoke the following words, looking at Vibhishana who was
beside him.
"O the gently king of demons, who is forever intent on my victory! Let Seetha duly
seek my presence quickly."
Hearing those words of that Rama, Vibhishana, who knew what was right, began to
disperse the crowd there quickly.
Demons wearing jackets and turbans, their hands carrying staffs which made a
jingling sound, walked there all round, dispersing those warriors.
Crowds of bears, monkeys and demons, dispersed on all sides, bounced for a distance,
from their nearness to the palanquin.
While those warriors were being driven away, there was a very great sound,
resembling the roar of a sea, lashed by a storm.
Seeing them being dispersed on all sides excited, Rama then stopped that operation
of those who were dispersing them, out of kindness (for those who were being driven away) and
resentment (at the behaviour of the demons who were dispersing them).
The enraged Rama, consuming the demons with his looks as it were, Rama spoke the
following reproaching words to the highly intelligent Vibhishana
"Why disregarding me, are these people harassed by you? Stop this exertion. They are
my own people."
"An apartment is not a thing that protects a woman, nor robes, nor compound-walls,
nor concealments nor such royal honours. Her character is her shield."
"A woman becoming visible to public in times of a calamity is not condemned in
difficult situations, nor in battles, nor in self-choosing of a husband by a princess at a public
assembly of suitors, nor in sacrificial ceremonies nor in marriage-functions."
"The younder Seetha is in distress and beset with a great difficulty. There is no
fault in her appearance in public, particularly in my presence."
"That is why, let her come on foot alone, leaving the palanquin there. Let these
monkeys see Seetha in my presence."
Hearing the words of Rama the intelligent Vibhishana, with decency, brought Seetha
to Rama's vicinity.
Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana Sugreeva and Hanuma the monkey then felt very
much perturbed.
From the pitiless facial features of Rama, showing indifference to his consort, they
conjectured as if Rama had some displeasure towards Seetha.
Seetha, for her part, shrinking into her limbs with modesty, approached her husband,
duly followed by Vibhishana.
The pleasant-faced Seetha, who considered her husband as the divinity, saw the
charming face of her husband, with a surprise, rejoice and affection.
Seeing the face of her beloved husband, which had not been seen for a long time and
which was charming like the rising full moon, she forth dispelled her mental fatigue.Seeing Lakshmana and Indrajit, fighting with commitment to gain victory one over the
other, like elephants in rut, that strong and valiant Vibhishana, wielding his excellent bow, stood
there at the battle-front, with an intent to behold their combat.
Standing there thus, Vibhishana stretched his great bow and released excellent sharp
pointed arrow son those demons.
Falling in exact spot, those arrows, hitting like fire, tore the demons into peices,
as thunderbolts would cleave large mountains.
Even the foremost of demons, the attendants of Vibhishana too, rent asunder those
valiant demns in battle, with pikes, sowrds and sharp-edged spears.
Surrounded by those demons, Vibhishana shone like an elephant in the midst of proud
young tuskers.
Vibhishana, who knew the timing, spoke to the monkeys, who cherished to destroy the
demons, the following opportune words duly inspiring them.
"O cheifs of monkeys! Here stands before you, one who is the last support of Ravana.
He is all that is left in his force. Why do you stand idle?"
"At the end of this war, if this sinful demon is killed, the remaining army is as
good as killed, except Ravana."
Prahasta was killed. The valiant Nikumbha, the mighty Kumbhakarna, Kumbha, the demon
called Dhumraksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, the highly swift Ashaniprabha, Suptaghna, Yajnakopa, a
demon named Vajradamshtra, Samhadri, Vikata the destroyer of enemies, Tapana, Manda, Praghaasa,
Praghasa, PrajaN^gha, JaN^ga, Agniketu who was difficult to be conquered, Agniketu, the valiant
Rashmiketu, vidyujjihva, Dvijihva, Suryashatru, Akampana, Suparshva, Chakramali, Kampana and the
mighty Devantaka were also killed."
Having killed these many mighty and foremost of demons and having swun the ocen, let
the tiny puddle be crossed.
"O monkeys! Only this much of army remains yet to be conquered here. All the demons,
who were proud of their strength, having come to the battle-field here, were killed by you."
"Driving away tenderness, for the sake of Rama, I will kill my own brother's son
though being his uncle (who is as good as a father), it is not appropriate for me to compose his
death."
"My eyes are getting cluded with tear, even when I think of killing him. This
long-armed Lakshmana alone will finish him. O Monkeys! All of you, together, kill his servents
standing beside him."
Thus impelled by that illustrious Vibhishana, those monkey-chiefs were rejoiced and
lashed their tails (in a happy mood).
Then, those monkeys-cheifs, roaring time and again, emitted various kinds of sounds
resembling the sounds of peacocks at the time of seeing the clouds.
Even Jambavan and those monkeys, accompanied by all those, who belong to their
identical troops, began to strike the demons with stones, nails and teeth.
Those mighty demons, having various kinds of weapons, abandoning their fear,
surrounded that Jambavan, who was playing havoc on them.
They struck Jambavan, who was killing the army of demons in battle, with sharp axes,
spears with sharp edges, sticks and javelins.
That tumultuous and terrific battle accompanied by a great noise, occured between
the monkeys and the demons as between enraged celestials and demons.
That haughty Hanuma too who felt enraged, causing Lakshmana to descend from his
back, and tearing up Sala tree from a mountain, approached the demons and himself began to destroy
those demons in their thousands.
That mighty Indrajit, the destroyer valiant enemies, after giving a tumultuous fight
to his uncle, yet again rushed towards Lakshmana.
The two valiant celebreties, Lakshmana and Indrajit, the two intense fighters in
battle, then began to strike each other, showering a multitude of arrows on their enemies.
The mighty and energetic Lakshmana and Indrajit covered each other off exceedingly
by a network of arrows, in the same way as the sun and the moon are veiled by clouds at the end of
summer.
Due to lightness of their hands, even as they fight there, neither the holding of
the bow, nor the taking off the arrows, nor fitting them on their bow-string, nor adjusting their
fists, nor drawing the bow-string nor attaining the target was visible.
The sky, having been covered by a multitude of arrows, on all sides, discharged with
force by them both, was shrouded in darkness.
Meeting Indrajit, Lakshmana fought with him. Meeting Lakshmana, Indrajit too took
the offensive. As they clashed with each other, there was terrible confusion (as to who would win
ultimately).
By the sharp arrows released almost continuously with the sky was covered with
darkness.
By the fall of a multitude of their sharp arrows in hundreds, the quarters and
sub-quarters were filled with arrows.
All the space was covered with darkness, showing up great fear. While the sun was
setting down, encircling darkness all over, large streams of blood in plenty poured out.
Cruel and carnivorous animals diffused awful sounds with their roaring noise. Wind
did not blow at that time nor the wind blazed up.
Those great sages proclaimed, "May it be well for the (three) worlds!" The
frightened Gandharvas the celestial musicians along with Charanas, the wandering singers arrived
there to see tha battle-field.
By discharging four arrows, Lakshmana then struck four black gold-adorned horses of
Indrajit.
Thereupon, with alacrity of his hand, that illustrious Lakshmana, fully stretching
and releasing another sharp thunderbolt-like arrow, named Bhalla, which was yellowish in colour,
with charming plumes, having a good splendour similar to Indra's thunderbolt and echoing a clapping
sound, severed the head of Indrajit's charioteer from his trunk, even as he was circling
around.
When the charioteer was killed, the greatly splendoured Indrajit did the
charioteering by himself and also took hold of his bow.
For them, who saw his capability in that battle, it looked wonderful. When he was
driving his horses, Lakshmana struck him with sharp arrows. When he was attending to his bow, he
released arrows on horses.
Lakshmana, who was swift in his acts, tormented Indrajit who was ranging the
battle-field fearlessly, with a multitude of arrows on such opportune occasions.
Seeing his charioteer killed in battle, Indrajit became dejected and los this
entusiasm in undertaking the combat.
Seeing Indrajit with a despondent face, the monkey-chiefs were very much dejected
and then acclaimed Lakshmana.
Then, four monkey-leaders named Pramathi, Rabhasa, Sharabha and Gandhamadana,
getting impatient, acted hastily.
Those four mokeys, having a great might and terrible prowess, quickly bounced and
descended on his ecellent horses.
Blood started flowing from the mouths of those horses pressed under the weight of
those monkeys, as huge as mountains.
Those crushed orses, with their limbs broken as also moving to and fro, fell down
dead on the ground. After killing his hrses, those monkeys also crushed that great chariot and
jumping up again with speed, they stood by the side of Lakshmana.
That Indrajit; hatasaarathiH= whose charioteer was killed hataashvaat= and whose
horses were destroyed; avaplutya= leaped down; rathaat= from his chariot; abhyadhaavata= and
attacked; saumitrim= Lakshmana; sharavarSheNa= with streams of arrows.
Then, that Lakshmana like Indra the lord of celestials, restrained those arrows with
many a number of his arrows. That Indrajit was coming on foot, as his excellent ohrses had been
killed and began to release exquisite sharp arrows in battle.Seeing Prahasta setting out with a martial ardour, Rama the conqueror of enemies,
smiling, spoke to Vibhishana as follows:
"Who is he with a very huge body, coming with a great speed along with a large army?
O, the mighty armed! Tell me about this strong demon."
Hearing Rama's words, Vibhishana replied as follows "He is guarded by two-thirds of
the army of Lanka. He is a demon of prowess, skilled in the use of mystic weapons and valiant. He
is the demon named Prahasta, the Army general of Ravana."
That huge and powerful army of monkeys, who began to emit cries of defiance with
fury, thereupon saw the terrible Prahasta of formidable exploits coming forth towards them.
Swords, lances, daggers, darts, spears, clubs, maces bars, barbed missiles, various
kinds of axes and different bows glittered in the hands of demons, who were running up towards the
monkeys and seeking victory.
The monkeys who were burning to fight took hold of trees in flower, rocks and lofty
and thick stones.
As they approached each other, a very great battle arose between those combatants
who showered down a hail of arrows and a bombardment of stones.
In that battle, many of the demons killed several excellent monkeys and several
monkeys killed many of the demons.
Some monkeys were smashed by spears and some others by finer weapons. Some were
struck by iron bars and some others were slit by axes.
Yet again, some fell breathlessly on the ground and some were destroyed by the
arrows aimed at them with their hearts splits asunder.
Cut into two with the strokes of swords by those powerful demons, some monkeys,
trembling, fell on the earth, their sides torn open.
Even the flock of demons on all sides were crushed on to the earth by the furious
monkeys with tree and mountain-peaks.
Having been administered thundering slaps with their hands and terrific blows with
their fists, the faces and eyes of demons were were lacerated. The demons vomited plenty of blood
from their months.
A tumultuous clamour arose among monkeys and demons, as cries of pain and leonine
roars were bellowed.
The monkeys and the demons with anger, following the path of heroes, with their
cruel and hostile eyes, accomplished their deeds with great courage.
Narantaka Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata all these companions of Prahasta killed
the monkeys.
Dvivida, with a mountain-peak, struck down Narantaka, the one among them who was
rushing upon quickly and killing the monkeys.
The ape Durmukha on his part, with a ready hand, uprooted a very large tree and
crushed the demon Samunnata.
The energetic Jambavan with a great fury seized a huge rock and threw it on the
chest-region of Mahanada.
Then, the valiant Kumbhahanu there in the battle, having attacked the General Tara,
who was armed with a huge tree, received a blow immediately cost him his life.
Not tolerating the aforesaid act, Prahasta having occupied his chariot with bow in
hand, caused a terrible havoc among the monkeys.
Then, with the rapid movement of both the armies, there arose of clamour resembling
the roar of an unfathomable and tempestuous ocean in a time of dissolution.
The demon Prahasta, who was hard to be subdued in battle, with full of anger,
tormented the monkeys by an immense avalanche of arrows in that great combat.
By the frightening corpses of monkeys and demons, appearing like hideous mountains,
a very extensive area of the ground is covered.
That ground, covered by the stream of blood, shone as in the month of spring when
overspread fully with the bloossoming crimson-coloured Palasa flowers.
With the heaps of warriors for its banks the broken weapons its trees, the torrents
of blood its huge waves, death appeared like an ocean receiving its floods, livers and spleens its
mire, entrails its moss, severed heads and trunks the fish, and morsels of flesh the grass, the
innumerable vultures its lovely swans, herons its geese, covered as it was with fat for the foam,
the tumult the sound of its waters, the battle field resembled a river, incapable of being crossed
by cowards, visited by water-fowls at the end of the rainy season, those demons and the foremost of
the monkeys crossed over that impassable river, as elephants lead their herds across a lake that
the lotuses have covered with pollen.
Then, Nila saw Prahasta who was employing a multitude of arrows sitting in the
chariot and annihilating the monkeys swiftly.
Seeing Nila who was running towards him in the battle-field, as a rocking wind in
the sky rushes towards a large massive clouds, Prahasta the Army general attacked Nila himself with
his chariot having the sun's colour.
That Prahasta the Army General, who was excellent among the wielders of bow, drew
the bow-string and hurled the arrows towards Nila in that great battle.
Those arrows with a great speed resembling furious snakes employed by Prahasta
proceeded towards Nila, pierced him and fell on the ground.
That great ape of prowess Nila, who was struck by sharp arrows resembling flames,
uprooted a tree and thumped it on the descending Prahasta who was most difficult to be
assaulted.
Being unable to restrain the series of arrows hurled at him by that evil-minded
demon, nila received them with closed eyes.
Like a bull standing under a sudden autumnal down-pour, so under that intolerable
and sudden rain of darts released by Prahasta, Nila endured with closed eyes though it was scarce
to be endured.
The exceedingly strong and the great Nila, enraged over the volley of darts, killed
Prahasta's horses by hurling a huge Sala tree on them.
Thereafter the greatly enraged Nila quickly broke the bow of Prahasta the
evil-minded demon and shouted again and again.
Deprived of his bow, Prahasta the leader of the army, seizing a formidable mace,
leapt down from the chariot.
Those two army-chiefs, who were courageous and in whom enmity had sprung up, with
their limbs covered with blood, wee standing like two elephants in rut.
Lion and tiger in gait, lion and tiger in gestures, those two warriors tore each
other with their shap teeth. Vanquishers of other heroes and intrepid combatants, both of them,
thirsting for fame, resembled Vritra and Indra.
Then, that Prahasta exerting himself well struck Nila on his forehead with a mace
and blood oozed from his forehead.
Whereupon, that great ape, his limbs smeared with blood, seized a huge tree and
struck Prahasta full in his chest with fury.
Ignoring that blow, he seized a huge mace and ran in strength towards Nila the
strong monkey.
Seeing Prahasta of terrible velocity briskly rushing towards him, Nila the great
monkey took a huge rock swiftly.
Nila quickly hurled that rock on the head of Prahasta who was longing for war and
fighting with a mace in the battle.
Then, that huge and terrific rock hurled by Nila the leader of the monkeys broke
Prahasa's head into myriad pieces.
That Prahasta who lost his breath, was disfigured and dead, bereft of his senses and
at once fell on the ground like a tree cut up by the root.
A lot of blood oozed from his broken head. From his body two, blood streamed forth
like a cascade from a mountain.
Thier leader having been slain by Nila that unshakable and large army of demons,
becoming disconsolated, withdrew to Lanka.
Thier chief of Army having been killed, those demons could not continue to stand
firmy there, any more than water on reaching a breached bridge.
That Prahasta the chief of Army having been slain, those demons dumb dispirited and
inactive, regained the abode of their king. They became unconscious as it were plunged in an ocean
of burning grief.
The triumphant Nila, however, was honoured by Rama and Lakshmana for his task well
accomplished and experienced supreme joy.Hearing the words of Ravana the king of demons and the growls of Kumbhakarna,
Vibhishana spoke the following friendly and meaningful words to Ravana the foremost king of
ogres:
"By whom, O, king, has been wrapped around your neck, this great serpent of gigantic
body called Sita, with heap of expended hoods as her bosom, having poison as her anxiety and with
sharp fangs as her sweet smile and with five hoods as her five fingers."
"Even before the monkeys with their body size as mountain peaks, having their teeth
and nails as weapons, rush full upon the city of Lanka, give back Sita to Rama."
"Even before arrows resembling thunder bolts and with a speed equal to wind,
dispatched by Rama, take away the heads of chiefs of demons, give back Sita to Rama."
"O, king! Either Kumbhakarna or Indrajit and either Mahaparsva or Mahodara and
either Nikumbha or Kumbha or even Atikaya cannot withstand Rama in battle."
"Even if you are protected by the sun god, or by Maruts (storm gods) nor even seated
in the lap of Indra or god of Death nor if you have penetrated into the regions of heaven or under
the earth you will not be spared by the arrows of Rama."
Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Prahasta spoke as follows: "We are not knowing of
fear at all. We do not have fear of either celestials or demons at any time."
"We do not have fear from Yakshas (demi- gods) or Gandharvas (celestial musicians)
or eminent Nagas (serpent demons) or from birds and reptiles on the field of battle. When such is
the case, how can we have fear from Rama, the son of a human king at any time in battle?"
Vibhishana who desired the welfare of the king and who possessed a stable mind in
virtue wealth and pleasure, after hearing the inimical words of Prahasta, spoke highly meaningful
words as follows:
"O, Prahasta! The series of actions king or Mahodara as also yourself and
Kumbhakarna propose to take against Rama are impossible of being accomplished, any more than going
to heaven by wicked minded persons."
"How is it possible by me or by you or by all the demons to kill Rama, who is expert
in all matters, any more than a person without a bark to cross a great ocean."
"Even the celestials would feel bewildered when placed in front of the king Rama who
gives priority to righteousness, is a great car warrior, was born in the dynasty of Ikshvaku and is
capable of accomplishing his objects."
"O, Prahasta! The sharp arrows discharged by Rama, which are furnished with heron's
feathers and are dangerous to be approached, have not yet penetrated, duly piercing, your body.
That is why, you indulge in a boastful talk."
"The sharp and fatal arrows, discharged by Rama with the speed of a thunderbolt,
have not yet penetrated, duly splitting your body. That is why; you are indulged in a boastful
talk."
"Ravana or Triseersha, with great strength or Nikumbha the son of Kumbhakarna or
Indrajit or yourself are not capable to withstand Rama, who is equal in strength to Indra, in
battle."
"Even Devantaka or Narantaka or Atikaya or Atiratha of gigantic proportions, or
Akampana who is mighty as an ocean are not capable to withstand against Rama in battle."
"This king who is overcome by evil addictions, * is rude in nature and acts
inconsiderately. Such a king is being surrounded as a caucus by you who are his companions taking
the form of his enemies for the ultimate destruction of demons."
"You lift up and release this king, who has been wrapped forcibly by a terrific and
exceedingly strong snake of boundless proportions having thousand hoods and make him completely
free."
"All the well-wishers who are getting their desires fulfilled by the king, should
come together and protect the king by coercion even by pulling his hair if necessary as one who is
taken ossession of by evil spirits with terrific strength, is protected by one's kith and kin."
"This Ravana, for his part who is going to be enveloped forcibly by an ocean in the
shape of Rama - which is full of excellent water (who possesses excellent moral character) and who
is about to fall into the mouth of Patala (the nethermost subterranean region) in the shape of
Rama, is fit to be rescued united by you."
"I am telling these right and wholesome words, as per my opinion, to this city and
the demons inhabiting in it as well as to the king and his well wishers: Let Sita be given back to
Rama."
"A counselor is he, who after knowing the strength of the enemies and that of his
own (master) and even so duly grasping with his intellect, the status quo, fall, or rise in
military power like-wise on both sides, renders advice which is appropriate to the interest of his
king."ter the inviolable Rama who possesses sacred knowledge, after hearing
Hanuman's words, spoke with a clear understanding, the following opinion that was firm in his
mind:
"I also wish to tell my opinion about Vibhishana. I want it to be heard by you, who
are firmly established in our welfare."
"By any means, I do not desert anyone who arrives with a friendly appearance, even
if he has a defect. His acceptance is irreproachable in the eyes of good men"
Then, Sugreeva the chief of monkeys closely analyzed and examined the aforesaid
words of Rama and thereafter spoke the following most auspicious words:
"What matters if this ranger of night is very dangerous or other wise, if he can
desert his own brother at a time of peril? Whom will he not betray subsequently?"
Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Rama who was truly mighty looked round all of them ,
smiled a little and spoke the following words to Lakshmana, of virtuous characteristics:
"Without studying scriptures and without serving elders, it is not possible to speak
such words as Sugreeva spoke."
"It appears to my mind that there is however something peculiar in these
circumstances which are clearly to be seen in all lives of kings and even occurring in ordinary
life."
"It is told that persons of the same family and rulers belonging to adjoining
territories become enemies and strike in times of adversities. For this reason, he came here."
"Even if belonging to the same family, persons who are virtuous do respect their own
well wishers in that family. Generally among kings, even a virtuous person is apprehended."
"With regard to the draw back you told me in the matter of accepting a person coming
from the side of an adversary, hear from me what the scriptures say."
"We do not belong to the same family. Further, Vibhishana the demon is desirous of
acquiring the kingdom. A few of the demons also may be rather learned ones. That is why, Vibhishana
is acceptable."
"Kinsfolk do not live together in a fearless mode and in a delightful manner. Hence,
they get a split among themselves. For this reason, a fear has come to him. This loud appeal is
also major cause. That is why, Vibhishana can be accepted."
"My dear one! Neither all brothers are like Bharata, nor all sons of a father like
me nor all friends are like you."
Hearing Rama's words Sugreeva who was together with the highly wise Lakshmana stood
up saluting and spoke these words:
"O, Rama the excellent among the tolerant! Realise that Ravana has sent Vibhishana,
the demon. I think of him to be worthy of being taken as a captive."
"O, the mighty armed Rama! The faultless one! This demon is being sent to kill you
who are unsuspecting, or to kill Lakshmana or me in trust. He came here with a crooked mind. He
with his counselors is fit to be imprisoned. Is not Vibhishana the brother of cruel Ravana?"
Speaking thus to Rama, the best of Raghu dynasty, Sugreeva who knew the mode of
expression, thereafter kept silent.
Hearing those words of Sugreeva, Rama pondered over the words and thereafter spoke
more auspicious words to Sugreeva as follows:
"What does it matter whether that demon is very bad or not bad? He is incapable of
doing even a little harm to me."
"O, Sugreeva, Lord of monkey-troops! If I wish, I can kill those devilish beings,
demons, supernatural beings and ogres living on earth with just a tip of my finger"
"It is narrated how by a dove, its enemy ( a fowler) when it came for a refuge, was
received according to rules of hospitality and was invited for a feast with its own flesh."
"O, the excellent of monkeys! The aforesaid dove indeed accepted as a guest, the
fowler as he came, although he killed its wife .How much more a man like me has to do?"
"Hear the verses inculcating virtue so long ago, by Kandu, the son of a sage called
Kanva, a great sage and a speaker of truth."
"O, king the terminator of enemies! Even an enemy, who formed a cup with his
hollowed hands, a miserable person, a person who is begging and who is seeking a refuge should not
be killed with the aim of not being cruel."
"An enemy who comes for protection against others, even if the aforesaid enemy is
oppressed or arrogant, is to be protected by one who has a disciplined mind, even by abandoning
one's life."
"If he does not protect rightly through his strength, by fear or by ignorance or by
desire, it is a sin to be reproached by the world."
"If having not been protected, a refugee dies before the eyes of a man who is able
to protect him, the former takes along all his moral merit and goes."
"In not protecting thus the persons who take refuge, there is a great blemish
involved in it. It does not bestow heaven. It destroys reputation. It devastates strength and
valor"
"I will follow the excellent words of Kandu. It becomes a very righteous thing,
gives reputation, leads to heaven and the rewards appear consequently."
"He who seeks refuge in me just once, telling me that  I am yours', I shall give him
assurance of safety against all types of beings. This is my solemn pledge"
"O, Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys! Let him either be Vibhishana or even Ravana
himself; I have given an assurance of safety to him. Bring him here."
Hearing Rama' s words, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, overwhelmed as he was with
cordial friendship, replied to Rama as follows:
"O, Rama, who knows righteousness, the crest jewel among lords of the world! What
surprise is there in thinking that you, duly endowed with true essence of life and established in a
right path, speak these venerable words?"
"My inmost spirit also feels Vibhishana to be a genuine person, he being well
examined from all angles, by act of inference and by his appearance."
"O, Rama! Hence, let the highly wise Vibhishana be equal among us soon together. Let
him get our friendship too"
Hearing those words of Sugreeva, Rama the king of men, as acknowledged by Sugreeva,
held meeting with Vibhishana, as Indra the lord of celestials once met Garuda the king of
birds.

  Having spoken the aforesaid harsh words to Ravana, Vibhishana arrived almost
immediately to the place where Rama was together with Lakshmana.
Those leaders of monkeys standing on the ground saw Vibhishana, resembling the peak
of Mount Meru and shining like a thunderbolt in the sky.
His four companions of terrific prowess were also there with him. They were wearing
weapons and armour and were adorned with excellent ornaments.
Vibhishana also resembled a mass of cloud, the equal of the God who wields the
thunderbolt. He was holding excellent weapons and was adorned with wonderful jewels.
Sugriva the valiant of monkeys, who was difficult to be overpowered, having seen
Vibhishana, the fifth one along with four others, became thoughtful along with monkeys.
Having thought for a moment, Sugriva spoke these sterling words to all those monkeys
and to Hanuman in particular.
"See this demon possessing all types of weapons, coming along with four demons.
There is no doubt that he is coming to kill us."
Hearing Sugriva's words, all those excellent monkeys lifted trees and mountains and
spoke as follows:
"Do you swiftly order us to slay these wicked doers, O, king? Let us strike these
fools down so that they drop to the ground!"
While the monkeys were speaking thus among one another, Vibhishana had reached the
northern shore and indeed coolly halted there.
That great and highly intelligent Vibhishana, halting in the sky itself, saw Sugriva
and those monkeys and spoke to them in a loud voice (as follows):
"There is a demon called Ravana, the king of demons, having a bad conduct. I am his
younger brother, known as Vibhishana."
"It is Ravana who, having killed a bird Jatayu, took away Sita from Janasthana.That
unfortunate lady is held captive against her will and she is now amidst the female titans who guard
her jealously"
"I persuaded Ravana again and again by my diverse words and arguments to restore
Sita smoothly to Rama.
"That Ravana, impelled by fate, did not receive my sage advice, as a perverted
person does not accept his prescribed medicine"
"Reviled by him and humiliated as a slave, I, leaving my sons and my wife, have come
to take refuge with Rama."
"Inform immediately to high soled Rama, the protector of all the worlds, that I,
Vibhishana, have come here."
The swift-paced Sugriva, having heard the words of Vibhishana, spoke more hurriedly
to Rama, in front of Lakshmana as follows:
"Belonging to the enemy force, here is an adversary taking us unawares, who
unexpectedly has come here to slay us at the first opportunity like an owl destroying crows!"
"O, annihilator of enemies! You ought to be aware of the design, distribution,
leading of the army and the secret service of the monkeys and also of your foes. May good come to
you!"
"These demons can assume any form at will and can disappear. They are valiant and
deceitful. We can not trust them at any time."
"He may be a spy of Ravana the king of demons. He will succeed to become a member
among us and create differences. There is no doubt."
"Otherwise he , intelligent by himself, can get into possession of a weak point in
us. Having first gained our confidence by craft, he may even at any time attack us."
"A contingent supplied by friends or an inhabitant of the woods (like our selves),
or furnished by hereditary warriors or paid servants - all these contingents can be accepted but
not that furnished by an enemy."
"O, Lord! He is indeed a demon by nature and a brother of an enemy who came directly
from an adversary. How can we keep trust in him?"
The younger brother of the famous Ravana, called Vibhishana along with four other
demons approached you for refuge."
"O, the excellent one among men knowing what is right! Know that Ravana is sending
Vibhishana. I opine that Vibhishana is fit for arrest."
"O, the faultless one! Being sent with a crooked intent, this demon came here to
attack when you are going to repose faith in him, (remaining hidden by his witchcraft).
"This Vibhishana is indeed the brother of cruel Ravana. Hence, let him along with
his ministers be killed, by imposing severe punishment on them."
The chief of army Sugriva, who knew how to speak expressed thus hurriedly to Rama,
who was skilled in oratory and thereafter entered into silence.
Hearing those words of Sugriva, the exceedingly strong Rama addressed as follows to
the monkeys in front of Hanuman staying near by:
"The very reasonable words uttered by Sugriva about Vibhishana were heard by you
too."
"An efficient and intelligent person ever desirous of everlasting well being of his
friends should properly advise them well in difficult matters. Hence, tell your opinion one by
one"
Thus asked by Rama, those monkeys free from lassitude, wishing to do good and out of
their politeness, spoke their respective opinions to Rama as follows:
"O, Rama! Nothing is unknown to you in the three worlds. You are consulting us with
a friendly heart, as an honor to us."
"You are avowed to truth, a valiant man and a righteous man of firm fortitude. You
take action only after proper investigation. You have good memory. You are committed in your heart
to your friends."
"Hence, your counselors, who are rich in their minds and are moreover efficient, one
by one, will tell their opinion with reason."
Having spoken thus by the monkeys, Angada the intelligent monkey told Rama to
arrange for examination of Vibhishana before hand."
"Vibhishana who came from an enemy is indeed to be doubted by all means. He is not
to be made as a trust worthy person so soon."
"Deceitful persons move around, concealing their peculiar nature and attack at weak
places. They will create a very great misfortune."
"One must take a decision, after ascertaining the pros and cons of it. One should
take up the action, if there is an advantage and reject it, if it is faulty."
"O, king! If there are great faults in him, let him be rejected undoubtedly. If we
recognize many good qualities in him, let him be accepted."
Thereafter Sharabha on his part spoke the following meaningful and decisive words:
"O, tiger among men! Let a spy be sent to shadow him"
"By sending out a spy and causing a suitable investigation by a keenly intellectual
spy, he can then be accepted as per justice."
Then, the discerning Jambavan on his part, perceiving the matter through his
learning derived from scriptures, advised the following fault-less and qualitative words:
"This Vibhishana came from sinful Ravana who has contracted hostility with you and
that too at a wrong place and time. He is to be suspected by all means."
Then Mainda, skilled in discriminating good and bad conduct in others observed the
matter carefully and spoke in his perfect oratory in the following highly reasonable words:
"O, king of kings! This Vibhishana is indeed the younger brother of that Ravana. Let
him be questioned slowly by sweet words"
"O, the best among men! Having read actually his mind whether he is dangerous or
not, you should act according to your feelings."
Then the well educated Hanuman, the excellent among counselors; spoke the following
smooth meaningful, sweet and brief words:
"Even Brihaspati, while talking cannot excel you, who are possessing an exalted
intellect. You are powerful and the foremost man among those who are eloquent."
"O, king! O, Rama! I am talking neither for argument, nor for competition (with
other counselors, nor for superiority, nor out of passion for debate but on account of importance
of this matter in hand."
"I am perceiving an error in what was advised by your counselors assigned to look
into advantages and disadvantages, accruing from accepting Vibhishana. It is not possible for such
a judicious investigation into his character."
"Without entrusting any work, it is not possible to understand his ability. But at
the same time, it occurs to me as a mistake to entrust any work so soon to a stranger."
"What ever was told by your counselors that it was befitting to send spies to
Vibhishana, that action is not possible due to impracticality of the proposition."
"It has been said that Vibhishana came into a wrong place and time. In that matter,
I have to express my thought. Listen to it."
"This place and time become rightly obtained in his mind , as he has thought that
you are superior to Ravana and also found merits in you and demerits in Ravana."
"It is indeed appropriate for him to arrive at this place and time, by seeing the
prowess in you and the wickedness in Ravana. It is worthy of his judgment."
"O, king! Whatever was told by your counselors that let Vibhishana be questioned by
spies of unknown identity, my considered view is as follows:
"A wise man being questioned suddenly would be apprehensive of that questioning. In
those circumstances, an easily obtained friend becomes faithless upon facing a deceitful
questioning."
"O, king! Without possessing a high skill of reading his diversified tones, it is
not possible rapidly to comprehend his intention."
"I am not seeing any bad intention at all in his talk. His face is also bright.
Hence, I do not doubt him."
"A deceitful person does not approach so fearlessly and confidently. His expression
too is not bad. Hence, there is no doubt to me on him."
"It is not possible to hide expression of the face, even if it is concealed. By
force, the internal intent of the persons certainly gets revealed."
"O, the eminently skillful man in work! An action endowed with proper place and time
transacts successfully, if it is performed quickly."
"Seeing your perseverance and the improper conduct of Ravana as well as hearing
about Vali having been killed and Sugriva anointed as king, he deliberately came here, with a
desire to obtain the kingdom of demons. On consideration of this aspect alone, he is worthy of
acceptance by us."
"O, Rama the best among the wise! It has been told by me this according to my
ability about the sincerity of this demon. After hearing my words, you are indeed the final judge
of the issue."While the assurance of protection having been given to Rama, the highly sagacious
Vibhishana the brother of Ravana bent down and glanced towards the earth.
The virtuous Vibhishana descended joyously from the sky to the ground along with his
faithful companions and alighted in the vicinity of Rama.
Thereafter, Vibhishana along with the four demons fell prostrate and spoke to Rama
the following words which were equitable suitable and delightful.
"I am the younger brother of Ravana and was humiliated by him. I sought refuge in
you, who are the refuge for all the beings."
"Abandoning Lanka, friends and possessions, I place my kingdom, life and happiness
at your disposal."
Hearing those words of Vibhishana, Rama in a soothing tone and with a refreshing
look in his eyes, spoke these words: "Tell me really the strengths and weaknesses of the
demons."
Thus asked then by Rama who was unwearied in action, Vibhishana started telling
about the detailed strength of Ravana.
"O, prince! Because of a special boon given by Brahma (lord of creation), Ravana can
not be killed by all beings, Gandharvas (celestial musicians), serpents, and birds."
Kumbhakarna, my elder brother born after Ravana, who is valiant and highly powerful,
has enough strength to fight against Indra (Lord of celestials) in battle.
"O, Rama! You might have heard about Prahasta, his chief of army. He defeated
Manibhadra in a battle on the mountain of Kailasa."
"When furnished with gloves made of the skin of Iguana (to prevent injury from the
bowstring) and when clad in armor that no arrow can pierce, that Indrajit (son of Ravana) standing
in battle wielding a bow, becomes invisible."
"O, Rama! The glorious Indrajit, having propitiated the God of Fire, strikes his
enemy while remaining invisible in the battle field with a huge battle array (on both sides)"
"Mahodara and Mahaparsva along with a demon called Akampana who are equal to the
guardians of the world in battle - they are the commanders of his army."
"In the city of Lanka, are residing ten thousand crore demons, who can assume any
form at will and who consume flesh and blood as their staple food"
"King Ravana along with those demons made war against the guardians of the earth.
Those guardians of the earth along with the celestials were defeated by the wicked Ravana."
Hearing the aforesaid words of Vibhishana, Rama scrutinized them all attentively and
spoke the following words:
"O, Vibhishana! I indeed know those feats standing to the credit of Ravana, which
were told by you, as true."
"After killing Ravana along with Prahasta and his son (Indrajit), I will make you
the king. Hear this truth from me."
"Ravana may well plunge into Rasaatala (the penultimate subterranean region) or even
Paataala (the nethermost subterranean region) or seek the presence of Brahma and he will not be
left alive by me."
"I will not enter Ayodhya without killing Ravana together with his sons, companions
and relatives in battle. I take oath on my three brothers."
Hearing the words of that Rama, who was unwearied in action, the right minded
Vibhishana saluted him by bowing his head and started telling as follows:
"I will extend my help in killing the demons and in attacking the city of Lanka.
According to my strength, I will also penetrate into the army of the adversary to fight."
Rama on his part, duly delighted, embraced Vibhishana who was speaking as aforesaid
and spoke to Lakshmana as follows: "Bring some water from the ocean."
"O, Lakshmana who bestows honor on others! Quickly consecrate as a king of demons
this greatly intelligent Vibhishana with that water, so that I am pleased."
Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana consecrated Vibhishana as a king, as per the royal
instructions, amidst the leaders of monkeys.
Perceiving that instant graciousness in Rama, the monkeys cried, proclaiming
"excellent, excellent" about the high soled Rama.
Hanuman and Sugreeva asked Vibhishana as follows: " How can we cross the
imperturbable ocean, the habitation of Varuna, the god of water by all of us along with our army of
monkeys possessing a great splendor?"
"In what manner shall we along with the army swiftly cross the sea, the lord of
streams and rivers, and arrive at that strategy?"
Hearing their words, the right minded Vibhishana replied as follows: "It is apt if
prince Rama seeks ocean as his refuge"
"This immeasurable great ocean was excavated by Sagara*. Hence, this great ocean
will be inclined to do the act for Rama, his kinsman".
Hearing the aforesaid words of the learned demon Vibhishana, Sugreeva came to the
place where Rama and Lakshmana were there.
The long necked Sugreeva then started to tell the auspicious words of Vibhishana,
advising Rama to approach the ocean (to allow him a passage).
That advice found favor with Rama who by nature is of pious attitude. Then that
highly illustrious Rama replied to Sugreeva, the ruler of monkeys who was skillful in action and
who was accompanied by Lakshmana. Full of respect for Vibhishana's words, he told him as also his
brother Lakshmana smilingly as follows:
"O, Lakshmana! This idea of Vibhishana is agreeable to me. Sugreeva is a learned
person. You are ever wise in your thoughts. Both of you decide on the matter and inform whichever
is agreeable to you."
Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva and Lakshmana both, valiant as they were, spoke with
proper courtesy, the following words: .
"O, Rama the tiger among men! Why not Vibhishana's words, which are soothing at this
time of crisis be agreeable also to us?"
"Without constructing a bridge across this fiery ocean, which is an abode of Lord
Varuna, even the celestials and demons along with Indra cannot reach the city of Lanka."
"Let the valiant Vibhishana's words be followed suitably. It is enough that we have
already wasted our time. Let the ocean be commanded to yield a passage for the army to reach the
city being ruled by Ravana."
Having been thus exhorted, Rama then sat on the shore of the ocean covered with
blades of Kusha grass, as the God of Fire ascends the altar.Meanwhile, Rama the king of men and Sugreeva the Sovereign of monkeys, Hanuman the
son of the wind, Jambavan the king of the Bears, Vibhishana the demon, Angada the son of Vali,
Lakshmana, Sushena along with his kinsfolk, Mainda, Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Kumuda, Nala and
Panasa, all having reached the enemy's territory, assembled to take counsel together.
"Observe this city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana, impregnable both to celestials and the
demons together, or the uragas (the serpent-demons) and Gandharvas (celestial musicians)."
"Ravana, the lord of demons always stays in the City. Think of the ways and means
for the success of our expedition."
While they were talking thus, Vibhishana the younger brother of Ravana spoke the
following meaningful and polished words:
"My counsellors named Anala, Panasa, Sampati and Pramati went to the City of Lanka
and returned here."
"Assuming the form of birds, all the four entered that enemy's citadel and observed
the measures taken by Ravana closely."
"O, Rama! I give a detailed report as it was given to me of the defence-arrangements
made by tha evil-minded Ravana, hear me."
"The very strong Prashata is standing near the eastern gate. Mahaparshva and
Mahodara of mighty prowess are at the southern gate."
"Indragit, the son of Ravana is at the western gate along with many demons armed
with harpoons, swords, bows, spears and hammers together with warriors furnished with weapons of
various kinds."
"A prey to great anxiety, Ravana knower of magical formulas, is himself stationed at
the northern gate, along with several thousands of demons holding lances in their hand."
"As for Virupaksha he with mighty army carrying spears, clubs and bows along with
other demons, occupies the center of the fort."
"All these counsellors of mine watched those groups of troops arranged in Lanka in
this manner and immediately returned here."
"The elephants and chariots number some ten thousand each, the cavalry twenty
thousand and there are more than a crore foot soldiers. These strong and intrepid demons
endeavouring to kill someone in battle have ever been their sovereign's favourites."
"O, Rama! In these demons, a retinue of ten lacs each is near at hand for each
demon."
The mighty armed Vibhishana showed those counsellors to Rama after reporting the
aforesaid news pertaining to Lanka, thus informed by his counsellors.
The counsellors of Vibhishana themselves confirmed all that was known regarding
Lanka. Thereafter, the illustrious Vibhishana, in his desire to please Rama, addressed that
lotus-eyed one, further with the following words:
"O, Rama! When Ravana attacked Kubera in battle, sixty lacs of demons sallied forth
with him. All of them were akin to the evil-minded Ravana in prowess, in strength, in courage and
in pride."
"Indignation need not be resorted to (by you) based on this report. I am not
terrifying you, bt only arousing your wrath. You are indeed capable of overpowering even celestials
by your valour."
"Having set out these monkey-forces in battle-array, you shall destryoy Ravana with
this great army of monkeys, composed of four divisions, which surround you."
Vibhishana having spoken thus Rama gave the following orders for the attack of the
adversaries.
"At the eastern gate of Lanka, Nila that lion among monkeys for his part, surrounded
by many monkeys, should attack Prahasta."
"At the southern gate, Angada the son of Vali, surrounded by his mighty army, should
oppose Mahaparshva and Mahodara."
"Let Hanuman that son of the Wind and of inscrutable spirit, surrounded by a
multitude of monkeys, enter the City through the western gate."
I am myself determined to slay that wicked who owing to the boon he has received,
enjoys oppressing multitudes of Daityas (gaints) and Daanavas (demons), as also the magnanimous
sages and who ranges the world, persenting all being. With the aid of Lakshmana, I shall forcibly
enter the northern gate where Ravana is stationed along with his army."
"Let the mighty Sugreeva the king of monkeys, the valiant Jambavan the king of bears
and Vibhishana, the younger brother of the Lord of demons occupy the central position of the
army."
"Monkeys should not assume human form in the battle, for, in the army of monkeys,
this monkey-shape should serve as a sign of recognition among us."
"Among our own people also, the form of monkeys will become a sign of recognition
for us. Seven of us will attack the foe in our human form, I, my brother Lakshmana, who is full of
valour, my friend Vibhishana and his four companions."
Having said thus to Vibhishana for the success of the enterprise, Rama in the role
of a wise leader, decided to stay on Mount Suvela, after observing its charming slopes.
Thereafter, having covered the entire filed with his great army and having made up
his mind to destroy the enemies, that high-souled Rama of great courage, set out for Lanka with a
joyous and exultant air.Then, Nikumbha, Rabhasa, the exceedingly strong Surya satru, Suptaghna, Yaj~akopa,
Mahaparsva and Mahodara, the unconquerable demons Agniketu and Rasmiketu, then the powerful son of
Ravana named Indrajit endowed with great energy, Prahasta and Virupaksha, Vajradamstra who was
extraordinarily strong, Dhumarksha and Atikaya and the demon by name Durmukha, carrying iron clubs,
sharp-edged spears, spikes, darts, javelins and axes, bows with excellent arrows and swords shining
like a vast expanse of water, and who were all extremely enraged, and flaming as it were with
glory, those demons rose up and spoke to Ravana (as follows).
"Now itself, we shall kill Rama along with Lakshmana and Sugreeva as well as the
pitiable Hanuma by whom Lanka was attacked."
Vibhishana (Ravana's youngest half-brother) restraining all those who were made to
seize weapons, were made to sit again by saluting them with joined palms and spoke as follows:
"Dear brother! That act which cannot be accomplished by three well-known strategies
(viz . conciliation, gift and sowing dissention) , is only then to be accomplished by exhibiting
prowess, as stated by wise men."
"The gallantries performed according to the prescribed precept, after being tested,
O dear brother, only succeed against those who are indifferent, who have been already attacked by
an enemy or who stand struck down by fate."
"How do you wish to attack that famous Rama, who is always attentive, who has a will
to conquer, who is established in strength, who has subdued his anger and who is difficult to be
conquered."
"Who can conceive or even imagine in this world, that Hanuma's speed in crossing the
formidable ocean, which is the lord of streams and rivers?"
"O, demons! The strength and the abilities of the enemies are difficult to be
measured. They cannot be treated with contempt hastily by any means."
"What offence was done earlier to the king of demons by the illustrious Rama, whose
wife that he bore away from Janasthana?"
"Khara, who has gone beyond limits, was of course killed by Rama in an encounter.
Lives are certainly to be protected, according to one's own strength, by living beings."
"For this reason, a very great danger because of Seetha will occur to us. She, who
was brought here, is to be given away. What is the use in doing anything, with an animosity as an
end?"
"It is not appropriate to make enmity uselessly with Rama, who is valiant and who
follows righteousness. Let Seetha be given away to him."
Before the City of Lanka with its elephants, horses and many riches are shattered by
arrows, let Seetha be given away to him."
"Not so long as the huge army of monkeys which is very dangerous and unconquerable
attacks our Lanka, let Seetha be given away."
"If the beloved wife of Rama is not given away of your own accord, the city of Lanka
will indeed perish. All our valiant demons too will Perish."
"I am propitiating you because of my relationship. Act on my words. I am telling you
beneficial as well as truthful word. Let Seetha be given away to him."
"Before Rama the prince discharges for your destruction, very strong and unfailing
arrows equal to the rays of autumnal sun and provided with new heads and shafts, let Seetha be
given away to Rama."
"Abandon soon your anger, which destroys happiness and piety. Resort to
righteousness, which augments joy and fame. Become placid so that we may live with our sons and
relatives. Let Seetha be given away to Rama."
After hearing Vibhishana's words, Ravana the king of demons left all of them and
entered his own palace.
While Lakshmana, who was so fond of his brother, was consoling Rama, Vibhishana,
keeping the troops of simian army in their respective positions, arrived there.
That Vibhishana, surrounded by four warriors, wielding many types of weapons, and
who were chiefs of troops, looking like heaps of black collyrium and who were appearing like
elephants, approached Lakshmana who was totally engrossed in sorrow and saw the monkeys also, whose
eyes were filled with tears.
Vibhishana also saw the great-souled Rama, the delight of Inkshvaku dynasty fallen
into a swoon and resting on the lap of Lakshmana.
On seeing the embarrassed Rama, tormented with grief, that Vibhishana, distressed as
he was in spirits, with agony inside, asked him, "What is this?"
Fixing his gaze on Vibhishana's face and looking at Sugreeva and those monkeys,
Lakshmana with tears pouring down, spoke the following words, with a splendid meaning:
"O gentle Sir! Just on hearing through the words of Hanuma, saying that Seetha was
killed by Indrajit, Rama entered into a swoon."
Intercepting the narrating Lakshmana in the middle, Vibhishana spoke the following
amply meaningful words to Rama, who was in an unconscious state.
"I hold that which you have been told by Hanuma with a sorrowful temper, O ruler of
men, to be absurd as the drying up of the sea."
"O the long armed! I know the design of the evil-minded Ravana towards Seetha. He
would never do the killing of Seetha."
"Eventhough begged by me, the well-wisher, several times to give up Seetha, he did
not heed that advice."
"It is neither possible even to see her by recourse to conciliation nor by bestowing
gifts nor by sowing dissention. How is it possible then by a war? By any other strategy, it is
impossible."
"That Indrajit for his part retracted, by hoodwinking the monkeys. O the long armed!
Know that Seetha (who was seemingly killed by him) as illusory."
"After reaching a sanctuary by name Nikumbhila, this Indrajit will pour oblations
into the sacred fire. On returning after pouring oblations into the sacred fire, Indrajit will
prove difficult to be overcome in battle, even by celestials including Indra."
"Certainly, this conjuring trick (in the form of killing an illusory living effigy
of Seetha) was exhibited by him, who was employing his magical art, expecting interruption by the
prowess of the monkeys there."
"While the sacrificial performance is not ended, we shall proceed to that place,
along with an army. O the foremost of men! Give up this improper grief, which has come upon you.
Seeing you tormented with grief, the entire army is sinking into despondency."
"Very exalted as you are in courage, stay you here, confident at heart, and send
Lakshmana with us, who are taking an army along with us."
"This Lakshmana, the eminent prince, can make Indrajit abandon that act of
sacrifice, by employing his sharp arrows. Then, he will be susceptible of being killed."
"Lakshmana's arrows, which are sharp and fiery, with a speed equal to the wings of a
bird, can drink his blood like cruel birds."
"O the long-armed one! Therefore, dispatch Lakshmana having auspicious body-marks
even as Indra the lord of celestials employed the thunderbolt to kill Indrajit."
"O the best of men! It is not appropriate to delay the killing of the enemy any
further now. Therefore, grant permission to Lakshmana to destroy the enemy, as Indra would hurl his
thunderbolt to destroy the enemies of celestials."
"If that Indrajit, the foremost of demons completes the sacrifice, he would not be
visible even to the celestials and the demons in battle. If he come with a desire to fight, after
ending that sacrifice, the celestials also will feel a great suspicion on their own lives."Having seen the destruction of Ravana, those gods, celestial musicians and demons,
while chatting about the auspicious narrative, went away in their respective aerial cars.
Chatting themselves about the awful destruction of Ravana, the terrific prowess of
Rama, the admirable combat of the monkeys, the counsel tendered by Sugreeva, the affection and
valour of Lakshmana; the son of Sumitra; the loyaltyof Seetha to her husband and about the strength
of Hanuma, the illustrious celestials and others rejoicingly returned as they had come.
Taking leave of the celestial chariot, which had been given by Indra the lord of
celestials and which shone like fire, the mighty armed Rama respectfully saluted Matali.
As assented by Rama, Matali Indra's charioteer, mounting that celestial chariot,
ascended to the heaven itself.
When Matali ascended to heaven along with his chariot, Rama, the foremost one among
the chariot-warriors was highly rejoiced and embraced Sugreeva.
Having embraced Sugreeva greeted by Lakshmana and having been honoured by the
monkey-troops. Rama came to the camp where the army had been stationed.
Then, Rama spoke (as follows) to Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, who was endowed with
strength and having auspicious marks, who stayed nearby.
"O the benevolent Lakshmana! Consecrate on the throne of Lanka, this Vibhishana to
whom everyone is attached, a loyal person as he is and the one who has formerly done a service to
us."
"O gentle one! This s my paramount desire that I should see this Vibhishana, the
brother of Ravana being consecrated for throne in Lanka."
Hearing the words of the great soled Rama, Lakshmana replied, 'so it be' and
rejoicingly procured a golden pot.
That mighty Lakshmana, then placing that pot in the hands of the monkey-chiefs,
instructed them, who were as swift as thought, to bring sea-water.
Thereupon, those excellent monkeys, with the swiftness of thought, moving very
quickly from that place, returned, having obtained the water from the sea.
Thereupon, Lakshmana together with his friends, taking one pot and making Vibhishana
to sit on the throne, sprinkled him with sea-water from that pot in accordance with the rule
prescribed in Vedic scriptures, while the demons were witnessing the ceremony, to make him the king
for Lanka, as directed by Rama.
Then, all the demons as well as the monkeys consecrated Vibhishana. Having gained
extra ordinary delight, they indeed eulogized Rama.
Seeing Vibhishana the lord of demons consecrated for the throne of Lanka, his four
counsellors who were always together with him and such of those demons who were devoted to him,
were rejoiced.
Rama together with Lakshmana were greatly delighted. That Vibhishana, having gained
that great kingdom bestowed on him by Rama, was also greatly delighted.
After consoling his people, Vibhishana then sought to presence of Rama. Now, the
demons who were residing in the city were quite delighted and brought to him (by way of presents)
curds, unbroken grains of rice, sweets shaped like balls, parched grains of unhusked rice and
flowers too.
Accepting them, the valiant and unconquerable Vibhishana happily offered all those
auspicious objects to Rama and Lakshmana.
Seeing Vibhishana, who had accomplished his act and increased his resources, Rama
accepted it all, with a sole desire to show gratefulness to him.
Thereupon, Rama spoke the following words to the valiant Hanuma the monkey who was
equal in size to a mountain and who was standing in humility, with his hands joined in
salutation.
"O the benevolent one! Taking permission from this Vibhishana, the great king and
entering into the City of Lanka, inform about our welfare to Seetha."
"O Hanuma, the proficient one in speech! Inform Seetha that myself together with
Lakshmana and Sugreeva are well and that Ravana had been killed in battle."
"O Hanuma the master of monkeys! Making clear this favourite news to Seetha, you
ought to return, taking back her message."Then in his turn that demon Viradha said this sentence filling the forest with his gruesome voice, "I am asking you, really... 
tell me who you are and whereto you wish to go? " 
Then that highly resplendent Rama said about his Ikshvaku dynasty to the blazing faced demon who is insistent. 
"Know us as Kshatriya-s with ennobled bearing, and we are trekking the forest...but we wish to know about you, who are you 
that move about in Dandaka forest? 
Viradha said to that truly valiant Rama, "Ah! I'll tell you, oh king, be informed of me, oh Raghava... 
"I am the son of Java indeed... my mother is Shatahradaa, and all the demons on earth call me Viradha...'
"On my undertaking ascesis I derived a boon from the beneficence of Brahma, by which I will neither be cut, nor slit, nor 
killed with a weapon in this world..."
"Leave off this lady without any yearning for her, and you expeditiously flee-away as you have come, then your lives will 
not be snatched away... 
Rama in reply said this to that ogre Viradha, whose eyes are fully bloodshot in anger, who is monstrous in his body, and 
evil in intent... 
"You knave, fie upon you... you are in quest of you own death for your meanly measures, and definitely you will get it in 
this confrontation. Stay! I will not let you to live... 
Then, stringing his bow Rama indeed darted very sharp arrows, very quickly and well aiming the demon... 
Indeed seven arrows are let off with perfectly stringed bow, which have golden vanes, and very fast ones that equal the 
flights of Garuda, the Divine Eagle and the Air-god. 
But, they the arrows that are akin to infernos and dressed with peacock feathers as their fins, on piercing the body of 
Viradha they fell onto the ground besmirched with blood. 
When that demon is thus struck, then he placed Vaidehi down from his arms, hauled up his spear, and very angrily rushed 
towards Rama and Lakshmana. 
And holding fast his spear that is similar to the Indra's Flagstaff he blaringly yelled a ghastly shriek, and thus he shone 
forth like the wide-mouthed Death, ready-to-gulp. 
Then with an effulgent arrow-rain those two brothers incessantly rained on demon Viradha, who is similar to the terminator 
of lifetime. 
He that highly horrendous demon laughed at that arrow-shower, and standing for a while he yawned, and on his yawning and 
stretching his limbs in fatigue those arrows that earlier have gone speedily, spilled out from his body that speedily. 
Demon Viradha held back his lives by the touch of boon, and raising up the spear he ran quickly at Rama and Lakshmana. 
The best wielder of weaponry Rama ripped that spear apart, which is akin to the Thunderbolt of Indra, and that which is 
like a blaze in the sky, with two arrows in the sky itself. 
Shattered by Rama's blazing shafts that spear fallen on ground like the boulder mass of Mt. Meru when it is shattered by 
Indra's Thunderbolt. 
They quickly upraised their swords and like a pair of up-swinging black-cobras they rapidly crashed on him, and then battered 
him mightily. 
He that demon thus beaten very firmly by Rama and Lakshmana, then on grabbing those unwavering ones and manly tigers with 
his arms, that furious demon wished to carry them away. 
Knowing the thinking of the demon for sure, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, "Let him easily carry us anywhere on his way... 
"Let this demon carry us as he wishes, and Saumitri, by which way this night-walker goes, that alone will be our way... 

But he that night-walker arrogant as he is by his might has uplifted Rama and Lakshmana like babies by that might and courage 
alone, and placed them on his shoulders as one would place babies. 
That nightwalker Viradha on placing those two Raghava-s on his shoulders gone towards deeper forest yelling very luridly. 

That demon entered into a baffling forest that is like a very dark cloud in its sheen, where a variety of massive trees 
are contained in, numerous flocks of vulturine birds are overspreading, and where wild jackals and other predaceous animals 
are sprawling around, along with Rama and Lakshmana. 
Ikshvaku dynasty is of long lineage. This is Surya Vamsha, Solar dynasty of Kshatriya-s, of which Mahaa Kavi Kalidasa wondered 
as to how it can be narrated, for it is of a long lineage and he admireskvaH suurya prabhavo vamshH...in his 
Raghu Vamsha Mahaa Kaavya, at -. This dynasty may be known to understand why from Viradha to Ravana, wanted to die at 
the hands of Rama. The list of those kings is compiled inaananda raamayanaand the same is being given hereunder...Then, on staying that night there in Tataka forest, on the next day 
			morning the greatly renowned sage Vishvamitra, smilingly and wording 
			sweetly spoke to Rama. 
"I am highly pleased with you, oh, illustrious prince Rama, let safety 
			be with you, I will now give you all of the divine missiles in utmost 
			fondness of mine. 
"I am going to accord all of those divine missiles by which scores of 
			gods, demons, or even from gandharva-s, uragaa-s and the like, or even 
			earthlings are dominated, humbled down and conquered in war. Let safety 
			be with you. 
"Raghava, I am going to give the highly divine Danda disc ; next, oh, best one among men, Dharma disc  and 
			like that kaala disc ; then oh, brave one, Vishnu disc; similarly 
			oh, dextrous Rama, Indra disc and Thunderbolt missile; the best trident 
			pertaining to Shiva; the missile called Brahma-shira ; 
			the missile called the Aishiika missile  and that 
			way oh, Raghava, I am going to give the unexcelled and highly formidable 
			missile called Brahma missile. 
"Oh manly tiger prince Rama, I am going to accord two maces that are 
			brilliant by their radiance called, the Modaki,  and Shikhari, 
			 
"Oh, Rama, like that I will be giving three nooses called Dharma paasha 
			and kaala-paasha and Varuna paasha,  as well as an unequalled missile called Varuna astra, Rain-god's 
			missile. 
"Oh, Raghu's scion, I will also give two projectile bolts, one called 
			shushka  and the other aardra  and even 
			the missiles of Pinaaka and that of Narayana,  I will give. 
"Oh, impeccable Rama, thus a well-known missile shikhari  
			and another the fond of Fire-god known as prathama  and 
			a missile of Air-god too, I will be giving. 
"Oh, Raghava of Kakutstha-s, I will give you two missiles named Haya-shira 
			 and Krouncha  and two Impellers, one 
			presided over by the power of Vishnu, and the other by the power of 
			Rudra. 
"I will be giving all those weapons that are wielded by demons, namely 
			the deadly Pounder named Kankaalam, and Rods named as Kapaalam and Kankanam, 
			for the elimination of those very demons. 
"Oh, mighty armed son of the best king, I am giving a great missile 
			named Vaidyadhara by its name, and a gem of sword named Nandana. 
"Thus, the missile which is very much liked by Gandharva-s, namely Mohana, 
			 the missile called Prasvapana  
			and the gentle Prashamana  
"Oh, highly fortunate Rama, take these missiles namely, varshaNa,  shoshana  santaapana  vilaapana 
			 and oh, prince, an unassailable intoxicator and 
			a dear missile of Manmatha, namely Mohana  and another 
			the fond missile of gandharva-s namely maanava by its name,  and oh, tigerly man, a missile dear one to pishaaca-s, monsters, 
			namely paishaca  
"Oh, manly-tiger Rama, greatly powered taamasa and saumana missiles, 
			the indomitable missiles like samvarta, mausala, satya, and then the 
			maaya-maya missile; like that oh, mighty armed Rama, a solar missile 
			the sequestrator of others' brilliance namely teja-prabha; next, the 
			missile of Moon-god named shishira ; and a very deadly missile 
			of tvaSTa namely sudaamana; and even the dangerous missile of bhaga 
			namely shita-iSu, these and the maanava missile of Manu, the earliest 
			ruler of mankind, I will be giving. 
"These missiles are, oh, dextrous prince, disguise-wizards, greatly 
			powered, and highly providential ones, oh, Rama, you may take them forthwith." 
			So said sage Vishvamitra to Rama. 
That pre-eminent sage Vishvamitra on performing his personal holy depuration 
			then gave the assortment of extraordinary hymns to Rama facing eastward. 
			
The comprehension of which invoking hymns of the missiles is impossible 
			even to gods with their sections and subsections of procedures, that 
			Brahman dedicated such hymns to Raghava. 
While that intelligent saint Vishvamitra chanted the hymns, all of those 
			highly venerable missiles came nigh and stood accessible to Raghava 
			in their astral form. 
All of those highly obliging missiles in astral bodies, gladdening to 
			come under the aegis of Rama, then spoke to him making palms-fold, "here 
			are your thralls, Sire, we are here to accomplish whatever you bid us 
			to do, let safety be with you." So said the deities presiding over the 
			missiles to Rama. 
On receiving them with a pleased heart, then Rama patted them with his 
			palm, and that Rama of Kakutstha-s also spoke this way to those mightily 
			forceful missiles in ethereal bodies saying, "you may manifest yourselves 
			in my cognisance whenever I need you," and he motivated them to take 
			leave and to come back at his beck and call. 
That highly resplendent Rama revered sage Vishvamitra with a thankful 
			heart and readied himself for further journey. Then on seeing the flurrying warriors earlier created by the Sacred Cow, Shabala, who are perplexed 
by the missiles of Vishvamitra, Vashishta started to motivate her, 'oh, wish-milker, generate more forces 
by your yogic capacity.' Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra 
to Rama. 
"From the 'hums' of her mooing Kaamboja-s similar to sunshine are born, from her udder Pahlava-s wielding 
weaponry are born, from the area of her privates Yavana-s, likewise from her rectal area Shaka-s, and 
from her hair-roots Mleccha-s, Haariitaa-s along with Kirataka-s are issued forth. 
At that very moment, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, Vishvamitra's army comprising foot-soldiers, elephants, 
chariots and horses is utterly slaughtered by the Yavana, Mleccha etc., forces generated by the Sacred 
Cow. 
On seeing their army utterly slaughtered by the vital spirit of Vashishta, a band of hundred sons of 
Vishvamitra wielding divers weapons exasperatedly sprinted forth towards that supreme meditator among 
all meditators. But that great sage Vashishta completely burnt all of them down just by blasting 'hum' 
sounds. 
That sage with vital spirit, Vashishta, then in a wink rendered those sons of Vishvamitra, along with 
their horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers to ashes. 
On seeing his sons and his forces are utterly ruined, that very highly glorious Vishvamitra was disgraced 
and beset by distress. 
Like a tideless ocean his warfare did not tide him over, like a fangless serpent his hiss of warring 
could not fang any, like a wingless bird pitiable is his flightless plight of fightback, like a shineless 
sun in an eclipse, Vishvamitra plunged into a lustreless state of his own illustriousness, when his 
forces are ruined along with his sons. 
When all his intrepidity and impetuosity are ruined an indolence bechanced upon him, and then on bidding 
one son for the kingdom, 'you rule the earth with the duties of kingcraft...' thus saying Vishvamitra 
took recourse to forests. 
On going to the mountainsides of Himalayas, whereat it is adored by kinnaraa-s and uragaa-s, the nymphs 
and nymphean serpents, he that great practiser of ascesis, Vishvamitra, undertook an austere ascesis 
for the sake of beneficence of the Great God, Shiva. 
After a long lost time, Shiva, the God of Gods whose flag bears the sign of Holy Bull, has shown himself 
to that great-saint Vishvamitra, for He is a ready boon-giver. 
'Oh, king, for which purpose you undertook this ascesis that you may tell me. What is it really intended 
by you and what boon you seek that be made known to me for I am the boon-giver.' Shiva said so to Vishvamitra. 

Thus said by God Shiva to Vishvamitra of great ascesis, Vishvamitra on reverencing that Great God Shiva 
said this way. 
Oh! Mahadeva, the Impeccable Great God... providing that you are gladdened by my ascetic devotion,dhanurveda, the Holy Writ of Archery, with its complemental and supplemental 
Writs, and along with its summationalUpanishad-s, together with its preternatural 
doctrines... they may kindly be bestowed upon me... 
' Oh, Exquisite God, whichever missile is there either with gods, or fiends, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, 
and demons, let it dawn upon me. For you alone are the God of Gods your blessings alone can fulfil my 
aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra entreated God Shiva. 
'So be it!' On sanctifying Vishvamitra and his aspiration thus, the God of Gods, Shiva disappeared. 

Vishvamitra who is already a mightier Kshatriya, now on acquiring missiles from the God of Gods, Shiva, 
will he not come forth paired up with mightiest conceit, and then will not his conceitedness be plethoric 
like a plethoric ocean? 
By vitality Vishvamitra is like an ocean with rough riptide on a Full Moon day, and oh, Rama, he deemed 
that sagaciously mighty sage Vashishta is now 'dead.' 
Then on going to the threshold of Vashishta 's hermitage that king propelled his missiles, by the holocaust 
of which missiles that ascetic woodland is completely burnt down in its entirety. 
On seeing the turbo-jetting missiles of Vishvamitra jetted by his sparkling intellect, hundreds of 
saints were frightened and they very speedily fled in hundreds of ways. 
Whoever is the disciple of Vashishta and whichever is either animal or a bird, all are utterly frightened 
and thousands of them have hastily fled to numerous directions. 
The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta's hermitage fell void, and in a wink it has become silent 
like a burial ground as every shrub, herb and tree is cindery, and every bird, animal and stock is an 
evacuee. 
Although Vashishta shouted at them saying time and again, 'do not fear, do not fear... now I will dissipate 
that son of Gaadhi, Vishvamitra, like Sun demisting the mist,' all the inmates of hermitage have hastily 
fled. 
On saying that way to the evacuees, Vashishta, the great-resplendent sage and a best one among best 
meditators rancorously said this word to Vishvamitra. 
You senseless king, by which reason you have havocked this hermitage that is well nourished for a 
long time by me, for that reason you have become a reprehensible one, and thereby you will not survive 
any longer. 
"On saying thus that extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta post-hastily up-heaved his baton, which is 
alike the fumeless Ultimate Fire of End Time, and the other baton of Yama, the Terminator, and affronted 
Vishvamitra." Thus, Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. On becoming personally purified Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha-s, 
			received the missiles, and then on their way he is now speaking to Sage 
			Vishvamitra with a pleasant face. 
"Oh, godly sage, I have taken the missiles and became unassailable even 
			for gods, but oh, eminent sage, I wish to know the annulment of missiles 
			too." So said Rama to the sage. 
When Rama of Kakutstha said thus, next that resolute, well-averred and 
			purified sage of eminence Vishvamitra imparted the knowledge of annulment 
			missiles. 
Gladdening in his heart of hearts Rama of Kakutstha received the annulment 
			missiles saying, "Agreed! Sire!" Those missiles are with radiantly divine 
			bodies, appealing and endowing bliss. Some are fire-like, some smoke-like, 
			and some moon-like and some sun-like, and such as they are, some of 
			them holding out their hollowed palms, and some with palms adjoined 
			melodiously spoke to Rama saying, "here we are, oh, tigerly man, what 
			can we do for you." 
"While remaining in my memory you assist me as and when needed, and 
			till then you may go away as you wish," thus that legatee of Raghu-s said 
			to those deities of annulment missiles. 
Saying "it will be done that way" to Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha-s, 
			also on performing circumambulation to him and then on taking his consent 
			those deities have gone away as they have come. 
After learning the nullifying missiles and then while proceeding on 
			the walkway Raghava asked the great sage Vishvamitra with sweet and 
			soft words. 
"What is this cloudlike picturesque thicket shining forth not very far 
			away on this side of mountain, with animals spreading over it, and embellished 
			with numerous kinds of birds that have pleasant callings it is highly 
			soul-delighting, thus, my inquisitiveness is growing very much to know 
			it, what is this, really! 
"By the nature of happy environs at this place, oh, eminent sage, I 
			understand that we have come out of the extremely alarming forest of 
			Tataka, but oh, god, whose hermitage's threshold is this, kindly tell 
			me all. 
"Oh, great saint, where are those murderers of Brahmans? Oh, venerable 
			one, at which place those evil minded sinners and evildoers will be 
			coming to hinder your ritual? And where, oh, Brahman, I have to safeguard 
			your ritual ceremonies, and demons too are to be eliminated? Oh, eminent 
			sage, what is that place? I would like to hear all of it." Rama asked 
			Vishvamitra in that way. "Oh, enemy-chastener Rama, when the Divine Cow Shabala is spoken in this way by Sage Vashishta, then 
that milker bestowed each and every fancy, fancied by each and every fancier, according to one's own 
fancy." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shabala or Kaamadhenu, as a part of the legend 
of Vishvamitra to Rama and others. 
Shabala bestowed dishes of sugar cane and honey, and flakes of all sorts, like cornflakes, rice-flakes, 
also best arracks and liquors in best wineglasses, further, the drinks and foodstuffs that are very 
diverse and verily apposite to royalties and army-men. 
There emerged mountainous stacks of steamy foodstuffs, palatable side-dishes and desserts of rice 
etc., also the dumplings of cooked pulses, like that the cascades of curds and the other milk products 
like butter, ghee, cheese etc. Thousands of silver dishes and hollowware fully replete with daintily 
soft drinks, like that full with sugar-candy preparations, and with preparations that comprise all the 
six tastes have come up together with delectable foodstuffs made out of treacly dumplings of cane sugar. 

Oh, Rama, all of the men in the forces of Vishvamitra, who are already rejoiced and regaled by the 
regular feasts accorded by their king Vishvamitra, are now comparatively well gladdened when feasted 
by Sage Vashishta, in which they rejoiced and regaled, for a good measure. 
Partaking that feast together with the best royal ladies of palace chambers, and with the court-scholars 
and the court-priests even the king Vishvamitra, who by his nature is a kingly sage, became exultant 
and energetic. 
When honoured along with his advisers, ministers and attendants by way of receiving a royal banquet, 
king Vishvamitra then in high admiration spoke this to Vashishta. 
You showed me a generous hospitality whereby I am esteemed by an estimable sage like you, oh, expert 
in sententiousness, now I wish to say for myself to which you may please listen. 
'Oh, godly sage, this Shabala may be given to me for a barter of a lakh, a hundred thousand, cows. 
Indeed this do-all cow is a treasure, and the kings are the gatherers of treasures. Therefore bestow 
this cow to me. As rule this cow also belongs to me.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Vashishta. 
When Vishvamitra addressed him in that way, the reverential sage Vashishta, who is a virtue-souled 
eminent saint, on his part replied the king in this way. 
I cannot afford Shabala, neither by the barter of a hundred thousand cows, nor by hundreds of millions 
of cows, nor by lots and lots of silver, either. 
Abandoning her from my proximity is unmeet for her, oh, enemy-subjugator, you cannot even subjugate 
me terroristically and try to wean this cow away from me, as Shabala is everlastingly and inseparably 
mine, as with the everlasting and inseparable respectability of a self-respectful person. 
This cow makes the journey of my life possible. Oblations to gods or manes, enkindling of Ritual-fire, 
religious sacrifices,homa-s, the sacred rituals conducted asdarshapaurNamaasi, all are dependent on her. 
This cow is the bedrock for everything in its entirety, and regarding diverse and numerous indoctrinations, 
and even for add-on syllabics likesvaahaa, vaSaT, they are all dependent 
on this cow, there is no doubt about it. 
"In truth, this cow is everything to me and ever-gratifier, that way by so many reasons, oh, king, 
I cannot afford Shabala to you or to anyone." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. 
Though Vashishta spoke thus Vishvamitra being an expert in sententiousness then spoke this sentence 
compellingly and argumentatively. 
I bestow upon you fourteen thousand elephants adorned with golden girdles, golden necklets and golden 
goads. 
I will grant you eight hundred golden chariots whichever can be yoked on with four whitely-white 
horses trimmed up with the sets of tintinnabulating bells. 
I grant you, oh, superbly vowed sage, eleven thousand fleetly galloping horses of high pedigree born 
in best countries of best horse breeding. 
I award ten million diversely coloured and differently divisionalized cows, whichever of them will 
be came of age as milker, thereby, let this do-all cow Shabala be given to me. 
"Or, oh, eminent Brahman, if you yearn either for gems or gold, I gift that much of everything as 
much as you can yearn, let Shabala be given to me." Thus Vishvamitra entreated again. 
When the shrewd king Vishvamitra spoke to the reverential sage Vashishta, that sage has clearly said, 
'whatever it is oh, king, I do not surrender Shabala, the cow.' 
Really this alone is my gemmy cow, thus I do not require your jewels or gems... truly, this alone 
is my treasure, thus I do not require your gilded chariots, horses or elephants... really, this alone 
is my everything, thus I need nothing from you... and actually, this alone is my alter-ego, thus you 
cannot separate me from myself. 
This alone is mydarsha-puurNamaasarituals, and like that this alone 
is all my Vedic-rituals with worthwhile donations and oh, king, this essentially is of service in diverse 
activities of mine. 
" Oh, king, all of my activities are instated in this cow, then wherefore a lot of palavering a bargain 
or barter? I do not give away this milker any wish." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra, and thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of the legend of Sacred Cow. Later when the Omnipresent Narayana is thus nominated by best gods, and though he knows the 
outcome, he gently spoke these words to gods in this way. 
"What is the idea to eliminate that demon's chief Ravana, oh, gods, adopting which strategy 
I will have to eliminate that thorn in the side of sages?" Thus Vishnu asked the gods. 
Asked thus all the gods said to that sempiternal Vishnu, "on assuming a human form, eliminate 
Ravana in a war." 
"Oh, destroyer of enemies, he that Ravana undertook a vehement ascesis for a long period, 
thereby the creator of worlds and the first born one Brahma, felt gladsome of his ascesis. 

"Satisfied with his ascesis Brahma gave boon to that demon that he shall have no fear for 
his life from many kinds of beings, excepting humans, because that demon indeed slighted humans 
earlier at the time of bestowing boon. 
"Thus, on getting boon from the Forefather Brahma he has become arrogant and torturing the 
three worlds, and he is even abducting women. As such, oh, enemy destroyer Vishnu, his elimination 
is envisaged through humans alone." So said gods to Vishnu. 
On hearing that speech of gods said that way, he that kind-hearted Vishnu then chose Dasharatha 
as his father in human world. 
During that time the great resplendent king and an enemy subduer Dasharatha is performingputrakaameSTiritual, desiring progeny as he is sonless. 
On taking a decision Vishnu took leave of Forefather Brahma, and vanished while he is still 
being extolled by gods and sages. 
Then, from Fire of Altar Dasharatha's ritual there emerged a greatly vigorous and energetic 
Divine Being with an unparalleled resplendence, calledyajna-puruSa. 

He is clad in black and red garments and his face is red and his voice resembled the drumbeat. 
His moustache and hairdo are soft like that of a lion's mane. 
And he is endowed with auspicious features and decorated with divine ornaments, in height 
he is like a mountain peak, and in valiance he is like an imperious tiger. 
That great ritual being personally brought a big golden vessel carrying it with both of his 
hands as if he would personally handle his own wife, which vessel is made from the molten 
gold and covered with a silver lid, and which appeared to be crafted out of a divine illusion, 
since it is dazzling like sun and glowing like the tongues of flame, and that vessel is full 
with the divine dessert. 
That divine person on observing king Dasharatha said these words "oh, king, you may know me 
as the being sent by Prajapati." 
There after, king Dasharatha greeted that divine being with palms adjoining and said in reply, 
"oh, god, welcome to you, and what shall I do for you?" 
Then again, that divine being sent by Prajapati said these words, "oh, king, now you have 
obtained this dessert in golden vessel as you have propitiated gods. 
"Oh, tigerly king, take this dessert prepared by divinities, this is a blessed dessert that 
enriches progeny and health. 
"Oh, king, let this be consumed" saying so he further said, "for which purpose you have performed 
this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give 
this among your eligible wives." So said the divine being to Dasharatha. 
Agreeing to that the king wholeheartedly took that god-given golden vessel full with divine 
food. 
With high ecstasy Dasharatha revered that Ritual Being, thePrajaapati- 
PuruShaoryaj~na-puruSha, an astonishing and delightful 
being in his appearance, and performed circumambulations around him. 
On obtaining that dessert prepared by gods then Dasharatha is highly gladdened like a pauper 
obtaining unforeseen wealth. 
On completing his work of giving the golden vessel with dessert then that divine being who 
is astonishing by his form and highly glowing by his physique, disappeared then and there 
itself. 
Lit up with beams of happiness Dasharatha's palace chambers shone forth like the autumnal 
sky brightened with moonbeams. 
Then Dasharatha on entering palace chambers spoke this to queen Kausalya, "Receive this dessert 
to beget your son." 
The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the half, i.e., 
one fourth to queen Sumitra. And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one 
eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, 
i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to 
his wives differently. 
On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with 
happiness, deemed it as a reward. 
Then on consuming dessert those best ladies of the king whose resplendence then vied with 
that Fire and Sun became pregnant after some time. 
Then on seeing his queens with confirmed pregnancies Dasharatha regained his lost heart for 
sons, and he is gladdened like Vishnu, who will always be gladsome when worshipped by gods, 
namely Indra and others, as well as by the assemblages of great souls, sages. 
